949,Lessons learned from the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic,2010-01-07,"The 1918 influenza pandemic was one of the most virulent strains of influenza in history. Phylogenic evidence of the novel H1N1 strain of influenza discovered in Mexico last spring (2009) links it to the 1918 influenza strain. With information gained from analyzing viral genetics, public health records and advances in medical science we can confront the 2009 H1N1 influenza on a global scale. The paper analyses the causes and characteristics of a pandemic, and major issues in controlling the spread of the disease. Wide public vaccination and open communication between government and health sciences professionals will be an essential and vital component in managing the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and any future pandemics.","Hollenbeck, James E.",Indian J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3450197/,250
3430,Review of global sanitation development,2018-11-11,"The implementation of the United Nations (UN) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has resulted in an increased focus on developing innovative, sustainable sanitation techniques to address the demand for adequate and equitable sanitation in low-income areas. We examined the background, current situation, challenges, and perspectives of global sanitation. We used bibliometric analysis and word cluster analysis to evaluate sanitation research from 1992 to 2016 based on the Science Citation Index EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases. Our results show that sanitation is a comprehensive field connected with multiple categories, and the increasing number of publications reflects a strong interest in this research area. Most of the research took place in developed countries, especially the USA, although sanitation problems are more serious in developing countries. Innovations in sanitation techniques may keep susceptible populations from contracting diseases caused by various kinds of contaminants and microorganisms. Hence, the hygienization of human excreta, resource recovery, and removal of micro-pollutants from excreta can serve as effective sustainable solutions. Commercialized technologies, like composting, anaerobic digestion, and storage, are reliable but still face challenges in addressing the links between the political, social, institutional, cultural, and educational aspects of sanitation. Innovative technologies, such as Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs), and struvite precipitation, are at the TRL (Technology readiness levels) 8 level, meaning that they qualify as “actual systems completed and qualified through test and demonstration.” Solutions that take into consideration economic feasibility and all the different aspects of sanitation are required. There is an urgent demand for holistic solutions considering government support, social acceptability, as well as technological reliability that can be effectively adapted to local conditions.","Zhou, Xiaoqin; Li, Zifu; Zheng, Tianlong; Yan, Yichang; Li, Pengyu; Odey, Emmanuel Alepu; Mang, Heinz Peter; Uddin, Sayed Mohammad Nazim",Environ Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6192828/,250
7451,"Assessment of the Status of Measles Elimination in the United States, 2001–2014",2017-04-01,"The marine dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium includes a number of species that produce potent neurotoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning, which in humans may cause muscular paralysis, neurological symptoms and, in extreme cases, death. Because of the genetic diversity of different genera and species, molecular tools may help to detect the presence of target microorganisms in marine field samples. Here we employed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for the rapid and simple detection of toxic Alexandrium species. A set of four primers were designed based upon the conserved region of the 5.8S rRNA gene of members of the genus Alexandrium. Using this detection system, toxic Alexandrium genes were amplified and visualized as a ladder-like pattern of bands on agarose gels under isothermal condition within 60 min. The LAMP amplicons were also directly visualized by eye in the reaction tube by the addition of SYBR Green I. This LAMP assay was 10-fold more sensitive than a conventional PCR method with a detection limit of 5 cells per tube when targeting DNA from Alexandrium minutum. The LAMP assay reported here indicates the potential usefulness of the technique as a valuable simple, rapid alternative procedure for the detection of target toxic Alexandrium species during coastal water monitoring.","Wang, Li; Li, Lin; Alam, M.

14710,Gun Violence Exposure and Experiences of Depression Among Mothers,2021-01-13,"PURPOSE: We examined self‐reported financial toxicity and out‐of‐pocket expenses among adult women with breast cancer. METHODS: Patients spoke English, Spanish, or Mandarin Chinese, were aged 18+ years, had stage I–IIIA breast cancer, and were eligible for breast‐conserving and mastectomy surgery. Participants completed surveys about out‐of‐pocket costs and financial toxicity at 1 week, 12 weeks, and 1 year postsurgery. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety‐five of 448 eligible patients (88.2%) from the parent trial completed surveys. Excluding those reporting zero costs, crude mean ± SD out‐of‐pocket costs were $1,512 ± $2,074 at 1 week, $2,609 ± $6,369 at 12 weeks, and $3,308 ± $5,000 at 1 year postsurgery. Controlling for surgery, cancer stage, and demographics with surgeon and clinic as random effects, higher out‐of‐pocket costs were associated with higher financial toxicity 1 week and 12 weeks postsurgery (p < .001). Lower socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with lower out‐of‐pocket costs at each time point (p = .002–.013). One week postsurgery, participants with lower SES reported financial toxicity scores 1.02 points higher than participants with higher SES (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08–1.95). Black and non‐White/non‐Black participants reported financial toxicity scores 1.91 (95% CI, 0.46–3.37) and 2.55 (95% CI, 1.11–3.99) points higher than White participants. Older (65+ years) participants reported financial toxicity scores 2.58 points lower than younger (<65 years) participants (95% CI, −3.41, −1.74). Younger participants reported significantly higher financial toxicity at each time point. DISCUSSION: Younger age, non‐White race, and lower SES were associated with higher financial toxicity regardless of costs. Out‐of‐pocket costs increased over time and were positively associated with financial toxicity. Future work should reduce the impact of cancer care costs among vulnerable groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study was one of the first to examine out‐of‐pocket costs and financial toxicity up to 1 year after breast cancer surgery. Younger age, Black race, race other than Black or White, and lower socioeconomic status were associated with higher financial toxicity. Findings highlight the importance of addressing patients’ financial toxicity in several ways, particularly for groups vulnerable to its effects.","Politi, Mary C.; Yen, Renata W.; Elwyn, Glyn; O'Malley, A.

15263,"Undertaking the mission, innovating courageously, and seeking development",2021-01-07,"Allogenic transplants of the cornea are prone to rejection, especially in repetitive transplantation and in scarred or highly vascularized recipient sites. Patients with these ailments would particularly benefit from the possibility to use non-immunogenic decellularized tissue scaffolds for transplantation, which may be repopulated by host cells in situ or in vitro. So, the aim of this study was to develop a fast and efficient decellularization method for creating a human corneal extracellular matrix scaffold suitable for repopulation with human cells from the corneal limbus. To decellularize human donor corneas, sodium deoxycholate, deoxyribonuclease I, and dextran were assessed to remove cells and nuclei and to control tissue swelling, respectively. We evaluated the decellularization effects on the ultrastructure, optical, mechanical, and biological properties of the human cornea. Scaffold recellularization was studied using primary human limbal epithelial cells, stromal cells, and melanocytes in vitro and a lamellar transplantation approach ex vivo. Our data strongly suggest that this approach allowed the effective removal of cellular and nuclear material in a very short period of time while preserving extracellular matrix proteins, glycosaminoglycans, tissue structure, and optical transmission properties. In vitro recellularization demonstrated good biocompatibility of the decellularized human cornea and ex vivo transplantation revealed complete epithelialization and stromal repopulation from the host tissue. Thus, the generated decellularized human corneal scaffold could be a promising biological material for anterior corneal reconstruction in the treatment of corneal defects.","Polisetti, Naresh; Schmid, Anke; Schlötzer-Schrehardt, Ursula; Maier, Philip; Lang, Stefan J.; Steinberg, Thorsten; Schlunck, Günther; Reinhard, Thomas",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7862698/,250
16436,C-reactive protein/albumin ratio is a prognostic indicator for predicting surgical intervention and mortality in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis,2021-03-29,"Three rod-shaped, Gram-stain-positive, and catalase-positive, phenotypically closely related isolates (HY052(T), HY050, and HY045) were obtained from fecal samples collected from bats in Guangxi province and Chongqing city of China. Circular, smooth, light-yellow colonies appeared on brain heart infusion plate after 24–48 h incubation at 28°C. The optimal pH for growth was between 6.0 and 7.5. Based on 16S rRNA, the three isolates were phylogenetically related to Agromyces terreus DS-10(T), Agromyces aureus AR33(T), Agromyces salentinus 20-5(T), Agromyces allii UMS-62(T), Agromyces lapidis CD55(T), and Agromyces italicus CD1(T). Moreover, based on 296 core genes, the phylogenomic tree indicated that the three isolates clustered together, closest to Agromyces cerinus VKM Ac-1340(T) and Agromyces fucosus VKM Ac-1345(T) but separated distantly from other Agromyces species. The average nucleotide identity values between strain HY052(T) and other Agromyces species ranged from 79.3% to 87.9%, lower than the 95–96% threshold. Furthermore, the genome of strain HY052(T) contains a circular chromosome of 3,437,203 bp with G + C content of 69.0 mol%. Main fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0) and anteiso-C(17:0). The polar lipids comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and unidentified glycolipids. Rhamnose, ribose, and glucose were the primary cell wall sugars. The major peptidoglycan amino acids included alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid. An additional remarkable difference from other Agromyces species is that MK-12 was the sole menaquinone in strain HY052(T). Based on results from the polyphasic characterizations performed in this study, our isolates are proposed to be members of a novel species in genus Agromyces, named Agromyces laixinhei. The type strain is HY052(T) (= CGMCC 1.17175(T) = JCM 33695(T)).

As a result, these devices sell without regulations and warnings about their adverse effects on health, with a growing user base targeting young people. This systematic review aimed to describe the adverse effects on the respiratory system in consumers of these devices. We conducted a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of 79 studies without conflict of interest evaluating ENDS and HTP effects in the respiratory system in experimental models, retrieved from the PubMed database. We found that the damage produced by using these devices is involved in pathways related to pulmonary diseases, involving mechanisms previously reported in conventional cigarettes as well as new mechanisms particular to these devices, which challenges that the tobacco industry’s claims. The present study provides significant evidence to suggest that these devices are an emerging public health problem and that they should be regulated or avoided.","Bravo-Gutiérrez, Omar Andrés; Falfán-Valencia, Ramcés; Ramírez-Venegas, Alejandra; Sansores, Raúl H.; Ponciano-Rodríguez, Guadalupe; Pérez-Rubio, Gloria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070637/,250
18120,Factors influencing speech language pathologists’ and audiologists’ decision to pursue postgraduate studies in South Africa,2021-05-18,"Immunotherapy has become a mainstay of cancer treatment in many malignancies, though its application in breast cancer remains limited. Of the breast cancer subtypes, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by immune activation and infiltration and more commonly express biomarkers associated with response to immunotherapy. Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has shown promising activity in metastatic TNBC. In 2019, the US FDA granted accelerated approval of atezolizumab, a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, in combination with nab-paclitaxel for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic PD-L1-positive TNBC, based on the results of the phase III IMpassion130 trial. In 2020, the FDA also granted accelerated approval of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in combination with chemotherapy for locally recurrent unresectable and metastatic PD-L1-positive TNBC, based on results of the phase III KEYNOTE-355 trial. Additional combination strategies are being explored in the treatment of metastatic TNBC, with the goal of augmenting antitumor activity. In this review, the clinical development of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic TNBC will be discussed, including clinical outcomes with monotherapy and combination therapy regimens, biomarkers that may predict for benefit, and future directions in the field.","Heeke, Arielle L.; Tan, Antoinette R.",Cancer Metastasis Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8184866/,250

METHODS: 86 patients with suspected NEC from 2009 to 2018 were classified as with CHD (n = 18) if they required cardiac intervention versus without CHD (n = 68). Clinical and radiological data were collected, including AXR and AUS concordance. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s exact test were performed. RESULTS: CHD patients had higher birth weights (p < 0.001) and gestational ages (p < 0.001) than non-CHD patients. CHD patients presented more frequently with hypotension (p = 0.041) and less frequently with bilious emesis (p < 0.001). Overall, CHD patients were less likely to have AUS findings of pneumatosis (33.3 vs. 72.1%; p = 0.005) and decreased mural flow (0 vs. 20.6%; p = 0.035) compared to non-CHD patients. On concordance analysis, CHD patients had 3.9-fold more discordant studies with pneumatosis on AXR but not on AUS (33.3 vs. 8.8%; p = 0.016) compared to non-CHD patients. Urgent surgery was required in 5.6% of CHD patients versus 16.2% of non-CHD patients. CONCLUSION: CHD patients with suspected NEC represent a distinct clinical population. AUS has particular utility in assessing findings of bowel viability in the CHD NEC population, reflecting reduced rates of surgical NEC.","Lazow, Stefanie P.; Tracy, Sarah A.; Estroff, Judy A.; Parad, Richard B.; Castro-Aragon, Ilse M.; Fujii, Alan M.; Staffa, Steven J.; Zurakowski, David; Chen, Catherine",Pediatr Surg Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477364/,250
24578,Infectieziekten,2017-06-26,"Successful virus infection of host cells requires efficient viral replication, production of virus progeny and spread of newly synthesized virus particles. This success, however also depends on the evasion of a multitude of antiviral signaling mechanisms. Many viruses are capable of averting antiviral signals through modulation of host cell signaling pathways. Apoptotic inhibition, for example, is a universal intracellular antiviral response, which prolongs cellular survival and allows viruses to complete their life cycle. Ongoing apoptotic inhibition contributes to the establishment of latent and chronic infections, and has been implicated in viral oncogenesis. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway has become recognized as being pivotal to the inhibition of apoptosis and cellular survival. Thus, modulation of this pathway provides viruses with a mechanism whereby they can increase their survival, in addition to other established mechanisms such as expression of viral onco-genes and direct inhibition of proapoptotic proteins. Recent research has revealed that this pathway is up-regulated by a number of viruses during both short-term acute infections and long-term latent or chronic infections. During acute infections PI3K-Akt signaling helps to create an environment favorable for virus replication and virion assembly. In the case of long-term infections, modulation of PI3K-Akt signaling by specific viral products is believed to help create a favorable environment for virus persistence, and contribute to virus-mediated cellular transformation.","Cooray, Samantha","Apoptosis, Cell Signaling, and Human Diseases",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120950/,250

Recently, many state-of-the-art models have been proposed to achieve low-order and high-order feature interactions. However, most of them ignore the importance of cross features and fail to suppress the negative impact of useless features. In this paper, a novel multi-scale feature-crossing attention network (MsFcNET) is proposed to extract dense-and-implicit cross features and learn their importance in the different scales. The model adopts the DIA-LSTM units to construct a new attention calibration architecture, which can adaptively adjust the weights of features in the process of feature interactions. On the other hand, it also integrates a multi-scale feature-crossing module to strengthen the representation ability of cross features from multi-field sparse data. The extensive experimental results on three real-world prediction datasets demonstrate that our proposed model yields superior performance compared with the other state-of-the-art models.","Xie, Zhifeng; Zhang, Wenling; Ding, Huiming; Ma, Lizhuang",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206309/,250

The phasing process is time-consuming and generally exceeds hours even on server-grade computing systems. Loh et al. recently introduced a fast and effective reference-based haplotype phasing software named EAGLE2 which scales linearly with the number of reference samples and variants to phase. We discovered that from the several steps of the EAGLE2 phasing process, data preparation for the internally used HapHedge data structure already consumes about half of the total runtime in general use cases. We addressed this problem by introducing a new design for reconfigurable architectures that accelerates this part of the software by a factor of up to 29 on a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale FPGA, resulting in a total speedup of the complete phasing process of almost 2 (the theoretical limit according to Amdahl’s Law) when compared to a server-grade computing system with two Intel Xeon CPUs. As a result, we reduced the EAGLE2 runtime of genome-wide phasing of 520,000 variants in 2500 samples using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel from 68 min to 39 min on our system while maintaining quality.","Wienbrandt, Lars; Kässens, Jan Christian; Ellinghaus, David",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304045/,250

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate. Conclusions: A simple data-driven approach using available global information before the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed able to classify countries in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The model was not able to stratify countries based on COVID-19 mortality data.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M.; Castillo-Cara, Manuel",Wellcome Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308996/,250

We prepared two datasets of nondominated solutions due to two problem definitions, which differ merely in the definition of some design variables based on a design hypothesis gained from evolutionary-computation results. This study aims at verifying the hypothesis by applying mining to these two datasets to elucidate the contrast in the influence of the design variables. We used functional analysis of variance for data mining; scrutinized the effects of single and two-combined design variables. Furthermore, intuitive visualization by triangular matrix representations could distinguish the discrepancy between the obtained results. The consequence has verified the significance of the hypothesis; it revealed that the discontinuous surface naturally evaded in the hypersonic range because of surface temperature upsurge is capable of enhancing the lift-to-drag ratio in the low-speed range; the hypothesis grew into a new design problem.","Chiba, Kazuhisa; Hatta, Taiki; Kanazaki, Masahiro",Data Mining and Big Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351688/,250
36757,"COVID‐19 and Management Education: Reflections on Challenges, Opportunities, and Potential Futures",2020-07-09,"One of the main concerns with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is to increase or maintain diversity during search in order to avoid premature convergence. In this study, a Performance Class-Based learning PSO (PCB-PSO) algorithm is proposed, that not only increases and maintains swarm diversity but also improves exploration and exploitation while speeding up convergence simultaneously. In the PCB-PSO algorithm, each particle belongs to a class based on its fitness value and particles might change classes at evolutionary stages or search step based on their updated position. The particles are divided into an upper, middle and lower. In the upper class are particles with top fitness values, the middle are those with average while particles in the bottom class are the worst performing in the swarm. The number of particles in each group is predetermined. Each class has a unique learning strategy designed specifically for a given task. The upper class is designed to converge towards the best solution found, Middle class particles exploit the search space while lower class particles explore. The algorithm’s strength is its flexibility and robustness as the population of each class allows us to prioritize a desired swarm behavior. The Algorithm is tested on a set of 8 benchmark functions which have generally proven to be difficult to optimize. The algorithm is able to be on par with some cutting edge PSO variants and outperforms other swarm and evolutionary algorithms on a number of functions. On complex multimodal functions, it is able to outperform other PSO variants showing its ability to escape local optima solutions.","Tungom, Chia Emmanuel; Gulan, Maja; Niu, Ben",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354807/,250

What has not been well understood is the impact COVID-19 is having on the economic well-being of Latino families. Using the Abriendo Puertas/Latino Decisions National Parent Survey (1195), we asked Latino respondents how the pandemic has impacted their employment, savings, and finances and we also asked them how they have been coping to make ends meet. Using descriptive analysis and ordinal least squares regression, we find that Latinos are experiencing high job loss and business closures. We also find that young parents (18–29-year olds) and those with income levels of $25,000 or lower are experiencing the most economic stress. We also find that Latinos are having difficulty making housing payments and postponing educational and health-related services to make ends meet. We also find that just over half of Latinos have emergency savings under $1000 which is important given that unemployment benefits expired on July 31, 2020. In conclusion, this research finds that Latinos are experiencing economic stressors and are engaging in coping strategies that are deeply concerning and which require explicit attention from policymakers. Given that Latinos took the longest to recover from the Great Recession, policymakers should keep this in mind as we continue to monitor the implications of the recession, ideally looking at mechanisms to reduce the stress for Latino families and encourage policies which target low-income working class Americans and small business owners.","Vargas, Edward D.; Sanchez, Gabriel R.",J Econ Race Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7653215/,250

We hereby present a case of a female with COVID-19 infection whose hospital course was complicated by colonic pseudo-obstruction caused by pseudomembranous colitis resulting in an emergent hemicolectomy. METHODS: A 59-Year-old female with history of hypertension, diabetes, and breast cancer post mastectomy presented with pneumonia and was confirmed to be COVID-19 positive. She was admitted to the hospital and was treated with Azithromycin for 6 days. Patient developed constipation on day six of hospitalization and started having abdominal pain on day eight with elevated WBC count. Imaging showed distension of cecum and proximal colon. She underwent exploratory laparotomy which revealed a necrotic appearing cecum that was massively dilated and had a serosal tear. These findings prompted emergent hemicolectomy with loop ileostomy. Grossly cecum was black/green, dilated, thin walled with a 5 x 5 cm yellow green raised plaques. Microscopy of the plaques revealed focal erosion of colonic mucosa with overlying acute inflammatory cells, fibrin deposits, mucus, and necrotic epithelial cells consistent with pseudomembranous colitis. CONCLUSION: Review of literature shows no reported cases of intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to pseudomembranous colitis in a COVID-19 patient. Not only this, but there are also only a limited number of case studies of pseudomembranous colitis presenting as intestinal pseudo-obstruction without diarrhea. Though this patient’s presentation could be from Clostridium difficile infection secondary to Azithromycin, it is not a common antibiotic to cause this. Also, one of the known causes of pseudomembranous colitis is ischemia. Given that COVID-19 infection is a pro-thrombotic condition, possible ischemia secondary to COVID-19 infection related coagulopathy should also be a consideration.","Jabbar, A; Rana, T; Ilyas, G; Baqir, A; Emechebe, D; Agaronov, M",Am J Clin Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665280/,250

The air pollution level of the city directly influences the air temperature and also land surface temperature (LST). In this paper, authors analyzed the impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic on the pollution level of the city and resulted LST. Single channel algorithm has been used to retrieve LST from Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite data. Pre-lockdown and post-lockdown satellite data has been used to show the changes in LST due to lockdown. The air quality index of pre-lockdown and post-lockdown period of the city estimated based on seven pollutants such as PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), NH(3), SO(2), CO and Ozone. The pollution level of the city and LST significantly decreased after lockdown is enforced. The pollution level of the major portion of the city before lockdown is moderately polluted (95–153 µm) and after lockdown the satisfactory level of pollution level observed (33–45 µm). The mean LST before lockdown is 28.76 °C (13 March, 2020) and it decreased down to 26.56 °C after lockdown (30 April, 2020).

Transformations of Indian industry, World War II, the post-war crisis and postcolonial economic planning then created conditions for legislation.

With possible ICU readmissions coinciding with a second wave of the pandemic, researchers and clinicians at the University of Michigan sought to develop a patient and caregiver-informed intervention that was remote, accessible, and could be immediately delivered. The resulting study, Health Enhanced by Adjusting and Recovering Together, reinforces these imperatives common in action research frameworks. Action research, emerging itself from a tumultuous time (1930s-40s) paralleling the COVID-19 pandemic, is a pragmatic research approach with the explicit goal of resolving a community problem or enacting social change--and doing so quickly. Here, we demonstrate a unique method for rapid intervention development that intertwines elements of (a) Human-centered design, for the purpose of a people-focused outlook, (b) Action research, for the purpose of rapid intervention, and (c) Traditional qualitative analysis, for the purpose of knowledge creation. The result of this combined method is an efficiently developed intervention that, while imperfect, is a user-centered, contextually-relevant viable product that can be quickly disseminated, tested, and further refined. The method presented is timely and relevant to other clinical and research teams addressing caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Leonard, Natalie; Carmichael, Alicia; Jackson, Jeannette; Huang, Linde; Doshi, Aalap; Leggett, Amanda; Robinson-Lane, Sheria; Gonzalez, Richard",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742103/,250

This English-language survey assessed: sociodemographics; reactions to COVID19; changes in CG responsibilities and abilities; depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-2); CG burden (Zarit Burden Inventory, ZBI-4); and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD-2). Univariate analyses determined the proportion of those who screened positive on PHQ-2 (cutoff=3), GAD-2 (cutoff=3), and ZBI-4 (cutoff=8).

45780,How Americans used their COVID‐19 economic impact payments,2021-01-06,"pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration are important parameters in water quality surveillance and treatment. The changes of these parameters are associated with electron density in water. Several techniques including electrolysis and catalysis which require redox reactions and electron exchange are employed to improve these parameters. In recent years, studies reported that magnetic effects can impart considerable changes on the pH, ORP and DO concentration of water. However, the correlation between electron density and magnetic effects on these parameters has yet to be disclosed despite the fact that increased electron density in water could improve water’s reductive properties, heat capacity and hydrogen bonding characteristics. In this study, the magnetic effects on pH, ORP and DO concentration were investigated using different magnets arrangements and water flow rates based on reversed electric motor principle. Results showed that the improvement of pH, ORP and DO concentration from 5.40–5.42 to 5.58–5.62 (+ 3.5%), 392 to 365 mV (− 6.9%), and 7.30 to 7.71 mg L(− 1) (+ 5.6%), respectively were achieved using combined variables of non-reversed polarity magnet arrangement (1000–1500 G magnetic strength) and water flow rate of 0.1–0.5 mL s(− 1). Such decrement in ORP value also corresponded to 8.0 × 10(13) number of electron generation in water. Furthermore, Raman analysis revealed that magnetic effect could strengthen the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of water molecules and favor formation of smaller water clusters. The findings of this study could contribute to potential applications in aquaculture, water quality control and treatment of cancer attributed to free radical induced-oxidative stress.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the ability of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) to predict the risk of 7-day mortality, and to test a machine learning algorithm which combines the SAPS II with additional patients’ characteristics at ICU admission. We used data from the “Italian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance in Intensive Care Units” network. Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm was used to classify 3782 patients according to sex, patient’s origin, type of ICU admission, non-surgical treatment for acute coronary disease, surgical intervention, SAPS II, presence of invasive devices, trauma, impaired immunity, antibiotic therapy and onset of HAI. The accuracy of SAPS II for predicting patients who died from those who did not was 69.3%, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.678. Using the SVM algorithm, instead, we achieved an accuracy of 83.5% and AUC of 0.896. Notably, SAPS II was the variable that weighted more on the model and its removal resulted in an AUC of 0.653 and an accuracy of 68.4%. Overall, these findings suggest the present SVM model as a useful tool to early predict patients at higher risk of death at ICU admission.","Barchitta, Martina; Maugeri, Andrea; Favara, Giuliana; Riela, Paolo Marco; Gallo, Giovanni; Mura, Ida; Agodi, Antonella",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957866/,250

In this work we propose a parametric cubic Hermite (CH) based mesh to model the shape of cow udders and teats. The workflow starts from selecting a subset of nodes from the data cloud captured by a depth scanner, and constructing a CH mesh from the nodes. Using a coherent point drifting (CPD) algorithm, the nodes on the mesh are registered from one cow to their counterparts of another cow while preserving the topological coherence of the mesh. This workflow works well for the udder surface when teats are excluded. However, when teats are included in the mesh, misaligned correspondences occur due to data point occlusion and insufficient sampling points. In summary, a first parametric mesh based 3D model has been constructed for the cow udder and teat. We have examined the efficacy of the morphing algorithm, and also the issues to be solved for a statistical cow udder and teat model.","Ho, Harvey; Nordbø, Øyind",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971832/,250

Menjívar and Gómez Cervantes explore three aspects of the US immigration bureaucracy: legislation, enforcement, and judicial spaces, as these contribute to the legal exclusion of certain migrants leading to their physical displacement within the US (through detention) and outside the country (through deportation). Displacement begins before entry, as some groups are not even allowed in and new immigration categories make it nearly impossible to enter. Immigration enforcement criminalises Latinos/as and Muslims, promoting their physical displacement. Judicial decisions separate families while placing immigrants in detention and deportation. Ultimately, the immigration bureaucracy spills over, with economic, emotional, and physical consequences for the well-being of immigrants, their families, and communities.","Menjívar, Cecilia; Gómez Cervantes, Andrea",The Handbook of Displacement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972040/,250

The global financial market, which has been significantly affected by the pandemic, is no exception. Many scientists and financiers around the world compare the current situation with the great depression and the consequences of World War II. The world is just beginning to calculate the real losses from the coronavirus epidemic. Most national economies forecast a severe recession in 2020, with global losses of about 3%. With a decrease in macroeconomic indicators, the stock market during the active phase of the pandemic shows growth. The specificity of stock markets is that they are not a mirror image of the state of the economy: index peaks usually occur just before the start of a recession, and index growth is usually an advance process that begins before economic growth begins. The article raises topical issues of COVID-19’s influence on global financial markets. The aim of this article is to review the dynamics of the main stock market indices, determine the reasons for the deterioration of economic development with the application of the world’s best management practices, and evaluate the measures of financial regulators for the growth of the financial market. The methodological tools of this research are General and particular research methods, methods and tools for graphical interpretation, comparative analysis, and related changes. The article gives a theoretical overview of the research of the problem, retrospective analysis of the impact of a pandemic on financial markets, examines the major stock market indices and forecasts for the global economy, the monetary actions of Central banks to stabilize the economic situation.","Korostelkina, Irina; Varaksa, Natalia; Korostelkin, Mikhail; Vasilyeva, Marina",Comprehensible Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972532/,250

48769,Is COVID-19 a Crime? A Criminological Perspective,2021-03-20,"This last chapter of Revealing Creativity presents takeaways from the exploration of dynamic creativity in postsecondary education wherein a creativity framework was adapted to uncover perspectives in accountability-bound world cultures. A chief precept is that existing models of creativity—like the Four C Model of Creativity—can be utilized to help inform, interpret, and probe ideas of creativity in and across (testing) cultures. Another salient belief is that creativity can be understood as a (dynamic) process, and approached and studied as such. Dynamic creative processes have been demonstrated with the 4-C creative intervention and results described as Experience, Express, and Enliven Creativity (E(3)C) from educational settings in China, Canada, and Australia. A summary of this original concept and potential implications of it for theory, research, and practice are included. Hidden-c creativity, also a new concept of mine that was introduced, is the potential to be discovered in all contexts and places of learning under duress, another key takeaway. In the journey that became this book, three global influences affected the 4-C program: creativity crisis, curriculum shortfalls, and creativity constraints. Counterforces—creativity process, dynamic adaptation, and creative exploration—also shaped the research and outcomes. These forces and counterforces are described, with references to the literature and research conducted. Readers might find it helpful to be aware of these influences within learning environments amid unexpected institutional and world fluxes. The enrichment of theory, research, and practice that comes from creative discovery is anticipated for future frontiers of creativity.","Mullen, Carol A.",Revealing Creativity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978654/,250

The authors outline some of the challenging historical , cultural , economic , environmental , social, and political conditions of our contemporary times. These are also challenges for education, which must be renewed to confront the challenges of our time. The authors use the theory of education outlined at the beginning of the chapter as a critical framework for finding ways to resist the bureaucratising and deprofessionalising tendencies of education systems locally, nationally, and globally, and to restore hope for forms of contemporary educational practice that can help people to live well in worlds worth living in—and for the practice architectures (conditions of possibility) that make critical educational praxis possible. The authors show that the work of the Pedagogy, Education, and Praxis (PEP) international research network in the years 2008–2018 has included a variety of kinds of research that have contributed to the realisation of educational praxis—research by educators, research with educators, and research for educators. The chapter concludes by encouraging resilience and resistance in the face of an intensely pressurised system of education dominated by performativity , management, and surveillance in our neoliberal times, and resources for a journey of hope in the task of realising education in the form of educational practices that in fact help children, young people, and adults to live well in a world worth living in.","Petrie, Kirsten; Kemmis, Stephen; Edwards-Groves, Christine","Pedagogy, Education, and Praxis in Critical Times",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978684/,250

The introduction of industrial symbiosis scenario in which one firm’s waste becomes another firm’s feedstock represents a further development of eco-industrial parks design. This principle may be extended to cities and, doing so, an integration of socio-economic and ecological systems will be promoted. At the industrial park level, the practice of the circular transformation through waste exchange enhances circular economy.

The paper provides a comprehensive survey on healthcare scheduling focuses on the recent literature. The development of healthcare scheduling research plays a critical role in optimizing costs and improving the patient flow, providing prompt administration of treatment, and the optimal use of the resources provided and accessible in the hospitals. In the last decades, the healthcare scheduling methods that aim to automate the search for optimal resource management in hospitals by using metaheuristics methods have proliferated. However, the reported results are disintegrated since they solved every specific problem independently, given that there are many versions of problem definition and various data sets available for each of these problems. Therefore, this paper integrates the existing results by performing a comprehensive review and analyzing 190 articles based on four essential components in solving optimization problems: problem definition, formulations, data sets, and methods. This paper summarizes the latest healthcare scheduling problems focusing on patients’ admission scheduling problems, nurse scheduling problems, and operation room scheduling problems considering these are the most common issues found in the literature.

Despite sustained efforts, the factors that affect PRRSV replication in host cells are far from being fully elucidated and thus warrants further investigation. In this study, we first demonstrated that PRRSV infection can cause downregulation of endogenous p21 protein in MARC-145 cells in a virus dose-dependent manner. Next, we analyzed the effect of p21 knockdown by RNA interference on cell cycle progression using flow cytometric analysis, and found that knockdown of p21 promotes MARC-145 cells entry into S phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, we further discovered PRRSV infection is also able to promote MARC-145 cells entry into the S phase. Subsequently, we synchronized MARC-145 cells into G0/G1, S and G2/M phases, respectively, and then determined PRRSV replication in these cells. Results here show that the MARC-145 cells synchronized into the S phase exhibited the highest viral titer among the cells synchronized to different phases. Additionally, to reliably analyze the potential role of endogenous p21 protein in PRRSV replication, we constructed a p21 gene-knockout MARC-145 cell line (p21(−/−)) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and evaluated its capability to support PRRSV replication. Our results indicate that knockout of p21 is conducive to PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Furthermore, through construction of a series of eukaryotic plasmids expressing each of individual PRRSV proteins combined with cell transfection, we demonstrated that the nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) of PRRSV mediates p21 degradation, which was further confirmed by generating a stable MARC-145 cell line constitutively expressing nsp11 using a lentivirus system. Notably, we further demonstrated that the endoribonuclease activity rather than the deubiquitinating activity of nsp11 is essential for p21 degradation via mutagenic analysis. Finally, we demonstrated that nsp11 mediates p21 degradation via a ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation manner. Altogether, our study not only uncovers a new pathogenesis of PRRSV, but also provides new insights into development of novel antiviral strategies.","Wen, Xuexia; Ge, Xinna; Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Yongning; Guo, Xin; Yang, Hanchun",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044838/,250

A hospital-based training programme was rapidly arranged to prepare staff for the imminent threat. OBJECTIVE: We developed a hospital-wide multidisciplinary infection control training programme on endotracheal intubation for healthcare workers to minimise nosocomial spread of COVID-19 during this high-stress and time-sensitive risky procedure. METHODOLOGY: Major stakeholders (Quality & Safety Department, Infection Control Team, Central Nursing Division, high-risk clinical departments and hospital training centre) formed a training programme task group. This group was tasked with developing high-fidelity scenario-based simulation training curriculum for COVID-19 endotracheal intubation with standard workflow and infection control practice. This group then implemented and evaluated the training programme for its effectiveness. RESULTS: 101 training classes of 2-hour session were conducted from 5 February to 18 March 2020, involving 1415 hospital staff (~81% of target participants with training needs) either inside the hospital training centre or as in situ simulation training (intensive care unit or accident and emergency department). Learners’ satisfaction was reflected by overall positive response percentage at 90%. Opinions of participating staff were incorporated into the standard airway management and infection control practice for endotracheal intubation of adult patients with COVID-19. Thirty-five patients with COVID-19 were intubated with the current workflow and guideline without any nosocomial transmission. CONCLUSION: An early planned and well-structured multidisciplinary hospital-wide simulation training programme was organised expeditiously to provide extensive staff coverage. The insight and experience gained from this project is valuable for future infectious disease challenges.","So, Eric H K; Chia, N H; Ng, George W Y; Chan, Osburga P K; Yuen, S L; Lung, David C; Li, W C; So, S S; Cheung, Victor K L",BMJ Simul Technol Enhanc Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8154296/,250

54148,Remaining Human in COVID-19: Dialogues on Psychogeography,2021-06-11,"OBJECTIVES: The Mediterranean diet is associated with many health benefits, yet it is typically only the food pattern that is assessed without consideration for lifestyle attributes that accompany a Mediterranean way of life. The Mediterranean diet pyramid includes lifestyle activities at the base of the pyramid such as regular physical activity (PA), adequate rest, conviviality, biodiversity and seasonality, traditional local and eco-friendly products, and culinary activities. The purpose of this study was to design and pilot test a Mediterranean diet and lifestyle index for older adults in the U.S. METHODS: The Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to determine the alternative Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed). The short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time PA questionnaire and additional Mediterranean diet-related dietary habit and lifestyle questions were piloted in 75 older adults attending senior centers. RESULTS: Participants were primarily women (80.6%) and Caucasian (68%) with an average age of 71.89+/−7.60 years. A 27-item index including the aMed food groups, dietary habits, PA, culinary activities, purchasing of local and seasonal foods, and adequate rest resulted in a reliable score (α = 0.75). Individual index factors correlated with the overall Mediterranean diet and lifestyle score. CONCLUSIONS: While this Mediterranean diet and lifestyle index resulted in good internal consistency; assessment of conviviality, especially for older adults in the time of Covid-19, need be re-evaluated as a lifestyle measure that can impact dietary intake and overall health.

In this study, we assessed food security, perceived impacts of C19 and coping mechanisms to deal with these impacts. METHODS: As part of a baseline survey for an evaluation of the World Food Programme's Nutrition-Sensitive Food Assistance for Assets Program in Sri Lanka, we conducted ∼1300 quantitative household phone surveys across five districts between December 2020 and February 2021. Food insecurity was assessed using the 8-item Food Insecurity Experience Scale and categorized as moderate or severe using the Rasch model. Perceived impacts of C19 and the coping mechanisms used to deal with these shocks were assessed via questionnaire. Additionally, we explored how these experiences varied by wealth quintile, highest attained education level in the household, and district. RESULTS: Despite having had a relatively low burden of C19 cases in Sri Lanka compared to other countries, 85% of respondents in our sample reported being affected in some way by C19 or its associated control measures. Reported impacts include those on income (77% overall, 89% in lowest quintile, 62% in highest quintile) and agriculture activities (76% overall, 65% in lowest quintile, 87% in highest quintile), among others. Normal crop cultivation and harvesting was adversely impacted due to being advised to stay home (42%), being unable to purchase inputs (33%) and poor demand in the market (56%). In response to COVID shocks, about 30% of respondents in the lowest two wealth quintiles reported selling their livestock and about 20% of respondents across all wealth quintiles reported selling other assets. Half of the households interviewed were either moderately (36%) or severely (14%) food insecure. The proportion of households experiencing food insecurity varied by wealth quintile (mod: 55%-21%; sev: 27%-5%) and district (mod: 46%-29%; sev: 21%-10%). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of food insecurity and disruptions across domains such as income, asset ownership, and agriculture could have short- and long-term effects on people's health, nutrition and well-being. Control measures enacted in Sri Lanka should consider the potentially devastating effects on smallholder farmers and introduce measures to mitigate these issues in those most affected.

54950,Playbook for Labour Policies for Novel Shocks Such as COVID-19,2020-08-01,"Cancelling the Ant Group Initial Public Offering on short notice in November 2020 attracted attention on the international financial markets. Ant Group is the subsidiary of a large Chinese technology corporation that specialises in financial services. A regulation change that classifies Ant Group as a financial holding company and which aims to curb the systemic risk of its business activities shows how the Chinese authorities limit the large technology corporations’ market power and thereby introduce a stricter regulation of the shadow banking sector. Can this approach to regulate the Chinese shadow banking sector serve as a model for the European Union? This paper first discusses the development of the shadow banking sector, its relevance for global financial stability, and current challenges for its regulation. Then, based on a case study of Ant Group, this paper discusses opportunities and challenges of the Chinese authorities’ regulatory approach and derives implications for the regulation in Europe. In summary, a regulation of large technology corporations that offer a large range of financial services comparable to traditional banks seems necessary with reference to financial stability, as these companies (potentially) have extensive market power.","Böhnke, Victoria",List Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8222956/,250

55399,Recalibrating Management Research for the Post‐COVID‐19 Scientific Enterprise,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Frog Virus 3 (FV3) is a large dsDNA virus belonging to Ranaviruses of family Iridoviridae. Ranaviruses infect cold-blood vertebrates including amphibians, fish and reptiles, and contribute to catastrophic amphibian declines. FV3 has a genome at ~105 kb that contains nearly 100 coding genes and 50 intergenic regions as annotated in its reference genome. Previous studies have mainly focused on coding genes and rarely addressed potential non-coding regulatory role of intergenic regions. RESULTS: Using a whole transcriptomic analysis of total RNA samples containing both the viral and cellular transcripts from FV3-infected frog tissues, we detected virus-specific reads mapping in non-coding intergenic regions, in addition to reads from coding genes. Further analyses identified multiple cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in intergenic regions neighboring highly transcribed coding genes. These CREs include not only a virus TATA-Box present in FV3 core promoters as in eukaryotic genes, but also viral mimics of CREs interacting with several transcription factors including CEBPs, CREBs, IRFs, NF-κB, and STATs, which are critical for regulation of cellular immunity and cytokine responses. Our study suggests that intergenic regions immediately upstream of highly expressed FV3 genes have evolved to bind IRFs, NF-κB, and STATs more efficiently. Moreover, we found an enrichment of putative microRNA (miRNA) sequences in more than five intergenic regions of the FV3 genome. Our sequence analysis indicates that a fraction of these viral miRNAs is targeting the 3’-UTR regions of Xenopus genes involved in interferon (IFN)-dependent responses, including particularly those encoding IFN receptor subunits and IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs). CONCLUSIONS: Using the FV3 model, this study provides a first genome-wide analysis of non-coding regulatory mechanisms adopted by ranaviruses to epigenetically regulate both viral and host gene expressions, which have co-evolved to interact especially with the host IFN response.","Tian, Yun; Khwatenge, Collins N.; Li, Jiuyi; De Jesus Andino, Francisco; Robert, Jacques; Sang, Yongming",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248673/,250
55583,Never let a good crisis go to waste: Pauline Hanson’s exploitation of COVID-19 on Facebook,2021-02-11,"Consumer-driven sharing and creation activities are valuable engagement activities as they help spread awareness and interaction for brands on social media. Loyal fans of brand pages are an important audience for brand-related social media engagement, as they are more likely to recommend and advocate for brands. However, little is known about what motivates loyal fans to engage in these valuable activities. This study takes a novel approach by examining self-expansion as a driver that prompts loyal fans to action. When brands offer self-expansive opportunities on their pages, in the form of new knowledge, new perspectives (e.g., awareness on social issues) and exciting experiences, fans may incorporate these in their sense of self (self-page inclusion) and reciprocate by investing their own resources to brand pages. A survey was conducted with 238 millennial users who have a favorite brand page on Instagram. The findings show that the more fans gain opportunities for self-expansion from their favorite pages, the more likely they are to share and create brand-related content. Brand page flow and self-page inclusion are also important drivers. Further, specific page experiences are identified that may enhance the effects of these drivers. Managerial implications are included on how to apply these findings to social media content strategy.","Nikolinakou, Angeliki; Phua, Joe; Kwon, Eun Sook",J Brand Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254630/,250
56192,Assessing the impact of case mobility: issues and recommendations from Greece,2021-07-26,"People who either use an upper limb prosthesis and/or have used services provided by a prosthetic rehabilitation centre, experience limitations of currently available prosthetic devices. Collaboration between academia and a broad range of stakeholders, can lead to the development of solutions that address peoples' needs. By doing so, the rate of prosthetic device abandonment can decrease. Co-creation is an approach that can enable collaboration of this nature to occur throughout the research process. We present findings of a co-creation project that gained user perspectives from a user survey, and a subsequent workshop involving: people who use an upper limb prosthesis and/or have experienced care services (users), academics, industry experts, charity executives, and clinicians. The survey invited users to prioritise six themes, which academia, clinicians, and industry should focus on over the next decade. The prioritisation of the themes concluded in the following order, with the first as the most important: function, psychology, aesthetics, clinical service, collaboration, and media. Within five multi-stakeholder groups, the workshop participants discussed challenges and collaborative opportunities for each theme. Workshop groups prioritised the themes based on their discussions, to highlight opportunities for further development. Two groups chose function, one group chose clinical service, one group chose collaboration, and another group chose media. The identified opportunities are presented within the context of the prioritised themes, including the importance of transparent information flow between all stakeholders; user involvement throughout research studies; and routes to informing healthcare policy through collaboration. As the field of upper limb prosthetics moves toward in-home research, we present co-creation as an approach that can facilitate user involvement throughout the duration of such studies.","Jones, Hannah; Dupan, Sigrid; Dyson, Matthew; Krasoulis, Agamemnon; Kenney, Laurence P.

57303,Nach COVID-19: Kommt jetzt das Impfen gegen Krebs?,2021-07-12,"STUDY QUESTION: The aim was to assess the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety and the moderating factors influencing mental symptoms during the COVID–19 pandemic. SUMMARY ANSWER: Endometriosis patients were at risk of developing mental disorders during the pandemic. Associated risk factors were: reduction of the social network and the employment status. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Endometriosis is a disease affecting up to 10% of women of fertile age. The leading symptoms are sub- or infertility and chronic pain. Additionally, the psychological impact on womeńs life is enormous. Women with endometriosis show higher rates of depression, anxiety and emotional distress, and these alterations in mental health were associated with the presence of pain rather than with the diagnosis of endometriosis. Additionally, a higher level of depression was observed in women with endometriosis. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To assess the impact of the government-imposed social distancing or quarantine on mental health, an online questionnaire was placed on internet platforms of endometriosis patients support groups between 6th and 27th April 2020. Data collection and analysis were performed anonymously. Recruitment was conducted via a direct link to the survey and an invitation to participate was distributed via the internet platforms of patients support groups. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: 274 participants answered the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ–4), which screens for depression (PHQ–2), anxiety (GAD–2) and the level of psychological distress (PHQ–4). PHQ–2 and GAD–2 scores ≥ 3 are cut-off points between normal range and probable cases of mental disorders. A PHQ–4 score above 6 is indicative for severe symptoms. We used descriptive statistics to describe the study population. Correlates of depression and anxiety were identified using multivariate logistic regressions. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We showed that depression and anxiety were highly prevalent in endometriosis patients during the pandemic: 46.7% and 48.2% of participants showed scale scores of ≥ 3 on the PHQ–2 and GAD–2 scales, respectively. The mean PHQ–4 score was 5.72 (SD = 3.21), thus endometriosis patients were achieving significantly higher PHQ–4 sores (p < 0.001) than participants of a previously published study of the representative German population. Risk factors for higher probability of depressive disorders were the employment status (being employed, OR 2.890, p < 0.001), an important or severe reduction of the social network (OR 2.02, p < 0.05), having continuous pain (OR 1.83, p < 0.05) and high level of dysmenorrhea prior to the pandemic (OR 2.106, p < 0.05). Risk factors for higher probability of anxiety were the employment status (being employed, OR 2.697, p < 0.001), an important or severe reduction of the social network (OR 3.038, p < 0.01), and high level of dysmenorrhea prior to the pandemic (OR 1.750, p < 0.05). Endometriosis patients were at higher risk for developing mental health problems. The effective use of brief screening measures, such as PHQ–4, can be widely implemented even in the busy outpatient care of general practitioners and gynecologists and may help to reduce morbidity. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We used self-reports for assessment of anxiety and depression and those are susceptible to response bias, such as giving socially desirable responses. Moreover, as PHQ–4 is only a screening tool, the diagnosis must be confirmed in accordance to the appropriate DSM–V criteria. Wider implications of the findings: A better understanding of potential mental problems in endometriosis patients during stressful events, such as the COVID–19 pandemic or other comparable difficult environmental or social circumstances, is crucial for providing an optimal patient centered care in cases of upcoming stressful events.

The first purpose is to validate a newly developed instrument, the Metacognitive Academic Writing Strategies Questionnaire (MAWSQ), which represents the multifaceted structure of metacognition in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) academic writing setting. The second purpose is to delineate the predictive effects of different metacognitive strategies on EFL academic writing performance. Data were collected from 664 students at a university in mainland China. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) provided evidence for the fit for two hypothesized models, i.e., an eight-factor correlated model and a one-factor second-order model. Model comparisons documented that the one-factor second-order model was a better model, through which metacognition functions as a higher order construct that can account for the correlations of the eight metacognitive strategies, pertaining to declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, conditional knowledge, planning, monitoring, evaluating, information management, and debugging strategies. Results also provided evidence for the significant predicting effects of the eight strategies on EFL academic writing performance. The empirical evidence supports the transfer of metacognition theory from educational psychology to interpreting EFL academic writing.

Recent studies suggest that dietary supplement may improve CGS, but inconsistent results exist. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of a polyherbal-based supplement ColonVita on the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) in 100 old adults with CGS (63.1 ± 9.6 years) who were randomly assigned to daily ColonVita or placebo tablets (n = 50/group) for 12 weeks in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial design. No significant fibrdifferences were found between ColonVita and placebo in the baseline total GIQLI score (101.12 ± 16.87 vs. 101.80 ± 16.48) (P > 0.05) or postintervention total GIQLI score (114.78 ± 9.62 vs. 111.74 ± 13.01) (P > 0.05). However, ColonVita significantly improved 16 scores of the 19 core GI symptoms compared with 10 items improved by placebo. The ColonVita group significantly improved the remission rate of 5 core GI symptoms compared to placebo and significantly improved the total GIQLI scores (118.09 ± 7.88 vs. 109.50 ± 16.71) (P < 0.05) and core GI symptom scores (64.61 ± 3.99 vs. 60.00 ± 8.65) (P < 0.05) in people ≥60 years of age (n = 49) but not in those under 60 y (n = 51). ColonVita significantly improved the total GIQLI scores and core GI symptom scores in people without cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (n = 56) (116.74 ± 9.38 vs. 110.10 ± 14.28) (P < 0.05) and (63.11 ± 4.53 vs. 59.93 ± 8.03) (P=0.07), respectively, but not in those with CVD (n = 44). Thus, ColonVita was beneficial for old adults with CGS, especially those ≥60 years of age and without CVD. Because a heterogenous pathogenesis of CGS-like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (ISD) is differentially associated with CVD, different comorbidities may have influenced the outcomes of different trials that should be controlled in further studies.","Xu, Gang; Xing, Guoqiang; Zhang, Bing; Zhu, Jingfen; Cai, Yong; Shen, Tian; Rao, Jianyu; Shi, Rong; Cao, Zhaochun; Nguyen, Tuong",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8448599/,250

We sought to conduct a meta-analysis comparing asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients to determine the clinical significance of pre-existing asthma in COVID-19 patients. Data Sources: Online databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus, were searched up to July 15, 2020, for papers comparing asthma versus non-asthma COVID-19 patients. Study Selection: According to prespecified inclusion criteria, this analysis included eleven retrospective studies with 107,983 COVID-19 patients. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age groups. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.9 years (95%CI =51.9-67.9). Across studies, the prevalence of asthma was 11.2% (95%CI: 9.1%-13.3%) among COVID-19 patients who attended the hospitals. Asthma patients were more likely to be younger (SMD=-0.36, 95%CI=-0.61 to -0.10, p = 0.005), and obese (OR =1.98, 95%CI =1.54-2.55, p < 0.001), there was no differential risk of hospitalization rate, ICU admission, or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) between asthmatic and non-asthmatic cohorts. However, asthmatic patients had increased risk of endotracheal intubation (RR =1.27, 95%CI =1.02-1.58, p = 0.030) especially patients aged <50 years (RR =6.68, 95%CI =1.76-11.13, p = 0.009). Despite this result, asthmatic patients had better recovery with a higher liability of being discharged and were less likely to die (RR =0.80, 95%CI =0.65-0.97, p = 0.026). Conclusion: To our knowledge, our meta-analysis is the largest to shed light on pre-existing asthma as a predictor of intubation in COVID-19, especially in young and obese patients.

Temperature is a core factor that controls microbial growth, but its impact on the microbiome remains to be fully explored. Although commonly assumed to be a constant 37°C, normal body temperatures vary across the animal kingdom, while individual body temperature is affected by multiple factors, including circadian rhythm, age, environmental temperature stress, and immune activation. Changes in body temperature via hypo- and hyperthermia have been shown to influence the gut microbiota in a variety of animals, with consistent effects on community diversity and stability. It is known that temperature directly modulates the growth and virulence of gastrointestinal pathogens; however, the effect of temperature on gut commensals is not well studied. Further, body temperature can influence other host factors, such as appetite and immunity, with indirect effects on the microbiome.

METHODS Data were taken from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) 2020 Fall COVID-19 Supplement, conducted October-November 2020. Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was measured by respondents' answer to whether they would get a COVID-19 vaccine when available. We classified responses of ""definitely"" and ""probably"" as ""willing to get,"" and responses ""probably not,"" ""definitely not,"" and ""not sure"" as ""vaccine hesitancy."" Reasons for vaccine hesitancy were assessed by a series of yes/no questions focusing on 10 potential reasons. The analytical sample included 6715 adults 65 years and older. We conducted a logistic regression model to assess demographic factors and other factors associated with the willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. All analyses were conducted in Stata 14 and accounted for the complex survey design of MCBS. RESULTS Overall, 61.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.1-63.0) of Medicare beneficiaries would be willing to get a vaccine when available. Among those who were hesitant, more than 40% reported that mistrust of the government and side effects as the main reasons. Logistic regression model results showed that non-Hispanic Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.24-0.44) and Hispanics (AOR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.77) were less willing to get a vaccine than non-Hispanic Whites; beneficiaries with an income of less than $25 000 (AOR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62-0.81) were less willing to get the vaccine than those with an income of $25 000 or more; those who did not think that the COVID-19 virus was more contagious (AOR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.69) or more deadly (AOR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.65) were also less willing to get the vaccine than those who thought that the virus was more contagious or more deadly than the influenza virus. CONCLUSIONS The 2020 MCBS survey data showed that close to 40% of Medicare beneficiaries were hesitant about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, and the hesitancy was greater in racial/ethnic minorities. Medicare beneficiaries were concerned about the safety of the vaccine, and some appeared to be misinformed.

SUMMARY A retrospective chart review of 8 adults on warfarin admitted to Michigan Medicine with COVID-19 infection was conducted and reported as a case series. Outcomes of interest were difference in average daily dose of warfarin prior to admission (PTA) and while inpatient (IP), warfarin sensitivity, time in therapeutic range (TTR), confirmed or suspected thromboembolic event, any major or clinically significant bleeding episodes, and in-hospital mortality. IP average daily warfarin doses were lower when compared to PTA average daily doses [1.3 mg (1.3) vs. 6.2 mg (4.1)]. The mean percentage decrease in dose was 68.8% (23) and the mean absolute dose difference was 4.8 mg (4.3). Mean IP percentage tests in range was 30.8% (24.6) and mean IP warfarin sensitivity was 4.2 (3.8), both of which differed from PTA TTR and warfarin sensitivity for those with data available (n = 3, n = 6, respectively). One patient was treated for suspected acute pulmonary embolism while on warfarin and one patient experienced clinically relevant bleeding. In-hospital mortality was zero, mean length of stay (LOS) was 17 days (14.4), and mean intensive care unit (ICU) LOS for the 3 patients requiring ICU level care was 14.3 days (4.5). CONCLUSION Decreased warfarin dose requirements were evident in this group of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest lower doses of warfarin may be needed to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation while inpatient.","Irwin, Madison N; Adie, Sarah; Sandison, Katherine; Alsomairy, Sarah A; Brancaccio, Adamo",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211000705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719699/,250

The development of intraindividual variability in stopping performance and its underlying neural circuitry has remained largely unstudied, even though understanding variability is of core importance for understanding development. In a total sample of 45 participants (19 children aged 10-12 years and 26 adults aged 18-26 years) of either sex we aimed to identify age-related changes in intraindividual response inhibition performance and its underlying brain signal variability. While there was no difference in average stopping performance between children and adults, stop signal latencies for the children were more variable. Further, brain signal variability during successful stopping was significantly higher in adults compared to children, especially in bilateral thalamus, but also across regions of the inhibition network. Finally, brain signal variability was significantly associated with stopping performance behavioral variability in adults. Together these results indicate that variability in stopping performance decreases, whereas neural variability in the inhibition network increases, from childhood to adulthood. Future work will need to assess whether developmental changes in neural variability drive those in behavioral variability. In sum, both, neural and behavioral variability indices might be a more sensitive measure of developmental differences in response inhibition compared to the standard average-based measurements.","Thompson, Abigail; Schel, Margot A; Steinbeis, Nikolaus",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385547/,250

STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Twenty client-owned dogs. METHODS Dogs requiring medical management of pleural effusion received a BPTT, whereas dogs undergoing postoperative management of pneumothorax and/or pleural fluid after lateral thoracotomy received an FGTT. Time of placement, accuracy of positioning, radiation exposure, and complications were compared between groups. RESULTS Initial placement of BPTT took a mean of 168 seconds (range, 89-197), whereas adequate placement was radiographically confirmed at 20 minutes and 38 seconds (range, 7 minutes and 57 seconds to 39 min). Initial placement of FGTT took a mean time of 108 seconds (range, 50-341, P = .17), and adequate placement was confirmed at 125 seconds (range, 50-341, P < .001). Major errors in placement requiring removal and replacement occurred in 2 dogs for BPTT and in none for FGTT. Procedural complications did not differ between groups, and no postoperative complication occurred within the first 12 hours after placement. Radiation entrance surface dose was lower in the BPTT group (P = .004), but stochastic radiation doses did not differ. CONCLUSION Fluoroscopic guidance of wide-bore thoracostomy tubes accelerated the time to accurate tube placement and alleviated the requirement for removal and replacement in this population. Although use of fluoroscopy increased radiation entrance surface dose, the dose was not clinically significant. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Fluoroscopic guidance of wide-bore thoracostomy tubes should be considered as an alternative to traditional, blind placement.","Barker, David A; Trinterud, Tonje; Demetriou, Jackie L",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.13106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30302761/,250

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 52 electronic medical files of patients (mean age 24.7 years, range 8-59 years) who were treated with thermal ablation of benign osteoid osteomas guided by the navigated O-arm-assisted technique in our institution between 2015 and 2017. Data were extracted on the associated complications, the reduction in pain at 3 months and one year postoperatively, and the amount of radiation administered during the procedure. RESULTS The level of pain on a visual analogue scale decreased from the preoperative average of 7.73 to 0 at the 3-month follow-up. The mean dose-length product was 544.7 mGycm2 compared to the reported radiation exposure of 1971-7946 mGycm2 of CT-guided radio ablations. The one intra-operative complication was a superficial burn in the subcutaneous lesion in a tibia that was treated locally with no major influence on recovery. CONCLUSIONS RFA ablation guided by 3D O-arm stealth navigation is as effective as the traditional CT-guided technique with the advantage of lower radiation exposure.

67276,COVID-19: time for WHO to reconsider its stance towards Taiwan.,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND Mid-frequency ventilation, a strategy of using conventional ventilators at high frequencies, may reduce lung injury but has had limited evaluation in neonates. Hence, a randomized crossover study was designed to assess the feasibility of using mid-frequency ventilation in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS Twelve preterm infants (≥500 g and ≥24 weeks gestational age) who were receiving pressure-limited conventional ventilation with frequencies ≤60 breaths/min for respiratory distress syndrome were randomized to periods of mid-frequency ventilation (conventional ventilation with the fastest frequency up to 150 breaths/min that gave complete inspiration and expiration) or conventional ventilation (frequency ≤60 breaths/min), each lasting 2 h using a crossover design. Ventilator parameters were adjusted to maintain the O2 saturation and transcutaneous CO2 at baseline. RESULTS Mean peak inspiratory pressure (15 ± 4 cm H2O vs 18 ± 4 cm H2O, P < .001), Δ pressure (9.8 ± 3.3 cm H2O vs 13.5 ± 3.9 cm H2O, P < .001), and tidal volume (2.6 ± 0.4 mL/kg vs 4.6 ± 0.8 mL/kg, P < .001) were lower, but mean airway pressure (8.9 ± 1.9 cm H2O vs 8.4 ± 1.6 cm H2O, P = .02) and measured PEEP (5.1 ± 0.5 cm H2O vs 4.4 ± 0.5 cm H2O, P < .001) were higher with mid-frequency compared with conventional ventilation. FIO2, gas exchange, and hemodynamic parameters were not affected. CONCLUSIONS Based on this small study, mid-frequency ventilation among preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome is feasible. Further larger and longer duration trials are necessary to validate our findings.

71542,Research towards treating COVID-19.,2020-04-02,"BACKGROUND Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided anesthesia administration has been reported to reduce the time to tracheal extubation. However, no trials have compared the ability of BIS guidance to promote earlier tracheal extubation relative to guidance by end-tidal anesthetic concentration (ETAC). We hypothesized that BIS-guided anesthesia would result in earlier tracheal extubation compared with ETAC-guided anesthesia in fast-track cardiac surgery patients. METHODS This study consisted of patients at a single institution who were enrolled in the larger, multicenter BIS or Anesthesia Gas to Reduce Explicit Recall (BAG-RECALL) clinical trial that compared rates of postoperative awareness for patient whose anesthetic was guided by BIS versus ETAC. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to BIS (n = 361) or ETAC (n = 362) guided anesthesia. Volatile anesthetic was titrated either to maintain a BIS value of 40 to 60 (BIS group), or an age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration of 0.7 to 1.3 (ETAC group). In the ETAC group, anesthesiologists were blinded to the BIS values. In this substudy, time to tracheal extubation was compared between groups. Cox regression identified predictors affecting the instantaneous probability of tracheal extubation. RESULTS Time to tracheal extubation was not significantly different between groups (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.23, P = 0.643). In addition, group assignment did not influence the instantaneous probability of tracheal extubation (P = 0.433). Predictors decreasing the instantaneous probability of tracheal extubation included higher body mass index (P = 0.001), higher logistic EuroSCORE (P = 0.015), complex surgery type (P = 0.034), and surgery completion in the evening (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Compared with management based on ETAC, anesthetic management based on BIS guidance does not strongly increase the probability of earlier tracheal extubation in patients undergoing fast-track cardiac surgery. The decision to extubate the trachea is more influenced by patient characteristics and perioperative course than the assignment to BIS or ETAC monitoring.","Villafranca, Alexander; Thomson, Ian A; Grocott, Hilary P; Avidan, Michael S; Kahn, Sadia; Jacobsohn, Eric",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31827b117e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23400982/,250

72207,COVID-19 pandemic: changing the way we live and die.,2020-05-02,"Current recommendations for assessing animal wellbeing during euthanasia suggest that measuring neuroendocrine hormones-such as ACTH, noradrenaline, and adrenaline-is preferable to measuring corticosterone and blood glucose because of the sensitivity of neuroendocrine hormones to the acute stress associated with rapid methods of euthanasia. However, theseneuroendocrine hormones can be stimulated in ways that confound interpretation of welfare assessment in euthanasia studies.Although this property does not negate the usefulness of neuroendocrine hormones as tools of assessment, it is importantto differentiate the stress associated with the induction of anesthesia before the loss of consciousness (an animal wellbeingconcern) with the physiologic responses that occur after the loss of consciousness (not an animal wellbeing concern). In thisstudy, rats were anesthetized by using a ketamine-xylazine combination. Once the rats achieved a surgical plane of anesthesia,they were exposed to O2, CO2, or isoflurane, followed by terminal blood collection to assess concentrations of ACTH,noradrenaline, corticosterone, and blood glucose. Compared with animals exposed to O2 or isoflurane, rats exposed to CO2had significant increases in their serum concentrations of ACTH and noradrenaline, but blood glucose and corticosteronedid not differ between groups. These findings indicate that noradrenaline and ACTH should be used with caution to assessanimal wellbeing when the method of euthanasia might confound that assessment.","Hickman, Debra L",Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science : JAALAS,https://doi.org/10.30802/aalas-jaalas-17-000159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30305196/,250
72918,How heuristic credibility cues affect credibility judgments and decisions.,2020-07-13,"UNLABELLED The emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes lethal respiratory infections mainly on the Arabian Peninsula. The evolutionary origins of MERS-CoV are unknown. We determined the full genome sequence of a CoV directly from fecal material obtained from a South African Neoromicia capensis bat (NeoCoV). NeoCoV shared essential details of genome architecture with MERS-CoV. Eighty-five percent of the NeoCoV genome was identical to MERS-CoV at the nucleotide level. Based on taxonomic criteria, NeoCoV and MERS-CoV belonged to one viral species. The presence of a genetically divergent S1 subunit within the NeoCoV spike gene indicated that intraspike recombination events may have been involved in the emergence of MERS-CoV. NeoCoV constitutes a sister taxon of MERS-CoV, placing the MERS-CoV root between a recently described virus from African camels and all other viruses. This suggests a higher level of viral diversity in camels than in humans. Together with serologic evidence for widespread MERS-CoV infection in camelids sampled up to 20 years ago in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the genetic data indicate that camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa. The majority of camels on the Arabian Peninsula is imported from the Greater Horn of Africa, where several Neoromicia species occur. The acquisition of MERS-CoV by camels from bats might have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa. Camelids may represent mixing vessels for MERS-CoV and other mammalian CoVs. IMPORTANCE It is unclear how, when, and where the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV emerged. We characterized the full genome of an African bat virus closely related to MERS-CoV and show that human, camel, and bat viruses belong to the same viral species. The bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of MERS-CoV, providing evidence for an evolution of MERS-CoV in camels that preceded that in humans. The revised tree suggests that humans are infected by camels rather than vice versa. Although MERS-CoV cases occur mainly on the Arabian Peninsula, the data from this study together with serologic and molecular investigations of African camels indicate that the initial host switch from bats may have taken place in Africa. The emergence of MERS-CoV likely involved exchanges of genetic elements between different viral ancestors. These exchanges may have taken place either in bat ancestors or in camels acting as mixing vessels for viruses from different hosts.","Corman, Victor Max; Ithete, Ndapewa Laudika; Richards, Leigh Rosanne; Schoeman, M Corrie; Preiser, Wolfgang; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01498-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25031349/,250

Operative outcome and long-term follow-up of a consecutive cohort of patients who underwent MGB are reported. The data on 1,000 patients who underwent MGB from November 2005 to January 2011 at an academic institution were reviewed. Mean age was 33.15 ± 10.17 years (range, 14-72), preoperative BMI was 42.5 ± 6.3 kg/m(2) (range, 26-75), mean preoperative weight was 121.6 ± 23.8 kg (range, 71-240), and 663 were women. Operative time and length of stay for primary vs. revisional MGB were 89 ± 12.8 min vs. 144 ± 15 min (p < 0.01) and l.85 ± 0.8 day vs. 2.35 ± 1.89 day (p < 0.01). No deaths occurred within 30 days of surgery. Short-term complications occurred in 2.7% for primary vs. 11.6% for revisionnal MGB (p < 0.01). Five (0.5%) patients presented with leakage from the gastric tube but none had anastomotic leakage. Four (0.4%) patients, all with revisional MGB, presented with severe bile reflux and were cured by stapling the afferent loop and by a latero-lateral jejunojejunostomy. Excessive weight loss occurred in four patients; two were reversed and two were converted to sleeve gastrectomy. Maximal percent excess weight loss (EWL) of 72.5% occurred at 18 months. Weight regain subsequently occurred with a mean variation of -3.9% EWL at 60 months. The 50% EWL was achieved for 95% of patients at 18 months and for 89.8% at 60 months.

However, little is known about the clinical characteristics of kidney-related complications, including hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center study in China, we analyzed data from electronic medical records of 333 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including information about clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and other characteristics, as well as information about renal outcomes. RESULTS We found that 251 of the 333 patients (75.4%) had abnormal urine dipstick tests or AKI. Of 198 patients with renal involvement for the median duration of 12 days, 118 (59.6%) experienced remission of pneumonia during this period, and 111 of 162 (68.5%) patients experienced remission of proteinuria. Among 35 patients who developed AKI (with AKI identified by criteria expanded somewhat beyond the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition), 16 (45.7%) experienced complete recovery of kidney function. We suspect that most AKI cases were intrinsic AKI. Patients with renal involvement had higher overall mortality compared with those without renal involvement (28 of 251 [11.2%] versus one of 82 [1.2%], respectively). Stepwise multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed that severity of pneumonia was the risk factor most commonly associated with lower odds of proteinuric or hematuric remission and recovery from AKI. CONCLUSIONS Renal abnormalities occurred in the majority of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI often resolved in such patients within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, renal complications in COVID-19 were associated with higher mortality.","Pei, Guangchang; Zhang, Zhiguo; Peng, Jing; Liu, Liu; Zhang, Chunxiu; Yu, Chong; Ma, Zufu; Huang, Yi; Liu, Wei; Yao, Ying; Zeng, Rui; Xu, Gang",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020030276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345702/,250

METHODS A consecutive series of 246 patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation who underwent endovascular treatment between April 2014 and January 2018 was analyzed. Clinical, conventional imaging (electronic Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, acute ischemic volume, site of vessel occlusion, and collateral score), and advanced imaging characteristics (CT-perfusion with quantification of ischemic penumbra and infarct core volumes) before treatment as well as angiographic (interval groin puncture-recanalization, modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score) and postinterventional clinical (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score after 24 hours) and imaging characteristics (electronic Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, final infarction volume after 18-36 hours) were assessed. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days (mRS-90) was used to measure patient outcome (favorable outcome: mRS-90 ≤2 versus unfavorable outcome: mRS-90 >2). Machine-learning with gradient boosting classifiers was used to assess the performance and relative importance of the extracted characteristics for predicting mRS-90. RESULTS Baseline clinical and conventional imaging characteristics predicted mRS-90 with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.740 (95% CI, 0.733-0.747) and an accuracy of 0.711 (95% CI, 0.705-0.717). Advanced imaging with CT-perfusion did not improved the predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.747 [95% CI, 0.740-0.755]; accuracy, 0.720 [95% CI, 0.714-0.727]; P=0.150). Further inclusion of angiographic and postinterventional characteristics significantly improved the predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.856 [95% CI, 0.850-0.861]; accuracy, 0.804 [95% CI, 0.799-0.810]; P<0.001). The most important parameters for predicting mRS 90 were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score after 24 hours (importance =100%), premorbid mRS score (importance =44%) and final infarction volume on postinterventional CT after 18 to 36 hours (importance =32%). CONCLUSIONS Integrative assessment of clinical, multimodal imaging, and angiographic characteristics with machine-learning allowed to accurately predict the clinical outcome following endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Thereby, premorbid mRS was the most important clinical predictor for mRS-90, and the final infarction volume was the most important imaging predictor, while the extent of hemodynamic impairment on CT-perfusion before treatment had limited importance.","Brugnara, Gianluca; Neuberger, Ulf; Mahmutoglu, Mustafa A; Foltyn, Martha; Herweh, Christian; Nagel, Simon; Schönenberger, Silvia; Heiland, Sabine; Ulfert, Christian; Ringleb, Peter Arthur; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus A; Pfaff, Johannes A R; Vollmuth, Philipp",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.030287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33040701/,250

The present study aims to investigate the impact of heat and humidity on the daily basis incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic in European countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS We selected 10 European countries, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Belarus. This region has a relatively low temperature and high humidity, and has homogenous European ethnicity with almost similar socioeconomic culture and health care system. The data on COVID-19 pandemic including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from World Health Organization (WHO). The information on daily temperature and humidity was obtained from world climate web ""Time and Date"". The daily cases, deaths, temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"" in the European region, from Jan 27, 2020 to July 17, 2020. RESULTS In 10 European countries, (Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Belarus), the daily basis mean temperature from Jan 27, 2020 to July 17, 2020 was 17.07±0.18°C, and humidity was 54.78±0.47%. The overall results revealed a significant inverse correlation between humidity and the number of cases (r= -0.134, p<0.001) and deaths (r= -0.126, p<0.001). Moreover, an increase in temperature was linked with an increase in the number of cases (r=0.062, p=0.013) and deaths (r=0.118, p<0.001). The regression analysis results further revealed that with an increase of 1% humidity the number of cases (β = -15.90, p<0.001) and deaths (β=-1.56, p<0.001) reduced significantly. Whereas, with an increase of 1°C in temperature the number of cases (β = 20.65, p<0.001) and deaths (β = 3.71, p<0.001) increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS Increase in relative humidity was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths, however, a rise in temperature was allied with an upsurge in the number of daily cases and daily deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic in European countries. The study findings on weather events and COVID-19 pandemic have an impact at European regional levels to project the incidence and mortality trends with regional weather events to enhance public health readiness and assist in planning to fight against this pandemic situation.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Sumaya, O Y; Sami, W; Shafi, K M; Meo, A S; Usmani, A M; Akram, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_22874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965017/,250

It was our concern that patients who already found themselves socially isolated (Wie et al. 2010) as a result of their hearing loss would be perhaps more susceptible to changes in their communication habits resulting in further social isolation, anxiety, and depression. We wanted to better understand how forced social isolation (as part of COVID-19 mitigation) effected a group of individuals with hearing impairment from an auditory ecology and psychosocial perspective. We hypothesized that the listening environments would be different as a result of social isolation when comparing subject's responses regarding activities and participation before COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This change would lead to an increase in experienced and perceived social isolation, anxiety, and depression. DESIGN A total of 48 adults with at least 12 months of cochlear implant (CI) experience reported their listening contexts and experiences pre-COVID and during-COVID using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA; methodology collecting a respondent's self-reports in their natural environments) through a smartphone-based app, and six paper and pencil questionnaires. The Smartphone app and paper-pencil questionnaires address topics related to their listening environment, social isolation, depression, anxiety, lifestyle and demand, loneliness, and satisfaction with amplification. Data from these two-time points were compared to better understand the effects of social distancing on the CI recipients' communication abilities. RESULTS EMA demonstrated that during-COVID CI recipients were more likely to stay home or be outdoors. CI recipients reported that they were less likely to stay indoors outside of their home relative to the pre-COVID condition. Social distancing also had a significant effect on the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the environments indicating that the listening environments had better signal-to-noise ratios. CI recipients also reported better speech understanding, less listening effort, less activity limitation due to hearing loss, less social isolation due to hearing loss, and less anxiety due to hearing loss. Retrospective questionnaires indicated that social distancing had a significant effect on the social network size, participant's personal image of themselves, and overall loneliness. CONCLUSIONS Overall, EMA provided us with a glimpse of the effect that forced social isolation has had on the listening environments and psychosocial perspectives of a select number of CI listeners. CI participants in this study reported that they were spending more time at home in a quieter environments during-COVID. Contrary to our hypothesis, CI recipients overall felt less socially isolated and reported less anxiety resulting from their hearing difficulties during-COVID in comparison to pre-COVID. This, perhaps, implies that having a more controlled environment with fewer speakers provided a more relaxing listening experience.","Dunn, Camille C; Stangl, Elizabeth; Oleson, Jacob; Smith, Michelle; Chipara, Octav; Wu, Yu-Hsiang",Ear and hearing,https://doi.org/10.1097/aud.0000000000000991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369590/,250

CASE PRESENTATION From 2009 to 2016, seven patients with esophagogastric varices with portal hypertension were treated with hand-assisted laparoscopic devascularization and splenectomy in our institute. Four men and three women with a median age of 61 years (range 35-71) were enrolled in this series. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for the perioperative variables, postoperative mortality and morbidity, and postoperative outcomes of esophagogastric varices. The median operative time was 455 (range 310-671) min. The median intraoperative blood loss was 695 (range 15-2395) ml. The median weight of removed spleen was 507 (range 242-1835) g. The conversion rate to open surgery was 0%. The median postoperative hospital stay was 21 (range 13-81) days. During a median 21 (range 3-43) months of follow-up, the mortality rate was 0%. Four postoperative complications (massive ascites, enteritis, intra-abdominal abscess, and intestinal ulcer) were observed in two patients. Those complications were treated successfully without re-operation. Esophagogastric varices in all patients disappeared or improved. Bleeding from esophagogastric varices was not observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Although our data are preliminary, hand-assisted laparoscopic devascularization and splenectomy proved an effective procedure for treating esophagogastric varices in patients with portal hypertension.","Kobayashi, Takashi; Miura, Kohei; Ishikawa, Hirosuke; Soma, Daiki; Zhang, Zhengkun; Ando, Takuya; Yuza, Kizuki; Hirose, Yuki; Katada, Tomohiro; Takizawa, Kazuyasu; Nagahashi, Masayuki; Sakata, Jun; Kameyama, Hitoshi; Wakai, Toshifumi",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-017-0387-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29058164/,250

Wallace notes that Mg deficiency is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Furthermore, hypokalemia and a lack of active Vitamin D are consequences of a Mg deficit. In this way, Mg deficiency may exacerbate the course of COVID-19. Therefore, in patients with Covid-19 permanent monitoring of the Mg status and, if necessary, supplementation should be carried out. The possible importance of Mg in COVID-19 was only recently discussed also by Iotti et al. and the German Society for Magnesium Research e.V. Considering the meaningful connections between Mg and COVID-19 there are relevant research topics that should be addressed: Does Mg deficiency increase the risk of infection with COVID-19 or the risk of a severe course of the disease? Is there an increased prevalence of Mg deficiency in COVID-19 patients? Could Mg supplementation alleviate the course of the disease in COVID-19 or reduce complications? Does pharmacological induction of hypermagnesemia via intravenous Mg provide clinical benefits for COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (for example with regard to lung function or thromboembolism)?","Micke, Oliver; Vormann, Jürgen; Kisters, Klaus",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2020.1816230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33064060/,250

Aims The aim of the present work was to develop a scale (Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder Scale-CSBD-19) that can reliably and validly assess CSBD based on ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. Method Four independent samples of 9,325 individuals completed self-reported measures from three countries (the United States, Hungary, and Germany). The psychometric properties of the CSBD-19 were examined in terms of factor structure, reliability, measurement invariance, and theoretically relevant correlates. A potential threshold was determined to identify individuals with an elevated risk of CSBD. Results The five-factor model of the CSBD-19 (i.e., control, salience, relapse, dissatisfaction, and negative consequences) had an excellent fit to the data and demonstrated appropriate associations with the correlates. Measurement invariance suggested that the CSBD-19 functions similarly across languages. Men had higher means than women. A score of 50 points was found as an optimal threshold to identify individuals at high-risk of CSBD. Conclusions The CSBD-19 is a short, valid, and reliable measure of potential CSBD based on ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines. Its use in large-scale, cross-cultural studies may promote the identification and understanding of individuals with a high risk of CSBD.","Bőthe, Beáta; Potenza, Marc N; Griffiths, Mark D; Kraus, Shane W; Klein, Verena; Fuss, Johannes; Demetrovics, Zsolt",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609629/,250

Second, regardless of the imaging method (echocardiography, MRI, and CT) this association remains. Third, the association of metabolic syndrome and atrial fibrillation seems to increase the risk of stroke. Fourth, this systematic review was considered as low risk of bias. Despite being unable to establish a clear association between EAT and stroke, we have organized and assessed all the research papers on this topic, analyzing their limitations, suggesting improvements in future pieces of research and pointing out gaps in the literature. Furthermore, the mechanistic links between increased EAT and stroke incidence remains unclear, thus, further research is warranted.","Rosa, Maria Inês; Grande, Antonio José; Lima, Leticia Dorsa; Dondossola, Eduardo Ronconi; Uggioni, Maria Laura Rodrigues; Hernandez, Adrian V; Tse, Gary; Liu, Tong; Pontes-Neto, Octávio Marques; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Neto, Mansueto Gomes; Durães, André Rodrigues; Sá, Michel Pompeu B O; Resende, Elmiro Santos; Roever, Leonardo",Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.658445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969022/,250

Blood-based diagnostic biomarkers could lead to improvements in IA management. This exploratory study examined circulating neutrophils to determine whether they carry RNA expression signatures of IAs. METHODS Blood samples were collected from patients receiving cerebral angiography. Eleven samples were collected from patients with IAs and 11 from patients without IAs as controls. Samples from the two groups were paired based on demographics and comorbidities. RNA was extracted from isolated neutrophils and subjected to next-generation RNA sequencing to obtain differential expressions for identification of an IA-associated signature. Bioinformatics analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, were used to investigate the biological function of all differentially expressed transcripts. RESULTS Transcriptome profiling identified 258 differentially expressed transcripts in patients with and without IAs. Expression differences were consistent with peripheral neutrophil activation. An IA-associated RNA expression signature was identified in 82 transcripts (p<0.05, fold-change ≥2). This signature was able to separate patients with and without IAs on hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, in an independent, unpaired, replication cohort of patients with IAs (n = 5) and controls (n = 5), the 82 transcripts separated 9 of 10 patients into their respective groups. CONCLUSION Preliminary findings show that RNA expression from circulating neutrophils carries an IA-associated signature. These findings highlight a potential to use predictive biomarkers from peripheral blood samples to identify patients with IAs.","Tutino, Vincent M; Poppenberg, Kerry E; Jiang, Kaiyu; Jarvis, James N; Sun, Yijun; Sonig, Ashish; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Kolega, John; Meng, Hui",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342213/,250

We aimed to describe the outcomes used in trials of supportive interventions for adult caregivers of people with three exemplar life-limiting conditions: heart failure, dementia or stroke. RECENT FINDINGS We performed a focussed review of 134 published trials that included interventions designed to improve caregivers' health and wellbeing and/or ability to function in their caring role. We extracted and categorized all caregiver outcomes described in the studies. We identified inconsistency in the outcomes measured; frequent use of bespoke and adapted tools (29% of outcomes were bespoke), and a lack of clarity in outcome priorities (the mean number of outcomes per trial was four [range: 1-11]). Outcome scales that purport to measure the psychological impact of the caring role were the most popular tools in all three caregiver groups. SUMMARY Outcomes used in trials related to adult caregivers are characterized by inconsistencies in outcome measure selection and assessment.

Patients with tooth agenesis and congenital anomalies (including oral cleft) and/or syndromes were excluded. Dental casts were used to measure the maximum crown dimensions of all fully erupted permanent teeth except second and third molars in mesiodistal direction. Teeth with caries, occlusal wear, mesiodistal restorations, and obvious deformities were not evaluated. Genomic DNA samples were used for genotyping. The allelic discrimination of 13 genetic variants was performed. The associations between TS and genotype were analyzed by linear regression, adjusted by gender at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS Genetic polymorphisms in the tooth agenesis-related genes studied here were associated with increased and decreased TS, in both maxilla and mandible (p < 0.05).

This study aimed to investigate the impact of explicit cueing on anxiety, arousal, and pain experience during the anticipation and delivery of noxious thermal heat stimulations. Fifty-two healthy volunteers were randomised to receive explicit instructions about visual cue-stimulus temperature pairings, or no explicit instructions about the cue-stimulus pairs. A pain anxiety task was used to investigate the effects of explicit cueing on anticipatory anxiety, pain experience and electrophysiological responses. Participants who received explicit instructions about the cue-stimulus pairs (i.e., the relationship between the colour of the cue and the temperature of the associated stimuli) reported significantly higher subjective anxiety prior to the delivery of the thermal heat stimuli (p = .025, partial eta squared = .10). There were no effects of explicit cueing on subsequent pain intensity, unpleasantness, or the electrophysiological response to stimulus delivery. The perceived intensity and unpleasantness of the stimuli decreased across the blocks of the paradigm. In both groups anticipating the ambiguous cue elicited the largest change in electrophysiological arousal, indicating that not knowing the impending stimulus temperature led to increased arousal, compared to being certain of receiving a high temperature thermal stimulus (both p < .001). Perceived stimulus intensity varied between ambiguous and non-ambiguous cues, depending on the temperature of the stimulus. Together these findings highlight the impact and importance of explicit cueing and uncertainty in experimental pain studies, and how these factors influence the way healthy individuals perceive and react to noxious and innocuous thermal stimuli.","Tracy, Lincoln M; Gibson, Stephen J; Georgiou-Karistianis, Nellie; Giummarra, Melita J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28832636/,250
94322,Ethics committees in the time of COVID-19.,2020,"Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is implicated in many viral infections. However, its role in West Nile virus (WNV) infection remains controversial. In the present study, we examined the relationship between WNV infection and autophagy in infected cells. We demonstrated that LC3-II expression, a molecular marker for autophagosomal membranes, was enhanced in WNV-infected cells 6h post-infection. LC3-II expression was further enhanced in WNV-inoculated cells when treated with a lysosomal protease inhibitor. Meanwhile, WNV replication in cells lacking Atg5, an essential factor for autophagy, was increased compared with replication in wild-type cells. In addition, WNV replication was inhibited in cells lacking Atg5 when they were transfected with an ATG5 expression plasmid. These results suggest an antiviral role for autophagy in WNV-infected cells. We also examined which viral replication stages were affected by autophagy by using a Tat-beclin 1 peptide to induce autophagy and pseudo-infectious WNV reporter virus particles (WNV-RVPs) that monitor viral genome replication and gene expression stages via GFP expression. We found that autophagy induction in HeLa cells by Tat-beclin 1 peptide 3h after WNV inoculation inhibited viral replication, and GFP expression was significantly inhibited in wild-type cells when compared with cells lacking Atg5. Taken together, these results suggest that autophagy is induced by WNV infection, and that this induction inhibits WNV replication at the viral genome replication and gene expression stages.","Kobayashi, Shintaro; Orba, Yasuko; Yamaguchi, Hiroki; Takahashi, Kenta; Sasaki, Michihito; Hasebe, Rie; Kimura, Takashi; Sawa, Hirofumi",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25091564/,250

The uPAR specific peptide AE105 was conjugated to the macrocyclic chelator DOTA and labeled with (64)Cu for targeted molecular imaging with PET. The safety, pharmacokinetic, biodistribution profile and radiation dosimetry after a single intravenous dose of (64)Cu-DOTA-AE105 were assessed by serial PET and computed tomography (CT) in 4 prostate, 3 breast and 3 bladder cancer patients. Safety assessment with laboratory blood screening tests was performed before and after PET ligand injection. In a subgroup of the patients, the in vivo stability of our targeted PET ligand was determined in collected blood and urine. No adverse or clinically detectable side effects in any of the 10 patients were found. The ligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from plasma and tissue compartments by renal excretion. In addition, high uptake in both primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases was seen and paralleled high uPAR expression in excised tumor tissue.

98113,Triage and justice in an unjust pandemic: ethical allocation of scarce medical resources in the setting of racial and socioeconomic disparities.,2020-10-16,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a lifelong and recurrent illness, such that many individuals require multiple courses of antidepressant medication treatment. While some patients respond completely to each course of treatment, many do not, and with each unsuccessful antidepressant trial the likelihood that a patient will respond decreases. This raises the possibility that neurophysiologic response in subsequent antidepressant treatment may be influenced by learning processes including sensitization, habituation, and/or classical conditioning. Classical conditioning would entail the association of cues such as pill-taking (conditioned stimuli; CS) with the effects of active medication (unconditioned stimulus; US), such that later presentation of the CS alone would come to elicit a conditioned response (CR). Such effects could be revealed by blinded administration of placebo following a period of treatment with active medication. Habituation effects (tolerance), or sensitization effects (increased response), which require only repeated exposure to a stimulus, might be evidenced after repeated courses of antidepressant treatment. Knowledge of how learning processes impact neurophysiologic response to successive courses of antidepressant treatment would have relevance for clinical populations. Specific hypotheses, however, may be tested in healthy non-clinical samples to avoid potential confounding factors related to severity or chronicity of illness. Learning theories would suggest two hypotheses: (1) neurophysiologic response to placebo will differ between subjects who were previously treated with antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo (classical conditioning hypothesis); and (2) neurophysiologic response to an initial course of antidepressant treatment will differ from response to a repeated course of antidepressant treatment. Pilot data addressed these hypotheses in healthy never-depressed women who had previously received four weeks of venlafaxine IR, 150 mg (antidepressant-experienced subjects; n=2) or matching placebo (antidepressant-naive subjects; n=4) under double-blind conditions. Six-and-a-half years later, we treated these six women with placebo for one week, followed by four weeks of double-blind treatment with venlafaxine IR, 150 mg. Brain functional changes over the course of treatment were assessed using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to compare prefrontal neurophysiologic responses between subjects who had, versus had not, previously been exposed to venlafaxine. Antidepressant-experienced versus antidepressant-naive subjects showed greater decreases in prefrontal cordance (PFC) during venlafaxine administration (sensitization hypothesis) but did not show significantly different PFC changes during treatment with placebo in this small pilot sample (classical conditioning hypothesis).

The outcomes of these patients, for whom endotracheal intubation is not mandatory, depend on the degree of hypoxia, the presence of comorbidities and complications, and their illness severity. The use of NIV as an alternative to invasive ventilation in severely hypoxemic patients with ARDS (ie, P(aO(2))/F(IO(2)) < 200) is not generally advisable and should be limited to hemodynamically stable patients who can be closely monitored in an intensive care unit by highly skilled staff. Early NIV application may be extremely helpful in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates, in whom intubation dramatically increases the risk of infection, pneumonia, and death. The use of NIV in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and other airborne diseases has generated debate, despite encouraging clinical results, mainly because of safety issues. Overall, the high rate of NIV failure suggests a cautious approach to NIV use in patients with ALI/ARDS, including early initiation, intensive monitoring, and prompt intubation if signs of NIV failure emerge.","Nava, Stefano; Schreiber, Ania; Domenighetti, Guido",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22008399/,250

This study investigated whether home-based telerehabilitation was equivalent to centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation in people with chronic respiratory disease. METHODS A multicentre randomised controlled trial with assessor blinding, powered for equivalence was undertaken. Individuals with a chronic respiratory disease referred to pulmonary rehabilitation at four participating sites (one rural) were eligible and randomised using concealed allocation to pulmonary rehabilitation or telerehabilitation. Both programmes were two times per week for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was change in Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire Dyspnoea (CRQ-D) domain at end-rehabilitation, with a prespecified equivalence margin of 2.5 points. Follow-up was at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, symptoms, self-efficacy and psychological well-being. RESULTS 142 participants were randomised to pulmonary rehabilitation or telerehabilitation with 96% and 97% included in the intention-to-treat analysis, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups for any outcome at either time point. Both groups achieved meaningful improvement in dyspnoea and exercise capacity at end-rehabilitation. However, we were unable to confirm equivalence of telerehabilitation for the primary outcome ΔCRQ-D at end-rehabilitation (mean difference (MD) (95% CI) -1 point (-3 to 1)), and inferiority of telerehabilitation could not be excluded at either time point (12-month follow-up: MD -1 point (95% CI -4 to 1)). At end-rehabilitation, telerehabilitation demonstrated equivalence for 6-minute walk distance (MD -6 m, 95% CI -26 to 15) with possibly superiority of telerehabilitation at 12 months (MD 14 m, 95% CI -10 to 38). CONCLUSION telerehabilitation may not be equivalent to centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation for all outcomes, but is safe and achieves clinically meaningful benefits. When centre-based pulmonary rehabilitation is not available, telerehabilitation may provide an alternative programme model.

METHODS The protocol for this Systematic Review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020203634). Four databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and WEB of SCIENCE) were consulted up until September 2020. A total of fourteen studies [in vivo (n = 2), case reports (n = 7), case series without control arm (n = 3), randomized clinical trials (RCT, n = 2)], were reviewed. Data were synthesized narratively for the case reports, along with a proportion meta-analysis for the case series studies (n = 102 subjects) without a control arm followed by another meta-analysis for case series studies with a defined control arm (n = 111 subjects) for their primary outcomes. RESULTS Overall, seven non-duplicate case reports (n = 9 participants) were narratively reviewed and found to have broad AMR remission events at the 1-month time point. Proportion meta-analysis of case series studies showed an overall 0.58 (95% CI: 0.42-0.74) AMR remission. Additionally, a significant difference in AMR remission was observed in FMT vs treatment naïve (RR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20-0.99) and moderate heterogeneity (I2=65%).

SPR technology has contributed significantly to our understanding of the complex biophysical determinants of HIV neutralization and offers a platform for preclinical evaluation of vaccine candidates. In particular, the concept of reverse-engineering HIV vaccine targets based on known broadly neutralizing antibody modalities is explored and extended to include other infectious diseases, such as malaria and influenza, and other diseases such as cancer. The analytical capacity afforded by SPR includes serum screening to monitor immune responses and highly efficient quality-control surveillance measures.

Surgical treatment consists of CDC excision and biliary-enteric reconstruction. Recently, some institutions have reported successful CDC excision by using minimally invasive techniques. In this study, we report our experience with the laparoscopic management of CDC, with a focus on key operative maneuvers that enhance the likelihood of successful excision. METHODS Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent the laparoscopic excision of CDC and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Between October 2003 and November 2007, we performed laparoscopic CDC excision in 9 patients (8 female and 1 male). Median age was 4 years (range, 8 months to 16 years). There were 7 type I and 2 type IV cysts, according to Todani's classification. Average cyst size was 4.4 cm (range, 1.3-8.5). The procedures were performed by utilizing four or five trochars. RESULTS Six of 9 children presented with preoperative pancreatitis, 1 with abdominal pain, 1 with jaundice, and 1 was found incidentally. Three patients required the conversion to laparotomy due to dense adhesions, secondary to pancreatitis. Six patients underwent successful laparoscopic procedures, 5 had complete cyst excisions, and 1 underwent a proximal excision with distal mucosectomy. Of the 3 patients who required conversion, 2 underwent complete excisions; the other underwent a proximal excision, distal mucosectomy. There were no intraoperative complications. One patient had a postoperative bile leak that required an open hepaticojejunostomy revision. Eight patients had an uneventful recovery. Oral feedings were resumed within an average of 3.4 days (range, 2-9). Average time to discharge was 6.1 days (range, 5-12). Average follow-up time was 18 months (range, 4-48). No further laboratory abnormalities were detected in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic resection of CDC and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in children is an excellent treatment option. Preoperative pancreatitis may cause increased technical difficulty, necessitating a conversion.

Hence, other therapeutic options that will allow us to obtain a quick and safe antidepressant effect by modulating glutamatergic transmission are needed. Antagonists of mGlu2/3 receptors, which share some mechanisms of action with ketamine, may be good candidates to obtain this effect. Here, we show that the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 induced a dose-dependent antidepressant-like effect in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in C57BL/6J mice after both single and subchronic (three-day) administration. Furthermore, a noneffective dose of LY341495 (0.3 mg/kg) given jointly with a noneffective dose of ketamine (3 mg/kg) reversed the CUMS-induced behavioral effects, indicating that coadministration of ketamine with an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist might allow its therapeutically effective dose to be lowered. Western blot results indicate that mTOR pathway activation might be involved in the mechanism of action of this drug combination. Moreover, the combined doses of both substances did not produce undesirable behavioral effects characteristic of a higher dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg) commonly used in rodent studies to induce antidepressant effects. Coadministration of low doses of ketamine and LY341495 did not induce the hyperactivity typical of NMDA channel blockers, did not disturb short-term memory in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, and did not disturb motor coordination in the rotarod test. Our research not only confirmed the earlier data on the rapid antidepressant effect of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists but also indicated that such compounds can safely lower the effective dose of ketamine.","Pałucha-Poniewiera, Agnieszka; Podkowa, Karolina; Rafało-Ulińska, Anna",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400944/,250

It is posing a serious health and economic challenge worldwide. However, case fatality rates (CFRs) have varied amongst various countries ranging from 0 to 8.91%. We have evaluated the effect of selected socio-economic and health indicators to explain this variation in CFR. Countries reporting a minimum of 50 cases as on 14th March 2020, were selected for this analysis. Data about the socio-economic indicators of each country was accessed from the World bank database and data about the health indicators were accessed from the World Health Organisation (WHO) database. Various socioeconomic indicators and health indicators were selected for this analysis. After selecting from univariate analysis, the indicators with the maximum correlation were used to build a model using multiple variable linear regression with a forward selection of variables and using adjusted R-squared score as the metric. We found univariate regression results were significant for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, POD 30/70 (Probability Of Dying Between Age 30 And Exact Age 70 From Any of Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, Diabetes or Chronic Respiratory Disease), HCI (Human Capital Index), GNI(Gross National Income) per capita, life expectancy, medical doctors per 10000 population, as these parameters negatively corelated with CFR (rho = -0.48 to -0.38 , p<0.05). Case fatality rate was regressed using ordinary least squares (OLS) against the socio-economic and health indicators. The indicators in the final model were GDP per capita, POD 30/70, HCI, life expectancy, medical doctors per 10,000, median age, current health expenditure per capita, number of confirmed cases and population in millions. The adjusted R-squared score was 0.306. Developing countries with a poor economy are especially vulnerable in terms of COVID-19 mortality and underscore the need to have a global policy to deal with this on-going pandemic.

The LiVac laparoscopic liver retractor system (LiVac retractor) comprises a soft silicone ring attached to suction tubing and connected to a regulated source of suction. The suction tubing extends alongside existing ports. When placed between the liver and diaphragm, and suction applied, a vacuum is created within the ring, keeping these in apposition. Following successful proof-of-concept animal testing, a clinical study was conducted to evaluate the performance and safety of the retractor in patients. METHODS The study was a dual-centre, single-surgeon, open-label study and recruited ten patients scheduled to undergo routine upper abdominal laparoscopic surgery including cholecystectomy, primary gastric banding surgery or fundoplication. The study was conducted at two sites and was approved by the institutions' ethics committees. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of the LiVac retractor in patients undergoing upper abdominal single- or multi-port laparoscopic surgery. Performance was measured by the attainment of milestones for the retractor and accessory bevel, where used, and safety outcomes through the recording of adverse events, physical parameters, pain scales, blood tests and a post-operative liver ultrasound. RESULTS The LiVac retractor achieved both primary and secondary performance and safety objectives in all patients. No serious adverse events and no device-related adverse events or device deficiencies were reported. CONCLUSION The LiVac retractor achieved effective liver retraction without clinically significant trauma and has potential application in multi- or single-port laparoscopic upper abdominal surgery. As a separate incision is not required, the use of the LiVac retractor in multi-port surgery therefore reduces the number of incisions.","Gan, Philip; Bingham, Judy",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4272-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26092007/,250

This requires nanoscale spatial precision and control to fabricate structures/defects. Lithographic techniques are widely used for nanostructuring in which a geometric pattern on a mask is transferred to a resist by photons or charged particles and subsequently engraved on the substrate. However, direct mask-less fabrication has only been possible with electron and ion beams. That is because light has an inherent disadvantage; the diffraction limit makes it difficult to interact with matter on dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light. Here we demonstrate spatially controlled formation of nanocones on a silicon surface with a positional precision of 50 nm using femtosecond laser ablation comprising a superposition of optical vector vortex and Gaussian beams. Such control and precision opens new opportunities for nano-printing of materials using techniques such as laser-induced forward transfer and in general broadens the scope of laser processing of materials.","Rahimian, M G; Jain, A; Larocque, H; Corkum, P B; Karimi, E; Bhardwaj, V R",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69390-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724048/,250

All patients from our IBD unit were informed via email, social networks and websites about the convenience of continuing with treatment. In addition, patients were contacted by telephone a few days before to remind them of their appointment and the importance of adherence1. In our center, 164 patients were on an intravenous biological treatment (infliximab or vedolizumab) and had an appointment at the outpatient clinic during the confinement period in Madrid from March 16 to May 2, 2020. Thirty patients (18.3%) were identified whose treatment was not administered on the indicated date. The infusion of the biological treatment was delayed for a mean 27.9 days (2.9 - 60.9 days) and from the last administration for a mean 68.5 days (SD: 21.24). The reason was fear of going to the hospital due to COVID-19 in 43.3% of cases (13 patients). Most (8, 61.5%) patients were males with a mean age of 49.6 years and had Crohn's disease (92.3%). In 20% (6 patients) of cases, the reason was due to a confirmed COVID-19 infection, being outside of Madrid in 26.7% (8 patients) and forgetfulness in 3 patients. No differences were found between the days of delay in drug administration and clinical activity (32.1 vs 40.2, p = 0.36), concomitant treatment with thiopurines (35.8 vs 38.4 days, p = 0.78) or a history of intestinal resection surgery (50.9 vs 35.3 days, p = 0.16).

The Distress Thermometer is a short screening tool developed for use in oncology, to detect individuals who would benefit from further psychological assessment. However the optimal cut-off to detect indicative psychological morbidity in patients with advanced cancer receiving specialist palliative care is unclear. AIM To provide the first validation of the Distress Thermometer in an advanced cancer population receiving specialist palliative care in a UK hospice setting. DESIGN Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of cut-offs indicative of psychological morbidity on the Distress Thermometer in comparison to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Data were derived from 202 patients with advanced cancer who were approached on admission to inpatient or day hospice care, with 139 patients providing complete data on both measures. RESULTS The area under the curve was optimal using a Distress Thermometer cut-off score of ⩾6 for total distress and for anxiety, and a cut-off score of ⩾4 optimal when screening for depression. CONCLUSIONS The Distress Thermometer is a valid, accurate screening tool to be used in advanced cancer but with caution in relation to the lack of specificity. With little variation between the area under the curve scores, arguably a Distress Thermometer cut-off score of ⩾5 is most appropriate in screening for all types of psychological morbidity if sensitivity is to be prioritised.","Graham-Wisener, Lisa; Dempster, Martin; Sadler, Aaroon; McCann, Luke; McCorry, Noleen K",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216320954339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912055/,250

METHODS Overall hospital blood use and medical records of adult patients with COVID-19 were extracted for two institutions. Multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to estimate associations between the outcomes transfusion and mortality and patient factors. RESULTS Daily blood use decreased compared to pre-COVID-19 levels; the effect was more significant for platelets (29% and 34%) compared to red blood cells (25% and 20%) at the two institutions, respectively. Surgical and oncologic services had a decrease in average daily use of platelets of 52% and 30%, and red blood cells of 39% and 25%, respectively. A total of 128 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized, and 13 (10%) received at least one transfusion due to anemia secondary to chronic illness (n = 7), recent surgery (n = 3), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 3). Lower baseline platelet count and admission to the intensive care unit were associated with increased risk of transfusion. The blood group distribution in patients with COVID-19 was 37% group O, 40% group A, 18% group B, and 5% group AB. Non-type O was not associated with increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION The response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic included changes in routine hospital operations that allowed for the provision of a sufficient level of care for patients with and without COVID-19. Although blood type may play a role in COVID-19 susceptibility, it did not seem to be associated with patient mortality.","Pagano, Monica B; Cataife, Guido; Fertrin, Kleber Yotsumoto; Gernsheimer, Terry; R Hess, John; Staley, Elizabeth; Clark, Christine; Senn, Nina; Tuott, Erin; C Tsang, Hamilton",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856307/,250
110635,Reimagining an Unfolding Case in the Online Clinical Arena.,2020-07-21,"BACKGROUND MicroRNAs are a class of important small noncoding RNAs, which have been reported to be involved in the processes of tumorigenesis and development by targeting a few genes. Existing studies show that the imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is closely related to the initiation and development of cancers. However, the impact of miRNAs on this imbalance has not been studied systematically. RESULTS In this study, we first construct a cell fate miRNA-gene regulatory network. Then, we propose a systematical method for calculating the global impact of miRNAs on cell fate genes based on the shortest path. Results on breast cancer and liver cancer datasets show that most of the cell fate genes are perturbed by the differentially expressed miRNAs. Most of the top-identified miRNAs are verified in the Human MicroRNA Disease Database (HMDD) and are related to breast and liver cancers. Function analysis shows that the top 20 miRNAs regulate multiple cell fate related function modules and interact tightly based on their functional similarity. Furthermore, more than half of them can promote sensitivity or induce resistance to some anti-cancer drugs. Besides, survival analysis demonstrates that the top-ranked miRNAs are significantly related to the overall survival time in the breast and liver cancers group. CONCLUSION In sum, this study can help to systematically study the important role of miRNAs on proliferation and apoptosis and thereby uncover the key miRNAs during the process of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the results of this study will contribute to the development of clinical therapy based miRNAs for cancers.","Xu, Peng; Wu, Qian; Lu, Deyang; Yu, Jian; Rao, Yongsheng; Kou, Zheng; Fang, Gang; Liu, Wenbin; Han, Henry",BMC bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03732-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894041/,250

111940,Protect Indigenous peoples from COVID-19.,2020-04-17,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented pressure on a nursing workforce that is already under considerable mental strain due to an overloaded system. Convergent evidence from the current and previous pandemics indicates that nurses experience the highest levels of psychological distress compared with other health professionals. Nurse leaders face particular challenges in mitigating risk and supporting nursing staff to negotiate moral distress and fatigue during large-scale, sustained crises. Synthesizing the burgeoning literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress faced by nurses and identifying effective interventions to reduce poor mental health outcomes will enable nurse leaders to support the resilience of their teams. Aim This paper aims to (1) synthesize existing literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress among nurses and (2) identify recommendations for nurse leaders to support the psychological needs of nursing staff. Methods Comprehensive searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and PsycINFO (via Ovid); CINAHL (via EBSCOHost); and ERIC (via ProQUEST). The rapid review was completed in accordance with the World Health Organization Rapid Review Guide. Key Findings Thematic analysis of selected studies suggests that nurses are at an increased risk for stress, burnout and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Younger female nurses with less clinical experience are more vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes.","Sriharan, Abi; West, Keri J; Almost, Joan; Hamza, Aden",Nursing leadership,https://doi.org/10.12927/cjnl.2021.26459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837685/,250

Here we report on a questionnaire-based retrospective cohort study of the prevalence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among participants in swimming activities in Denmark in the last five months of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight of 162 swimming activities with a SARS-CoV-2 positive participant led to transmission to 23 other participants. Overall, the percentage of episodes leading to transmission was 4.9% (competitive swimming 8.9%; recreational swimming 1.3%). Overall, the incidence rate of transmission was 19.5 participants per 100,000 pool activity hours (corresponding values: 43.5 and 4.7 for competitive and recreational swimming, respectively). Compliance with precautionary restrictions was highest regarding hand hygiene (98.1%) and lowest in distancing personal sports bags (69.9%). As a result of low statistical power, the study showed no significant effect of restrictions. Insight into the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during indoor swimming is needed to estimate the efficiency of restrictive measures on this and other sports and leisure activities. Only when we know how the virus spreads through various settings, optimal strategies to handle the COVID-19 pandemic can be developed.","Termansen, Martin Brink; Christiansen, Ask Vest; Frische, Sebastian",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.14071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606662/,250

113887,Perceptions of Authentic Nurse Leadership and Work Environment and the Pandemic Impact for Nurse Leaders and Clinical Nurses.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIM The manner in which colorectal lesions are being detected with PillCam COLON2 capsule endoscopy (CCE2) has markedly improved in recent days. However, limited data are available on CCE2 for detecting laterally spreading tumors (LSTs). The aim of this study was to compare CCE2 with optical colonoscopy (OC), which is currently the gold standard used in the detection of LSTs. METHODS We performed a prospective, single-academic center study comparing CCE2 with OC in patients with LSTs diagnosed using OC, which was performed during the 3-month period prior to CCE2. We focused on the sensitivity and specificity of CCE2 for detecting LSTs. LSTs were classified into the LST-granular type (LST-G) or the LST-non-granular type (LST-NG). RESULTS Thirty patients (mean age 59.5 years) were enrolled. Of them, 21 LSTs (7 LST-Gs and 14 LST-NGs) were evaluated in this study. The mean diameter of the LSTs was 27 ± 15 mm (range 10-60 mm). Histopathological diagnoses of the LSTs were as follows: tubular adenoma, 12 cases (57%); sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P), 4 cases (19%); Tis carcinoma, 1 case (5%); and T1 carcinoma, 4 cases (19 LSTs were found in the following locations: cecum, 1 case (5%); ascending colon, 6 cases (29%); transverse colon, 6 cases, (29%); descending colon, 1 case (5%); sigmoid colon, 3 cases (13%); and rectum, 4 cases (19%). The colon cleansing level was adequate in all cases. The sensitivity and specificity of CCE2 for detecting LSTs were 81 and 100% respectively. For detecting LST-Gs and LST-NGs, the sensitivity and specificity were 71 and 100%, and 86 and 100%, respectively. There were 4 false-negative cases (LST-G (18 mm), cecum; LST-G (20 mm), sigmoid colon; LST-NG (25 mm), transverse colon; LST-NG (20 mm), transverse colon). CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity for detecting LSTs is lower with CCE2 than it is with OC, especially for LSTs located on the right colon or for SSA/P.","Igawa, Atsushi; Oka, Shiro; Tanaka, Shinji; Otani, Ichiro; Kunihara, Sayoko; Chayama, Kazuaki",Digestion,https://doi.org/10.1159/000452367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28052292/,250

Well-structured open data and the smart systems that make the appropriate use of it are invaluable and can help health researchers and professionals to find the appropriate information by, e.g., configuring the monitoring of information or refining a specific query on a disease. METHODS We present an automated text classifier approach based on the MEDLINE/MeSH thesaurus, trained on the manual annotation of more than 26 million expert-annotated scientific abstracts. The classifier was developed tailor-fit to the public health and health research domain experts, in the light of their specific challenges and needs. We have applied the proposed methodology on three specific health domains: the Coronavirus, Mental Health and Diabetes, considering the pertinence of the first, and the known relations with the other two health topics. RESULTS A classifier is trained on the MEDLINE dataset that can automatically annotate text, such as scientific articles, news articles or medical reports with relevant concepts from the MeSH thesaurus. CONCLUSIONS The proposed text classifier shows promising results in the evaluation of health-related news. The application of the developed classifier enables the exploration of news and extraction of health-related insights, based on the MeSH thesaurus, through a similar workflow as in the usage of PubMed, with which most health researchers are familiar.","Pita Costa, Joao; Rei, Luis; Stopar, Luka; Fuart, Flavio; Grobelnik, Marko; Mladenić, Dunja; Novalija, Inna; Staines, Anthony; Pääkkönen, Jarmo; Konttila, Jenni; Bidaurrazaga, Joseba; Belar, Oihana; Henderson, Christine; Epelde, Gorka; Gabaráin, Mónica Arrúe; Carlin, Paul; Wallace, Jonathan",Artificial intelligence in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2021.102053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875160/,250
114123,Covid-19: A V shaped recovery for the NHS?,2020-09-30,"STUDY DESIGN A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. OBJECTIVE The aim was to examine whether posterior lumbar interbody fusion with cortical bone trajectory screw fixation (CBT-PLIF) is inferior to PLIF using traditional trajectory screw fixation (TT-PLIF) regarding early fusion status and whether the titanium-coated polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage (TP cage) improves early fusion status compared with the same shape pure PEEK cage (P cage). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA We recently reported that the fusion rate was relatively lower after CBT-PLIF than after TT-PLIF, although no significant difference was found and that compared with the carbon PEEK cage, the TP cage significantly reduced the incidence of vertebral endplate cysts (cyst signs) and slightly improved the early fusion rate at 1 year after CBT-PLIF. MATERIALS AND METHODS The subjects were 37 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using P cages (TT-P group), 24 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using P cages (CBT-P group), 32 patients undergoing TT-PLIF using TP cages (TT-TP group), and 20 patients undergoing CBT-PLIF using TP cages (CBT-TP group). On multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 6 months after surgery, cyst signs were evaluated and classified into diffuse or local cysts. Early fusion status was assessed using both dynamic plain radiographs and multiplanar reconstruction computed tomography at 1-year postoperatively. RESULTS The incidence of the diffuse cyst was 27.0% in the TT-P group, 29.2% in the CBT-P group, 25.0% in the TT-TP group and 25.0% in the CBT-TP group (P>0.05). The early fusion rate was 75.7% in the TT-P group, 75.0% in the CBT-P group, 71.9% in the TT-TP group and 75.0% in the CBT-TP group (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that CBT-PLIF resulted in the equivalent early fusion status to TT-PLIF and that compared with the same shape P cage, the TP cage did not improve early fusion status after both TT-PLIF and CBT-PLIF.","Sakaura, Hironobu; Ikegami, Daisuke; Fujimori, Takahito; Sugiura, Tsuyoshi; Mukai, Yoshihiro",Clinical spine surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/bsd.0000000000001237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369910/,250

However, the patient had severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 80%) within a few minutes of performing right one lung ventilation (OLV). On bronchoscopic examination, proper tube location was confirmed. Bronchodilator nebulization and steroid injection were attempted with no effect. While searching for the cause of the hypoxemia, we found that the breath sound from the right lung had become very weak and distant compared with that from initial auscultation. Right pneumothorax was diagnosed on chest X-ray and a chest tube was inserted. After confirming pneumothorax resolution, we re-tried right OLV and were able to proceed with the left lung lavage without signs of aggravating air leak, loss of tidal volume, or severe hypoxemia.","Ahn, Hyun-Joo; Yang, Mikyung; Kim, Jie Ae; Heo, Burnyoung; Kim, Jin-Kyoung; Park, So Yoon",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2017.70.4.462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28794843/,250

We explore issues around researching 'everyday health', including the generation and interpretation of source materials, and the role of empathy and emotion in interactions with different audiences as we share these materials in public engagement activities. We discuss three case studies of engagement activities to draw out potential uses of source materials and the responses of different audiences to these materials, and reflect on what we have learnt since embarking on these public engagement activities. We took into our interactions with different audiences the belief that fully historicised understandings of 'health' enrich individual lives and create new capacities for meaningful action now. The public engagement activities we carried out reinforced this belief, but also caused us to question some of our assumptions. In particular, an activity with trainee healthcare professionals designed to demonstrate how active and empathetic listening can prevent the unintentional infliction of harm in healthcare settings achieved this end-but did so in a way that was itself unintentionally insensitive to the pressures healthcare professionals face. Medical humanities can help to contextualise, nuance and improve healthcare practice-but only through active listening and dialogue across medicine and the humanities. We conclude by considering how these activities, which currently rely on the interpersonal relations of the team with audiences, might be adapted and preserved in digital form beyond the span of the project.","Loughran, Tracey; Mahoney, Kate; Payling, Daisy",Medical humanities,https://doi.org/10.1136/medhum-2020-012102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035180/,250

The aim of this paper was to discuss the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurological complications during the course of COVID-19. STATE OF THE ART Neurological symptoms, such as impairment of taste or smell, headache, nausea and/or altered consciousness, are commonly described in COVID-19 patients, although there are emerging clinical reports of more serious conditions such as acute cerebrovascular accidents, encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Whether these manifestations are the direct consequence of viral invasion of the central nervous system, or are caused by indirect mechanisms, is yet to be established. Studies to date have indicated that neurological lesions found in the brains of COVID-19 patients are a combination of direct cytopathic effects caused by SARS-CoV-2 replication and indirect effects due to hypoxia, excessive cytokine reaction, impaired immune response, and cerebrovascular injury induced by viral infection. Studies are still pending into possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion encompassing the haematopoietic pathway via the blood-brain barrier and retrograde axonal transport through the cranial nerves. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS A thorough understanding of SARS-CoV-2 involvement in neurological complications is still lacking. However, our knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 virulence is rapidly expanding, and that has inclined the author to prepare this comprehensive review in the hope that it will improve understanding about the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological abnormalities associated with COVID-19. FUTURE DIRECTIONS A future detailed study should explore the diagnostics and disease mechanisms so as to enable the development of better therapeutic strategies to reduce the severity of COVID-19 neurological complications.","Bratosiewicz-Wąsik, Jolanta",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/pjnns.a2021.0072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642927/,250

This study aimed to investigate possible risk factors for ER and provide further empirical data for prevention and clinical treatment strategies. METHODS A retrospective investigation of 116 concurrent ER cases was conducted. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between each potential risk (or protective) factor and ER. The clinical characteristics of the 71 hospitalized patients were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS After screening, the following variables significantly increased the risk of ER: shorter length of service (recruits, odds ratios [OR] 7.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.58-21.75), higher body mass index (BMI, OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.03-1.26), lack of physical exercise in the last half year (< once a month, OR 3.20, 95%CI 1.08-9.44), and prior heat injury (OR 2.94, 95%CI 1.26-6.89). Frequent fruit consumption (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.33-0.99), active hydration habit (OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.20-0.67), water replenishment ≥2 L on the training day (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.05-0.45), and water replenishment ≥500 mL within 1 h before training (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.88) significantly decreased the risk of ER. Of the 71 hospitalized patients, 41 (57.7%) were diagnosed with hypokalemia on admission. DISCUSSION In military training, emphasis should be placed on incremental adaptation training prior to more intense training, and close attention should be given to overweight and previously sedentary recruits.

However, these have not yet been accepted as standard monitoring devices for anesthesiology. The primary reason is that the use of these monitoring devices does not completely prevent awareness during surgery, and the development of these devices has not taken into account the neurophysiological mechanisms of hypnotic agents, thus making it possible to show different levels of unconsciousness in the same brain status. An alternative is to monitor EEGs that are not signal processed with numerical values presented by these monitoring devices. Several studies have reported that power spectral analysis alone can distinguish the effects of different hypnotic agents on consciousness changes.

APPROACH This paper analyses the role of legal and ethical considerations for pandemic preparedness, including an exploration of the relevance of cross-jurisdictional and cross-cultural perspectives in assessing the validity of goals for harmonisation of laws and policies both within and between nations. Australian and international experience is reviewed in various areas, including distribution of vaccines during a pandemic, the distribution of authority between national and local levels of government, and global and regional equity issues for poorer countries. CONCLUSION This paper finds that questions such as those of distributional justice (resource allocation) and regulatory frameworks raise important issues about the cultural and ethical acceptability of planning measures. Serious doubt is cast on a 'one size fits all' approach to international planning for managing a pandemic. It is concluded that a more nuanced approach than that contained in international guidelines may be required if an effective response is to be constructed internationally. IMPLICATIONS The paper commends the wisdom of reliance on 'soft law', international guidance that leaves plenty of room for each nation to construct its response in conformity with its own cultural and value requirements.","Bennett, Belinda; Carney, Terry",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-6405.2010.00492.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23331351/,250
125032,"Covid-19: 90% of cases will hit NHS over nine week period, chief medical officer warns.",2020-03-05,"PURPOSE We studied the response of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) to the β-emitter (131)I, which affects the entire cell and to the Auger electron emitter (125)I-deoxyuridine ((125)I-dU), primarily affecting the deoxyribonuleic acid (DNA). The effects were also studied in keratinocytes as a prototype for somatic cells. METHODS HESC (H1) and human keratinocytes (HaCaT, human) were exposed to (125)I-dU (5 × 10(-5) - 5 MBq/ml) and (131)I-iodide (5 × 10(-5) - 12.5 MBq/ml) and apoptosis was measured by DNA-fragmentation. Cell morphology was studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Transcriptional profiling was done on the Agilent oligonucleotide microarray platform. RESULTS Auger-process induced no apoptosis but a strong transcriptional response in hESC. In contrast, HaCaT cells showed a pronounced induction of apoptosis but only a moderate transcriptional response. Transcriptional response of hESC was similar after (125)I-dU and (131)I treatments, whereas HaCaT cells expressed a much more pronounced response to (125)I-dU than to (131)I. A striking radiation-induced down-regulation of pluripotency genes was observed in hESC whereas in keratinocytes the enriched gene annotations were related primarily to apoptosis, cell division and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS Human embryonic stem cells respond to ionizing radiation by (125)I-dU and (131)I in a different way compared to keratinocytes. Transcriptional response and gene expression appear to facilitate an escape from programmed cell death by striking a new path which probably leads to cell differentiation.","Fischer, Thomas; Sudbrock, Ferdinand; Pomplun, Ekkehard; Kriehuber, Ralf; Winkler, Johannes; Matzkies, Matthias; Dellweg, Alexander; Dietlein, Markus; Arnhold, Stefan; Royer, Hans-Dieter; Schicha, Harald; Hescheler, Jürgen; Schomäcker, Klaus",International journal of radiation biology,https://doi.org/10.3109/09553002.2012.683510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22494164/,250

Strategies that combat pediatric obesity have not yet been fully determined. While the implementation of some interventions in preschool (ages 2-5) populations have demonstrated successful results, others have proven to be inconclusive and less have focused specifically on low socioeconomic populations. This scoping review aims to examine the literature to study the effectiveness of the school-based interventions in low socioeconomic settings on adiposity-related outcomes among preschoolers. PubMed/MEDLINE and EBSCO (ERIC (Education Resource Information Center) and Food Science Source) were used to conduct the search strategy. A total of 15 studies were assessed that met the inclusion criteria: Studies that included school-based interventions; reported adiposity-related data; targeting preschoolers (2 to 5 years old) in rural/low socioeconomic/underserved/areas. Interventions were then described as successful or inconclusive based on the primary outcome. Nine out of the fifteen studies were labeled as successful, which had a reduction in adiposity-related outcomes (BMI (body mass index), BMI z-score, waist circumference, skinfold, percent body fat). Current evidence, although scarce, suggest that obesity outcomes can be targeted in low socioeconomic settings through school interventions with a multicomponent approach (nutrition and physical activity) and the inclusion of parents.

RECENT FINDINGS Partial nephrectomy is the standard treatment for localized kidney tumours. rRAPN is especially useful for kidney tumours of posterior location. It offers advantages such as direct access to the renal artery and no need for bowel mobilization. The disadvantages are the small working space and the less familiar anatomical landmarks. It is a reproducible technique that achieves similar oncological and functional results to the more traditional transperitoneal route (tRAPN). High-quality randomized studies are needed to ascertain the role of new technologies as modern high-flow insufflation systems, intracavitary ultrasound, 3D planning, and augmented reality (AR), in the performance of this operation. rRAPN is especially useful for kidney tumours of posterior location. Robotic surgeons ideally should become familiar with both approaches, transperitoneal or retroperitoneal.","Socarrás, Moises Rodríguez; Elbers, Javier Reinoso; Rivas, Juan Gómez; Autran, Ana Maria; Esperto, Francesco; Tortolero, Leonardo; Carrion, Diego; Sancha, Fernando Gómez",Current urology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-021-01051-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34014412/,250

131331,Clinical ethics during the Covid-19 pandemic: Missing the trees for the forest.,2020-04-30,"Training and education are essential for medical students. During the COVID-19 outbreak, numerous schools and universities have had to close. Ensuring pedagogical continuity requires alternatives to the traditional classroom, especially in medical education. Usual distance learning tools such as videos and downloadable handouts are not sufficient to promote efficient teaching. Distance learning requires self-motivation and does not give you direct access to your instructor. Some students fear the loss of human contact with an instructor - like asking questions during and after class - which promotes learning, understanding and communication. Moreover, classical distance learning methods do not offer immediate feedback that can help students in their understanding of the lecture. In this context, interactive pedagogic tools (IPT) could be useful for medical education continuity and for maintaining human contact necessary in pedagogy. We briefly evaluated interactive pedagogic tool compared to traditionnal distancial tools on medical students. This study showed the importance to have direct contact with a teacher and feedback during a lecture and to not exclusively perform distance learning without direct interaction and feedback. Hence, in the present context, we encourage teacher to use this type of tools to maintain direct interaction with students - which is essential in pedagogy - and ensure a qualitative pedagogical continuity.","Grzych, Guillaume; Schraen-Maschke, Susanna",Annales de biologie clinique,https://doi.org/10.1684/abc.2020.1576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32627731/,250

METHODS Disease Outbreak Response (DORS) measures implemented at our center and its satellite clinics included strict infection prevention, manpower preservation, prudent resource allocation, and adaptation of standard-of-care treatments. Critical day-to-day clinical operations, number of persons screened before entry, staff temperature monitoring, and personal protection equipment stockpile were reviewed as a dashboard at daily DORS taskforce huddles. Polymerase chain reaction swab tests performed for patients and staff who met defined criteria for testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were tracked. Descriptive statistics of outpatient attendances and treatment caseloads from February 3 to May 23, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS We performed COVID-19 swabs for 80 patients and 93 staff, detecting three cancer patients with community-acquired COVID-19 infections with no nosocomial transmission. Patients who required chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery and patients who are on maintenance treatment continued to receive timely treatment without disruption. The number of intravenous chemotherapy treatments was maintained at 97.8% compared with 2019, whereas that of weekly radiotherapy treatments remained stable since December 2019. All cancer-related surgeries proceeded without delay, with a 0.3% increase in workload. Surveillance follow-ups were conducted via teleconsultation, accounting for a 30.7% decrease in total face-to-face clinic consultations. CONCLUSION Through the coordinated efforts of a DORS taskforce, it is possible to avoid nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmissions among patients and staff without compromising on care delivery at a national cancer center.","Kwek, Jin Wei; Chan, Jack J; Kanesvaran, Ravindran; Wang, Michael L C; Neo, Patricia S H; Chia, Claramae S; Tham, Chee Kian; Chew, Lita S T; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Yap, Swee Peng; Dent, Rebecca A; Hwang, William Y K; Lim, Soon Thye",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439694/,250

Clinical evidence from patients with cerebral palsy, who have both decreased serial sarcomere number and reduced satellite cells (SCs), suggests a hypothesis that SCs may be involved in sarcomere addition. METHODS A transgenic Pax7-DTA mouse model underwent conditional SC depletion, and their soleii were then stretch-immobilized to assess the capacity for sarcomere addition. Muscle architecture, morphology, and extracellular matrix (ECM) changes were also evaluated. RESULTS Mice in the SC-reduced group achieved normal serial sarcomere addition in response to stretch. However, muscle fiber cross-sectional area was significantly smaller and was associated with hypertrophic ECM changes, consistent with fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS While a reduced SC population does not hinder serial sarcomere addition, SCs play a role in muscle adaptation to chronic stretch that involves maintenance of both fiber cross-sectional area and ECM structure.

This simple concept resulted in markedly improved efficacy and safety. In an effort to accelerate thrombus dissolution or extraction, mechanical methods were developed, but the initial techniques left substantial residual thrombus that required subsequent catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT). It was soon observed that combined pharmacomechanical thrombolysis was more effective than either one alone. Randomized trials of catheter-based strategies for thrombus removal have documented objective benefit, including improved patency, preserved valve function, and reduced post-thrombotic syndrome. The largest randomized study is the ATTRACT trial published at the end of 2017. Although mild post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) was no different between the pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) and control groups, acute pain and swelling and moderate-to-severe PTS were reduced with PCDT.

Barriers and challenges faced by Brazilian physiotherapists during the COVID-19 pandemic are described, followed by innovative solutions. Remote physiotherapy prior to the pandemic was merely one of many patient care options, but now has become a necessity, and several international organizations have provided guidelines for physiotherapists to follow, including guidelines on offering digital physiotherapy. Related demands, challenges, and perspectives of physiotherapy practice are likely to emerge amid the current uncertainties of the COVID-19 crisis, as well as during the post-pandemic period.

The addition of growth factors has the potential to accelerate tissue integration and enhance scaffold-mediated healing. Growth factor releasing scaffolds face the translational hurdle of limited solubilized protein shelf stability; however, to address this hurdle we present a lyophilized MAP scaffold which can be effectively rehydrated directly prior to use. Our new approach includes a heterogenous MAP scaffold wherein 5% of the microgels contain immobilized heparin loaded with epidermal growth factor (EGF) at 1 μg mL-1. We demonstrate that these scaffolds, which are directly loaded with EGF following lyophilization maintain equivalent properties to scaffolds loaded passively via diffusion into water-swollen microgels, including EGF release profiles and cell migration studies that did not significantly differ. Further, these heterogeneous scaffolds exhibit a significant increase in cellular migration in vitro and quicker re-epithelialization in vivo. This progress on spatially heterogenous growth factor release from MAP scaffolds has great potential to improve complex wound treatment and advance the field of growth factor releasing scaffolds.","Pruett, Lauren; Ellis, Regan; McDermott, Meghan; Roosa, Colleen; Griffin, Donald",Journal of materials chemistry.

However, whether Sesn1 exerts a cytoprotective role in neurons following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury is unknown. The goal of this work was to evaluate the role of Sesn1 in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal injury in vitro. The induction of Sesn1 was found in neurons exposed to OGD/R treatment. The silencing of Sesn1 rendered neurons more vulnerable to OGD/R injury, while the up-regulation of Sesn1 ameliorated OGD/R-induced neuronal injury by reducing apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the up-regulation of Sesn1 promoted the activity of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by down-regulating the expression of the Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). The restoration of Keap1 or the suppression of Nrf2 remarkably abolished the Sesn1-induced neuroprotection effects in OGD/R-exposed neurons. In summary, our work indicates that Sesn1 is a remarkable neuroprotective protein that potentiates Nrf2 activation via Keap1 to ameliorate OGD/R-induced injury.","Yang, Fang; Chen, Ruping",Brain research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2020.147165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069734/,250

WORKING HYPOTHESIS nHFOV improves CO2 removal with respect to nCPAP in preterm infants needing noninvasive respiratory support and persistent oxygen supply after the first 72 h of life. STUDY DESIGN Multicenter non-blinded prospective randomized crossover study. PATIENT SELECTION Thirty premature infants from eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units, of mean ± SD 26.4 ± 1.8 weeks of gestational age and 921 ± 177 g of birth weight. METHODOLOGY Infants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive a starting treatment mode of either nCPAP or nHFOV delivered by the ventilator CNO (Medin, Germany), using short binasal prongs of appropriate size. A crossover design with four 1-h treatment periods was used, such that each infant received both treatments twice. The primary outcome was the mean transcutaneous partial pressure of CO2 (TcCO2 ) value during the 2-h cumulative period of nHFOV compared with the 2-h cumulative period of nCPAP. RESULTS Significantly lower TcCO2 values were observed during nHFOV compared with nCPAP: 47.5 ± 7.6 versus 49.9 ± 7.2 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.0007. A different TcCO2 behavior was found according to the random sequence: in patients starting on nCPAP, TcCO2 significantly decreased from 50.0 ± 8.0 to 46.6 ± 7.5 mmHg during nHFOV (P = 0.001). In patients starting on nHFOV, TcCO2 slightly increased from 48.5 ± 7.8 to 49.9 ± 6.7 mmHg during nCPAP (P = 0.13).

METHODOLOGY The NxTAG RPP was compared to an in-house multiplex real-time PCR panel (LDT) for the detection of respiratory viruses in 314 clinical samples from patients with the symptoms of respiratory infection. RESULTS Thirty-one samples were negative in both tests and 193 samples contained a single virus that was detected in both tests. Polymicrobial infections were detected in 74 samples, with 268 samples overall having concordant results in both assays, and there were a total of 51 discordant results in 44 samples. Two samples were invalid in the NxTAG RPP assay and were excluded from the final analysis. The overall agreement between the NxTAG RPP and LDT was very high, as indicated by the Kappa coefficients, which ranged from 0.85 for metapneumovirus up to 0.96 for RSV A, and the overall percentage agreement values of 96.2 % for enterovirus/rhinovirus and 100 % for influenza A, influenza B, PIV 4 and RSV B. CONCLUSION The NxTAG RPP is a sensitive and specific test for the detection of respiratory viruses and the high sample throughput and low hands-on time make the NxTAG RPP assay suitable for screening clinical samples for respiratory pathogens.","Sails, Andrew David; Eltringham, Gary; Valappil, Manoj; Waugh, Sheila; Saunders, David",Journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.000562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28868996/,250

Whether COVID-19 patients are at high risk of GBS is unknown. Through a systematic review of case reports, we aimed to summarize the main features of patients with GBS and COVID-19. Methods: Without any restrictions, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv (April 23 rd, 2020). Two reviewers screened and studied titles, abstracts and reports. We extracted information to characterize sociodemographic variables, clinical presentation, laboratory results, treatments and outcomes. Results: Eight reports (n=12 patients) of GBS and COVID-19 were identified; one was a Miller Fisher case. The age ranged between 23 and 77 years, and there were more men (9/102). GBS symptoms started between 5 and 24 days after those of COVID-19. The protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid samples ranged between 40 and 193 mg/dl. None of the cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for COVID-19. Six patients debuted with ascendant weakness and three with facial weakness. Five patients had favourable evolution, four remained with relevant symptoms or required critical care and one died; the Miller Fisher case had successful resolution. Conclusions: GBS is emerging as a disease that may appear in COVID-19 patients. Although limited, preliminary evidence appears to suggest that GBS occurs after COVID-19 onset. Practitioners and investigators should have GBS in mind as they look after COVID-19 patients and conduct research on novel aspects of COVID-19. Comparison with GBS patients in the context of another viral outbreak (Zika), revealed similarities and differences that deserves further scrutiny and epidemiological studies.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Altez-Fernandez, Carlos; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Vizcarra, Joaquín A",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15987.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995555/,250

However, early surgical intervention will be beneficial if it is tolerable by the patient. In the surgical approach for treating pneumothorax, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) may reduce the postoperative drainage period and hospital stay compared with open thoracotomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of the clinical data of 40 patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax who underwent open thoracotomy (n = 20) or two-port VATS (n = 20) between January 2008 and December 2012 was performed. RESULTS Postoperative drainage period of open thoracotomy group and two-port VATS group was 9.85 ± 5.28 and 6.75 ± 2.45, respectively, with a significant inter-group difference. Postoperative hospital stay was 11.8 ± 5.12 in the open thoracotomy group and 8.25 ± 2.88 in the two-port VATS group, with a significant inter-group difference. Recurrence rate and postoperative complication rate were not significant between the two groups.

Apart from the paradigm shift introduced by flow diverters, several other devices have seen the light or are under development in order to address these challenges.Areas covered: We performed a review of the novel implantable endovascular devices which have been introduced for the treatment of IAs, from 1 January 2014 to 1 September 2019, excluding classic flow diverter and intracranial stent designs.Expert opinion: Alternative designs have been proposed for the treatment of IAs at branching positions, which do not jail the side branches, with or without flow diversion effect, most of which with good initial outcomes. Endosaccular devices have also been proposed, some of which with lower initial total occlusion rates. Alternative materials such as biopolymers have also been proposed and are under bench research. Despite the challenges in the exploitation of some of the new devices, most of them seem to provide solutions to some current technical shortcomings.

146007,"Building bridges and capacity for Black, Indigenous, and scholars of color in the era of COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter.",2021-06-03,"Infectious Bronchitis (IB) caused by Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is currently a major threat to chicken health with multiple outbreaks being reported in the US over the past decade. Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines used in the field can persist and provide the genetic material needed for recombination and emergence of novel IBV serotypes. Inactivated and subunit vaccines overcome some of the limitations of MLV with no risk of virulence reversion and emergence of new virulent serotypes. However, these vaccines are weakly immunogenic and poorly protective. There is an urgent need to develop more effective vaccines that can elicit a robust, long-lasting immune response. In this study, we evaluate a novel adjuvant system developed from Quil-A and chitosan (QAC) for the intranasal delivery of nucleic acid immunogens to improve protective efficacy. The QAC adjuvant system forms nanocarriers (<100 nm) that efficiently encapsulate nucleic acid cargo, exhibit sustained release of payload and can stably transfect cells. Encapsulation of plasmid DNA vaccine expressing IBV nucleocapsid (N) protein by the QAC adjuvant system (pQAC-N) enhanced immunogenicity as evidenced by robust induction of adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses post vaccination and challenge. Birds immunized with pQAC-N showed reduced clinical severity and viral shedding post challenge on par with protection observed with current commercial vaccines without the associated safety concerns. Presented results indicate that the QAC adjuvant system can offer a safer alternative to the use of live vaccines against avian and other emerging coronaviruses.Importance According to the 2017 US agriculture statistics, the combined value of production and sales from broilers, eggs, turkeys, and chicks was $42.8 billion. Of this number, broiler sales comprised 67 percent of the industry value with the production of > 50 billion pounds of chicken meats. The economic success of the poultry industry in the USA hinges on the extensive use of vaccines to control Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and other poultry pathogens. Majority of vaccines currently licensed for poultry health include both modified live vaccine and inactivated pathogens. Despite their proven efficacy, modified live vaccine constructs take time to produce and could potentially revert to virulence, which limits their safety. The significance of our research stems from the development of a safer and potent alternative mucosal vaccine to replace live vaccines against IBV and other emerging coronaviruses.","Chandrasekar, Shaswath S; Kingstad-Bakke, Brock A; Wu, Chia-Wei; Suresh, M; Talaat, Adel M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01016-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669327/,250

As clinicians, we distinguish one form of vasculitis from another on the basis of observed patterns of organ injury, the size of the vessels affected and histopathological findings. The terms 'small-vessel', 'medium-vessel' and 'large-vessel' vasculitis are useful clinical descriptors, but fail to inform us about why vessels of a certain calibre are favoured by one disease and not another. Classification based on vessel size also fails to consider that vessels of a specific calibre are not equally prone to injury. Distinct vulnerabilities undoubtedly relate to the fact that same-size vessels in different tissues may not be identical conduits. In fact, vessels become specialized, from the earliest stages of embryonic development, to suit the needs of different anatomical locations. Vessels of the same calibre in different locations and organs are as different as the organ parenchymal cells through which they travel. The dialogue between developing vessels and the tissues they perfuse is designed to meet special local needs. Added to the story of vascular diversity and vulnerability are changes that occur during growth, development and ageing. An improved understanding of the unique territorial vulnerabilities of vessels could form the basis of new hypotheses for the aetiopathogenesis of the vasculitides. This Review considers how certain antigens, including infectious agents, might become disease-relevant and how vascular diversity could influence disease phenotypes and the spectrum of vascular inflammatory diseases.","Hoffman, Gary S; Calabrese, Leonard H",Nature reviews.

148942,Nursing Education: challenges and perspectives in a COVID-19 age.,2020,"PURPOSE We calculated the dosimetric indices and estimated the tumor control probability (TCP) considering six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) patient setup errors in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using a single-isocenter technique. METHODS We used simulated spherical gross tumor volumes (GTVs) with diameters of 1.0 cm (GTV 1), 2.0 cm (GTV 2), and 3.0 cm (GTV 3), and the distance (d) between the target center and isocenter was set to 0, 5, and 10 cm. We created the dose distribution by convolving the blur component to uniform dose distribution. The prescription dose was 20 Gy and the dose distribution was adjusted so that D95 (%) of each GTV was covered by 100% of the prescribed dose. The GTV was simultaneously rotated within 0°-1.0° (δR) around the x-, y-, and z-axes and then translated within 0-1.0 mm (δT) in the x-, y-, and z-axis directions. D95, conformity index (CI), and conformation number (CN) were evaluated by varying the distance from the isocenter. The TCP was estimated by translating the calculated dose distribution into a biological response. In addition, we derived the x-y-z coordinates with the smallest TCP reduction rate that minimize the sum of squares of the residuals as the optimal isocenter coordinates using the relationship between 6DoF setup error, distance from isocenter, and GTV size. RESULTS D95, CI, and CN were decreased with increasing isocenter distance, decreasing GTV size, and increasing setup error. TCP of GTVs without 6DoF setup error was estimated to be 77.0%. TCP were 25.8% (GTV 1), 35.0% (GTV 2), and 53.0% (GTV 3) with (d, δT, δR) = (10 cm, 1.0 mm, 1.0°). The TCP was 52.3% (GTV 1), 54.9% (GTV 2), and 66.1% (GTV 3) with (d, δT, δR) = (10 cm, 1.0 mm, 1.0°) at the optimal isocenter position. CONCLUSION The TCP in SRS for multiple brain metastases with a single-isocenter technique may decrease with increasing isocenter distance and decreasing GTV size when the 6DoF setup errors are exceeded (1.0 mm, 1.0°). Additionally, it might be possible to better maintain TCP for GTVs with 6DoF setup errors by using the optimal isocenter position.","Nakano, Hisashi; Tanabe, Satoshi; Sasamoto, Ryuta; Takizawa, Takeshi; Utsunomiya, Satoru; Sakai, Madoka; Nakano, Toshimichi; Ohta, Atsushi; Kaidu, Motoki; Ishikawa, Hiroyuki",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.13322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151498/,250

PATIENTS AND METHODS From September 2009 to December 2010, 18 consecutive patients with a solitary renal tumor underwent transumbilical LESS-RN. We grouped measured parameters on the basis of the first nine (group A) and last nine (group B) patients, and compared both subgroups with the control group (C), which was composed of the initial nine consecutive patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic RNs performed by the same surgeon. RESULTS There was one LESS patient converted to conventional laparoscopic surgery for intraoperative hemorrhage and transfused. The mean for measured parameters of the groups A, B, C were: age: 58.6, 57.2, and 59.2 years, respectively (P>0.05); American Society of Aneshesiologists score: 1.9, 2.0, and 2.0, respectively (P>0.05); body mass index: 25.2, 23.5, and 23.1 kg/m(2), respectively (P>0.05); lesion size at CT scan: 5.0, 4.6, and 6.2 cm, respectively (P=0.039); operative skin to skin time: 191.6, 123.9, and 122.2 minutes, respectively (P=0.000); estimated blood loss: 172.2, 246.7, and 116.7 mL, respectively (P>0.05); incision length: 5.6, 5.9, and 7.4 cm, respectively (P=0.000); hospital stay: 5.8, 5.8, and 5.8 days, respectively (P>0.05).

150285,Where Do We Go From Here? The Delivery of Addiction Treatment in a Post-COVID World.,2021-03-04,"SUMMARY STATEMENTS (1) Peritoneal dialysis (PD) should be considered a suitable modality for treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in all settings (1B). GUIDELINE 2: ACCESS AND FLUID DELIVERY FOR ACUTE PD IN ADULTS (2.1) Flexible peritoneal catheters should be used where resources and expertise exist (1B) (optimal).(2.2) Rigid catheters and improvised catheters using nasogastric tubes and other cavity drainage catheters may be used in resource-poor environments where they may still be life-saving (1C) (minimum standard).(2.3) We recommend catheters should be tunnelled to reduce peritonitis and peri-catheter leak (practice point).(2.4) We recommend that the method of catheter implantation should be based on patient factors and locally available skills (1C).(2.5) PD catheter implantation by appropriately trained nephrologists in patients without contraindications is safe and functional results equate to those inserted surgically (1B).(2.6) Nephrologists should receive training and be permitted to insert PD catheters to ensure timely dialysis in the emergency setting (practice point). (2.7) We recommend, when available, percutaneous catheter insertion by a nephrologist should include assessment with ultrasonography (2C).(2.8) Insertion of PD catheter should take place under complete aseptic conditions using sterile technique (practice point).(2.9) We recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to PD catheter implantation (1B).(2.10) A closed delivery system with a Y connection should be used (1A) (optimal). In resource poor areas, spiking of bags and makeshift connections may be necessary and can be considered (minimum standard).(2.11) The use of automated or manual PD exchanges are acceptable and this will be dependent on local availability and practices (practice point). GUIDELINE 3: PERITONEAL DIALYSIS SOLUTIONS FOR ACUTE PD (3.1) In patients who are critically ill, especially those with significant liver dysfunction and marked elevation of lactate levels, bicarbonate containing solutions should be used (1B) (optimal). Where these solutions are not available, the use of lactate containing solutions is an alternative (practice point) (minimum standard).(3.2) Commercially prepared solutions should be used (optimal). However, where resources do not permit this, then locally prepared fluids may be life-saving and with careful observation of sterile preparation procedure, peritonitis rates are not increased (1C) (minimum standard).(3.3) Once potassium levels in the serum fall below 4 mmol/L, potassium should be added to dialysate (using strict sterile technique to prevent infection) or alternatively oral or intravenous potassium should be given to maintain potassium levels at 4 mmol/L or above (1C).(3.4) Potassium levels should be measured daily (optimal). Where these facilities do not exist, we recommend that after 24 h of successful dialysis, one consider adding potassium chloride to achieve a concentration of 4 mmol/L in the dialysate (minimum standard) (practice point). GUIDELINE 4: PRESCRIBING AND ACHIEVING ADEQUATE CLEARANCE IN ACUTE PD (4.1) Targeting a weekly K t/V urea of 3.5 provides outcomes comparable to that of daily HD in critically ill patients; targeting higher doses does not improve outcomes (1B). This dose may not be necessary for most patients with AKI and targeting a weekly K t/V of 2.2 has been shown to be equivalent to higher doses (1B). Tidal automated PD (APD) using 25 L with 70% tidal volume per 24 h shows equivalent survival to continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration with an effluent dose of 23 mL/kg/h (1C).(4.2) Cycle times should be dictated by the clinical circumstances. Short cycle times (1-2 h) are likely to more rapidly correct uraemia, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and/or metabolic acidosis; however, they may be increased to 4-6 hourly once the above are controlled to reduce costs and facilitate clearance of larger sized solutes (2C).(4.3) The concentration of dextrose should be increased and cycle time reduced to 2 hourly when fluid overload is evident. Once the patient is euvolemic, the dextrose concentration and cycle time should be adjusted to ensure a neutral fluid balance (1C).(4.4) Where resources permit, creatinine, urea, potassium and bicarbonate levels should be measured daily; 24 h K t/V urea and creatinine clearance measurement is recommended to assess adequacy when clinically indicated (practice point).(4.5) Interruption of dialysis should be considered once the patient is passing >1 L of urine/24 h and there is a spontaneous reduction in creatinine (practice point). The use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) to treat patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has become more popular among clinicians following evidence of similar outcomes when compared with other extracorporeal therapies. Although it has been extensively used in low-resource environments for many years, there is now a renewed interest in the use of PD to manage patients with AKI (including patients in intensive care units) in higher income countries. Here we present the update of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis guidelines for PD in AKI. These guidelines extensively review the available literature and present updated recommendations regarding peritoneal access, dialysis solutions and prescription of dialysis with revised targets of solute clearance.","Cullis, Brett; Al-Hwiesh, Abdullah; Kilonzo, Kajiru; McCulloch, Mignon; Niang, Abdou; Nourse, Peter; Parapiboon, Watanyu; Ponce, Daniela; Finkelstein, Fredric O",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1177/0896860820970834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33267747/,250
151964,Covid-19: Brazil breaks record daily death toll as crisis spreads through South America.,2021-04-08,"AIM To investigate the safety and feasibility of needlescopic grasper-assisted single-incision laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (nSIL-CBDE) by comparing the surgical outcomes of this technique with those of conventional laparoscopic CBDE (CL-CBDE). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients who underwent CL-CBDE or nSIL-CBDE for the treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones between January 2000 and December 2014. For performing nSIL-CBDE, a needlescopic grasper was also inserted through a direct puncture below the right subcostal line after introducing a single-port through the umbilicus. The needlescopic grasper helped obtain the critical view of safety by retracting the gallbladder laterally and by preventing crossing or conflict between laparoscopic instruments. The gallbladder was then partially dissected from the liver bed and used for retraction. CBD stones were usually extracted through a longitudinal supraduodenal choledochotomy, mostly using ﬂushing a copious amount of normal saline through a ureteral catheter. Afterward, for the certification of CBD clearance, CBDE was performed mostly using a ﬂexible choledochoscope. The choledochotomy site was primarily closed without using a T-tube, and simultaneous cholecystectomies were performed. RESULTS During the study period, 40 patients underwent laparoscopic CBDE. Of these patients, 20 underwent CL-CBDE and 20 underwent nSIL-CBDE. The operative time for nSIL-CBDE was significantly longer than that for CL-CBDE (238 ± 76 min vs 192 ± 39 min, P = 0.007). The stone clearance rate was 100% (40/40) in both groups. Postoperatively, the nSIL-CBDE group required less intravenous analgesic (pethidine) (46.5 ± 63.5 mg/kg vs 92.5 ± 120.1 mg/kg, P = 0.010) and had a shorter hospital stay than the CL-CBDE group (3.8 ± 2.0 d vs 5.1 ± 1.7 d, P = 0.010). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that nSIL-CBDE could be safe and feasible while improving cosmetic outcomes when performed by surgeons trained in conventional laparoscopic techniques.","Kim, Say-June; Kim, Kee-Hwan; An, Chang-Hyeok; Kim, Jeong-Soo",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v21.i45.12857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26668510/,250

The learning curve is defined by complications and/or by duration of surgery (DOS). Previous studies report an inverse relationship between patient outcome and patient volume. In this study, we investigate whether the learning curve of preceding bariatric surgeons is of additional influence for surgeons who start to perform LRYGB in the same centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analysed the records of all 713 consecutive primary LRYGB patients operated in our centre from December 2007 until July 2012. Surgeon 1 and 3 had previous laparoscopic bariatric experience whilst Surgeon 2 and 4 had not. We stratified the data between the four surgeons with different levels of experience and in a chronology of 50 cases. RESULTS Sixty-seven (9.4 %) complications occurred in the study period. Surgeon 1 had more complications occurring within the first 50 cases than Surgeon 4 (10 versus 1, p < 0.05). There was no difference in complication rate between groups of 50 consecutive cases. None of the patients died. DOS decreased for every consecutive surgeon, irrespective of their experience. The learning curve defined by DOS was steepest for Surgeon 1, followed by Surgeon 2, 3 and 4. CONCLUSION In this study, we show that the learning curve of the preceding surgeon positively influences the learning curve of latter surgeons, irrespective of their experience. Therefore, the 'preceding surgeon factor' should be taken in account in addition to volume requirements when starting new bariatric facilities.","Geubbels, Noëlle; de Brauw, L Maurits; Acherman, Yair I Z; van de Laar, Arnold W J M; Wouters, Michel W J M; Bruin, Sjoerd C",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1538-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25511752/,250

After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), infection site, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, use of vasoactive drugs, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy (RRT), hematocrit, albumin, procalcitonin (PCT), and lactate, logistic regression analysis revealed that an MPV-CV ≥ 15.00% + NEU%-CV ≥ 16.00% was an independent predictive factor for in-hospital mortality [adjusted model: odds ratio (OR) = 4.48, 95% CI = 2.92-6.88, P = 0.001]. RESULTS After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, infection site, APACHE II score, SOFA score, hematocrit, albumin, PCT, lactate, and the use of vasoactive drugs, mechanical ventilation, and RRT, Cox proportional-hazards regression model revealed that an MPV-CV ≥ 15.00% + NEU%-CV ≥ 16.00% was an independent predictive factor for 30-day mortality [adjusted model 1: hazard ratio (HR) = 7.69, 95 % CI = 4.15-14.24, P < 0.001; adjusted model 2: HR = 4.07, 95% CI = 2.50-6.62, P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION The combination of MPV-CV and NEU%-CV provides a good prognostic value and is a strong independent predictor of short-term clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. An MPV-CV ≥ 15.00% + NEU%-CV ≥ 16.00% is significantly associated with adverse short-term clinical outcomes.

154644,Medical doctors in India are on strike: a moral and national conundrum.,2020-11-24,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic hernioplasty has been gaining its popularity in the past decade for its rapid recovery. Single-incision surgery, as its possible advancement, has also received more attention. Traditional laparoscopic surgery with carbon dioxide insufflation precluded patients with underlying cardiovascular or pulmonary disease from minimal invasive surgery. We report our early experience with gasless single-incision laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair via totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach. METHODS Between 2010 and 2012, 15 consecutive patients underwent gasless laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by the same surgeon, using abdominal wall lifting technique with a self-tailored device. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operative findings and postoperative outcomes were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS Of the 15 patients, all had unilateral hernia. Two presented with acute incarceration, in which one required bowel resection. There was no conversion to open surgery or insertion of additional ports. The median operating time was 80 min (range 51-130) for elective repair and 178 min (range 135-220) for emergency repair. The median hospital stay was 1 day (range 1-6) with minimal requirement of analgesics. Median time taken to resume normal activity was 2 days (range 1-6). No major medical complications or mesh infection was encountered. One patient developed hematoma and was successfully managed by salvage laparoscopic reoperation. During a median follow-up of 54 months (range 38-60), none experienced recurrence. CONCLUSION Gasless single-incision TEP is feasible with favorable results, even in high-risk patients with compromised cardiorespiratory status. This technique can also be applied to emergency setting in patients with incarcerated inguinal hernia requiring bowel resection. Future large scale randomized study is needed to verify the effectiveness of this technique.","Ng, M W V; Ng, K C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-017-1637-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28808824/,250

154807,"Covid-19: Prepare for a third wave, warns England's chief medical officer.",2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND Appendicitis is the most common surgical condition in pediatric emergency department (ED) patients. Prompt diagnosis can reduce morbidity, including appendiceal perforation. The goal of this study was to measure racial/ethnic differences in rates of: 1) appendiceal perforation; 2) delayed diagnosis of appendicitis; 3) diagnostic imaging during prior visit(s). METHODS 3-year multicenter (7 EDs) retrospective cohort study of children diagnosed with appendicitis using the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Registry. Delayed diagnosis was defined as having at least one prior ED visit within 7 days preceding appendicitis diagnosis. We performed multivariable logistic regression to measure associations of race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic [NH]-white, NH-Black, Hispanic, Other) with: 1) appendiceal perforation; 2) delayed diagnosis of appendicitis; 3) diagnostic imaging during prior visit(s). RESULTS Of 7298 patients with appendicitis and documented race/ethnicity, 2567 (35.2%) had appendiceal perforation. In comparison to NH-whites, NH-Black children had higher likelihood of perforation (36.5% vs. 34.9%; aOR 1.21 [95% CI 1.01, 1.45]). 206 (2.8%) had a delayed diagnosis of appendicitis. NH-Black children were more likely to have delayed diagnoses (4.7% vs. 2.0%; aOR 1.81 [1.09, 2.98]. Eighty-nine (43.2%) patients with delayed diagnosis had abdominal imaging during their prior visits. In comparison to NH-whites, NH-Black children were less likely to undergo any imaging (28.2% vs. 46.2%; aOR 0.41 [0.18, 0.96]), or definitive imaging (e.g. US/CT/MRI) (10.3% vs. 35.9%; aOR 0.15 [0.05, 0.50]) during prior visits. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter cohort, there were racial disparities in appendiceal perforation. There were also racial disparities in rates of delayed diagnosis of appendicitis and diagnostic imaging during prior ED visits. These disparities in diagnostic imaging may lead to delays in appendicitis diagnosis, and thus, may contribute to higher perforation rates demonstrated among minority children.","Goyal, Monika K; Chamberlain, James M; Webb, Michael; Grundmeier, Robert W; Johnson, Tiffani J; Lorch, Scott A; Zorc, Joseph J; Alessandrini, Evaline; Bajaj, Lalit; Cook, Lawrence; Alpern, Elizabeth R",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991770/,250
157133,How social intimidation interferred with the increasing number of improper accesses at the E.R.: a first-month COVID19 outbreak evaluation.,2021-03-15,"INTRODUCTION Little is known about oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) levels in the cerebral tissue during the development of anoxic and ischemic brain injury. We hypothesized that the estimated cerebral oxy-Hb level, a product of Hb and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2), determined at hospital arrival may reflect the level of neuroprotection in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). METHODS The Japan Prediction of neurological Outcomes in patients with Post cardiac arrest (J-POP) registry is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study to test whether rSO2 predicts neurological outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study assessed a subgroup of consecutive patients who fulfilled the J-POP registry criteria and successfully achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from OHCA. The primary outcome measure was the neurological status at 90 days. RESULTS We analyzed data from 495 consecutive comatose survivors who were successfully resuscitated from OHCA, including 119 comatose patients with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC; 24.0%) and 376 cardiac arrests at hospital arrival. In total, 75 patients (15.1%) presented with good neurological outcomes. Univariate analysis revealed that the cerebral oxy-Hb levels were significantly higher in patients with good outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression using the backward elimination method confirmed that the oxy-Hb level was a significant predictor of good neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio: 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 1.46). Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) revealed that an oxy-Hb cut-off of 5.5 provided optimal sensitivity and specificity for predicting good neurological outcomes (AUC: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.91; sensitivity: 77.3%; specificity: 85.6%). The oxy-Hb level appeared to be an excellent prognostic indicator with significant advantages over rSO2 and base excess according to AUC analysis. The significant trend for good neurological outcomes was consistent, even in the subgroup of patients who achieved return of spontaneous circulation upon hospital arrival (1st quartile: 0%; 2nd quartile: 16.7%; 3rd quartile: 29.4%; 4th quartile: 53.3%, P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS The cerebral oxy-Hb level may predict neurological outcomes and is a simple and excellent indicator of neuroprotection in patients with PCAS.

157562,How junior doctors perceive personalised yoga and group exercise in the management of occupational and traumatic stressors.,2021-03-09,"Background Tattooing is increasingly common among adolescents and young adults. This study explores the clinical efficacy of picosecond laser for the correction of tattoos. Literature suggests that 25-47% of the population have had a tattoo at some point in their life (1). The incidence is slightly higher in adults 18-35 years (22-47%) compared to college students (18-25 years of age(1, 2). Recent surveys report 25% of tattooed adults expressing regret, while 4% of tattooed students had already undergone some form of tattoo-removal procedure (3). A common request for tattoo removal includes poorly executed tattoos, avoidance of stigmatization, trauma, socially inappropriate, and employment. Several procedures have been proposed to remove tattoos including cryosurgery, thermal cautery, or surgical resection (4). A major disadvantage of these methods is that they are all highly operator dependent, and carry a very high risk of residual scarring, residual pigment being left behind ""ghosting"" (3). In addition, some opt to cover the unwanted tattoo with another design, which results in layered tattoos that are substantially harder to manage. Laser surgery, in skilled hands, is an effective method for tattoo removal and traditionally, this is performed with Quality-Switched Laser, where energy liberatred in the nanosecond range results in a selective photothermal effect (5). Picosecond laser is a more recent innovation that results in energy released in a picosecond timescale (a time interval 1000 times shorter). One potential disavantage of laser therapy for the effacement of cutaneous tattoos is the length of treatment and associated cost, which might dissuade the patient from following through to completion of treatment, limiting potential benefits whilst still being exposed to risk of harm. (5, 6). Recent studies suggest that picosecond laser result in substantially reduced treatment times, whilst achieving an identical or more effective end result (7-9). However, these studies are limited by very small sample size and follow-up.","Pedrelli, Valerio; Azzopardi, Elayne; Azzopardi, Ernest; Tretti Clementoni, Matteo",Journal of cosmetic and laser therapy : official publication of the European Society for Laser Dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/14764172.2021.1886307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594939/,250

Rehabilitation Units have a crucial role in reducing disability in order to reintroduce patients in the community. AIM To characterize pulmonary function and disability status and to propose an early rehabilitation protocol in a cohort of post-acute COVID-19 patients admitted to an Italian Rehabilitation Unit. DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING Inpatients Rehabilitation Unit. POPULATION Post-acute COVID-19 patients. METHODS Demographic, anamnestic and clinical characteristics, laboratory exams and medical imaging findings were collected for the entire cohort. Outcome measures evaluated at the admission in Rehabilitation Unit were: type of respiratory supports needed, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), FIO2/PaO2, Barthel Index (BI), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale, and 6-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT). Furthermore, we proposed an early rehabilitation protocol for COVID-19 patients based on baseline FiO2. RESULTS We included 32 post-acute COVID-19 patients (22 male and 10 female), mean aged 72.6 ± 10.9 years. BI was 45.2±27.6, with patients in need of higher FIO2 (≥ 40%) showing lower values: 39.6 ± 25.7 vs 53.3 ± 29.3. All patients had grade 4 or 5 on the mMRC Dyspnoea Scale. Only 14 COVID-19 patients were able to walk (43.7%). 6-MWT was feasible in 6 (18.8%) patients with a mean distance of 45.0±100.6 meters. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our findings suggest that post-acute COVID-19 patients suffered from dyspnoea and shortness of breath even for minimal activities, with a resulting severe disability, and only a few of them were able to perform 6-MWT with poor results. An early rehabilitation protocol was proposed according to the baseline conditions of the patients.

To this end, we determined the concentration of lead in the kidney, liver, and stomach contents of 133 Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) captured in the Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin (Buenos Aires, Argentina). This basin is one of the most severe cases of water pollution in Latin America and metals like lead represent the most common chemical pollutants. Rats were trapped in nine sites with different soil and water lead concentrations, between 2014 and 2015. A positive relationship was found between lead concentration in the liver and kidney of R. norvegicus and the environmental concentration of this metal in water and soil. Although the remaining variables analyzed were also related to the lead concentration in soft tissues, they did not affect the association between the lead concentration in soft tissues and that in the environment. The lead concentration in the stomach contents was not related to any of the variables analyzed. Our results constitute the first study in an urban basin with a gradient of environmental lead concentration and suggest that the quantification of lead in the kidney and liver of rats can be used as an indicator of exposure to this metal within a large city.","Tripodi, Mariel A; Muschetto, Emiliano; Cueto, Gerardo; Hancke, Diego; Suárez, Olga",Environmental monitoring and assessment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08300-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388837/,250

This risk is reduced by closure and resection. To address the efficacy of surgical LAA closure, resilience to pneumatic pressure was studied. Different surgical techniques were compared in an experimental model. METHODS From freshly slaughtered pigs cardiopulmonary preparations were taken. The left atrium was clamped airtight and the LAA was cannulated. Via a manually operated pump pressure was applied and a digital pressure gauge was connected. Four groups (each n=12) with different epicardial closures were studied: (I) purse string; (II) single layered continuous suture; (III) double layered suture; (IV) surgical stapler. A nonparametric test was used for group comparisons of mean burst pressures (mmHg). Statistical significance was defined at P<0.05. RESULTS Mean burst pressures in group 1 amounted to 97.1±13.0 mmHg, in group 2 to 105.5±13.3 mmHg, in group 3 to 124.6±14.2 mmHg and in group 4 to 136.6±12.5 mmHg. Excepting differences between groups 1 and 2 comparisons between groups were significantly different. CONCLUSIONS In an ex vivo model surgical staplers and double layered hand crafted sutures proved well suitable for closure of the LAA. They were significantly superior to single layered sutures in terms of resilience to pneumatic pressure.

A number of studies have used such recordings for analysis, even though information about bandwidth and fidelity has not been provided by the manufacturers. In this study we consider these systems purely as EEG recording devices, and evaluate their suitability for quantitative analysis. Using a calibrated electronic testing system, we played an artificial test signal of known amplitude with frequency varying from 0.01 to 400 Hz into the BIS and Entropy EEG systems, and saved the recording in each of their supported recording modes. The amplitude of the recording at each frequency was then used to derive the frequency response curves, as well as the 3 dB and 0.5 dB points for each mode. There are important differences between the various BIS and Entropy recordings. The BIS 256 Hz and the Entropy 400 Hz recordings are broadly comparable, although Entropy has a slightly reduced response above 50 Hz and below 1 Hz. The BIS 128 Hz recording has a somewhat reduced bandwidth, due to its relatively low sampling rate. The Entropy 100 Hz recording in the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 monitor has a flawed implementation, leading to aliasing of signals over 50 Hz and potential distortion of the recording, while in the GE Carescape it has an uneven response and a narrowed bandwidth. Consequently, it is important to know which specific host monitor was used when an Entropy 100 Hz recording was made. In summary, the choice of recording device and host monitor may affect the results of some quantitative EEG analysis, and some previously published studies may need to be re-evaluated.","Schuller, Peter J; Pretorius, Jan P G; Newbery, Kym B",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-021-00694-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860876/,250

162841,Assessment of online physiotherapy consultation for children - Parents' opinions,2021,"Approximately 40,000 women die from breast cancer each year in the United States, highlighting the importance of identifying high-risk women prior to breast cancer development. Risk models exist, including the Tyrer-Cusick (TC) model but have not been widely implemented due to the time required to perform the risk assessment and interpret results. We aim to report our experience with a web-based application (WBA) to complete the TC model for women prior to a scheduled gynecologic oncology clinic visit. All patients scheduled for a gynecologic oncology new patient appointment between 9/2020-9/2021 were offered enrollment in an institutional review board-approved prospective trial. Patients were randomized to standard of care gynecologic oncology visit versus utilization of a WBA completed either at home or in the office prior to the appointment (randomized 1:1:1). The WBA collects personal and family health history and utilizes this information to generate a TC score. As part of the trial protocol, all women with a TC score reflecting a lifetime risk of breast cancer ≥ 20% were referred to the institution's high risk breast clinic which provides counseling on genetic testing, breast screening and breast cancer prevention. The WBA also generated additional information on personal and family cancer, the results of which are reported separately. Sixty-six patients were randomized to utilization of the WBA which included completion of the TC model. Median patient age was 60 (range 22-88). Twenty-six patients (39.4%) did not complete the model for the following reasons: 13 (50%) were not able to access the application, 11 (42.3%) did not answer all required questions and 4 (15.4%) were ineligible due to prior breast cancer. Forty patients (60.6%) successfully completed the TC model and among those patients, 6 (15%) had a significantly elevated lifetime breast cancer risk score (defined as ≥ 20%), all of whom were referred to a high risk breast clinic. The COVID-19 pandemic has pressed the healthcare system to better utilize technology to provide safe and equitable medical care. A WBA for collection of personal and family health history and generation of cancer risk models completed prior to the physician appointment is an exciting application of such technology. When piloted in a gynecologic oncology practice, 60.6% of patients were able to complete the risk model and 15% of these patients were found to have a significantly elevated breast cancer risk warranting follow-up care.

Has technology reached the point of perfection, when it comes to replicating face-to-face activities? This article focuses on the analysis of factors that may influence the experience of playing in physical casinos vs. betting on online casinos. The goal is to understand the extent to which technology was able to reproduce this activity and concerning which points does it fail. We also assess which of the two activities players feel most comfortable with, where they spend more money, where they feel like betting more often, among others. To this end, we performed an analysis of articles, a survey (with 100 responses), and seven interviews with regular casino gamblers, which allowed conclusions to be drawn on the theme. Chi-square tests were performed on the survey data, but no statistically significant associations were found. The results of our survey show a slight increase in the need to gamble due to the pandemic, which is in line with previous research. Despite the accessibility of online games, there are factors that lag behind, such as the fact that people have more fun in physical casinos. However, online casinos make people bet more money because they are not so aware of the money they are spending and because they are in the comfort of their home, away from negative looks. © 2021 AISTI.","De Sousa Lobo, A.

Objectives: To assess the risk factors for hospitalization with COVID-19 in patients with AIRD Methods: A single centre retrospective observational study including patients with AIRD who had contracted COVID-19. Data was collected from all patients attending our clinic from September 2020 to January 2021. Patients with COVID-19 were divided into hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups. Clinical, demographic, ongoing medications, comorbidities and post COVID flare data were collected and analysed using crosstabs-chi square and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: 520 patients with AIRD were screened over the study duration, of which 52 patients who had contracted COVID-19 were included in the study. Amongst them, 19 patients (36.5%) required hospitalization. The common symptoms in the hospitalized patients over non-hospitalized were fever (63.2% vs 57.6), fatigue (42.1% vs 21.2%), headache (36.8% vs 18.2%), abdominal pain (26.3% vs 6.1%), myalgias (36.8 vs 18.2%) and dyspnea (31.6% vs 18.2%). The most common rheumatic conditions seen in both the groups were RA (42.1% vs 30.3%), SPA (26.3% vs 36.4%), and SLE with other CTD's (15.8% vs 24.2%). 6 patients (11.5%) required ICU stay, 3 patients (5.7%) were ventilated, and 2 (3.8%) patients died. Patients requiring hospitalization were aged ≥50 years (p=0.018), had DM type II (p=0.003), HTN (p=0.035), multimorbidity (p=0.021), and a higher CORAD score (p<0.001). Usage of CsDMARDS, bDMARDS, TsDMARDS, corticosteroids did not show a significant difference between both the groups. Patients with ≥2 years of disease duration required hospitalization in comparison to <2 years of duration but this was not statistically significant. 84.2% of hospitalized and 69.7% of non-hospitalized patients stopped anti-rheumatic treatment and disease flare was seen in 47.4% and 39.4% patients respectively. Conclusion: The rheumatic disease and their medications did not increase the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization in this study. However, higher age, DM II, HTN, and high CORAD score were found to be associated with hospitalization in AIRD patients. The findings of this study are limited by a small sample size.","Mn, J.; Dekate, P.; Vontari, S.; Dudam, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3137,250

Traditionally, neurofeedback has been used to complement interventions for various neuropsychological disorders through techniques like frequency training, which attempts to change the power ratio of certain EEG frequency bands. However, to date, there are no neurofeedback approaches that look directly into modulating the neural entrainment to speech. Speech-brain entrainment, which stands for the alignment of the neural activity to the envelope of the speech input, has been shown to be key to speech comprehension. In fact, atypical neural entrainment to speech seems to be consistently found in language development disorders such as dyslexia. Thus, making speech entrainment neurofeedback a promising technique to obtain behavioral improvements. In this work, we present the first open-source brain-computer interface system that can be reliably used to provide speech entrainment neurofeedback while still being flexible enough to deliver more traditional coherence-based neurofeedback. In addition, it has the potential of being an open-source alternative to deliver other types of neurofeedback if configured to do so.","Carrera Arias, Francisco Javier; Molinaro, Nicola; Lizarazu, Mikel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.440176,250

This study aimed to assess food security status of adults in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 curfew, and describe their coping strategies, eating habits, and health conditions. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey, which included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, food security status, coping strategies, eating habits and self-rated health. Results: A total of 605 adults living in Saudi Arabia were recruited through an online survey. The overall prevalence of food insecurity was 28.4% (n= 172). Food insecurity was significantly higher among males with lower education and income level, and in participants living in rented properties. Numerous coping strategies were found to be significantly different between four types of food security groups. The total score of coping strategies was negatively associated with food security status (0.94±1.59, 2.78±2.44, 6.43±2.76, 7.34 ± 2.20, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Food-insecure participants were significantly more likely to report poor/fair physical and mental health, compared to food-secure participants (p&lt; 0.001).

The widespread use of masks has resulted in global shortages and individuals are reusing them. This calls for proper disinfection of the masks while retaining their protective capability. In this study, the killing efficiency of ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation, dry heat, and steam sterilization against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), fungi (Candida albicans), and nonpathogenic virus (Salmonella virus P22) is investigated. UV-C irradiation for 10 min in a commercial UV sterilizer effectively disinfects surgical masks. N95 respirators require dry heat at 100 degrees C for hours while steam treatment works within 5 min. To address the question on safe reuse of the disinfected masks, their bacteria filtration efficiency, particle filtration efficiency, breathability, and fluid resistance are assessed. These performance factors are unaffected after 5 cycles of steam (10 min per cycle) and 10 cycles of dry heat at 100 degrees C (40 min per cycle) for N95 respirators, and 10 cycles of UV-C irradiation for surgical masks (10 min per side per cycle).

Trainees creating a novel foundation interim Year 1 (FiY1) programme at South Tees NHS foundation trust,2020,"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown to be effective in preventing hospitalization for severe COVID-19. However, multiple reports of break-through infections and of waning antibody titers have raised concerns on the durability of the vaccine, and current discussions on vaccination strategies are centered on evaluating the opportunity of a third dose administration. Here, we monitored T cell responses to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in 71 healthy donors vaccinated with the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) for up to 6 months after vaccination. We find that vaccination induces the development of a sustained anti-viral memory T cell response which includes both the CD4+ and the CD8+ lymphocyte subsets. These lymphocytes display markers of polyfunctionality, are fit for interaction with cognate cells, show features of memory stemness, and survive in significant numbers the physiological contraction of the immune response. Collectively, this data shows that vaccination with BNT162b2 elicits an immunologically competent and potentially long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell population. Understanding the immune responses to BNT162b2 provides insights on the immunological basis of the clinical efficacy of the current vaccination campaign and may instruct future vaccination strategies.","Guerrera, Gisella; Picozza, Mario; D’Orso, Silvia; Placido, Roberta; Pirronello, Marta; Verdiani, Alice; Termine, Andrea; Fabrizio, Carlo; Giannessi, Flavia; Sambucci, Manolo; Balice, Maria Pia; Caltagirone, Carlo; Salvia, Antonino; Rossini, Angelo; Battistini, Luca; Borsellino, Giovanna",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.462006,250

Increased frequency of immature CD10neg neutrophils and elevated circulating levels of IFN-γ were linked, mainly in cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive patients with high anti-CMV antibody titers and expanded CD4+CD28null T-cells. At a mechanistic level, CD10neg neutrophils enhance IFN-γ production by CD4+ T-cells through induction of interleukin-12. Moreover, we showed that HLA-DRneg/low monocytes are not immunosuppressive but secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after differentiation to macrophages and IFN-γ stimulation. Thus, the immunoregulatory functions of immature CD10neg neutrophils play a dynamic role in mechanisms linking myeloid cell compartment dysregulation, Th1-type immune responses and inflammation in patients with AMI.","Fraccarollo, Daniela; Neuser, Jonas; Möller, Julian; Riehle, Christian; Galuppo, Paolo; Bauersachs, Johann",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.21.306118,250

Antigen-specific B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were characterized, and T cells were interrogated for functionality at late convalescence. Anti-spike (S) antibody titers decreased over time, but effector functions mediated by S-specific antibodies remained stable. S- and nucleocapsid (N)-specific B cells could be detected in late convalescence in the activated memory B cell compartment and are mostly IgG+.

Platelets are essential for haemostasis but also contribute to thrombosis when activated pathologically. We hypothesised that an increase in BMI may lead to changes in platelet characteristics, thereby contributing to increased thrombotic risk. The effect of BMI on platelet traits measured by Sysmex XN-1000 was explored in 33388 UK blood donors from the INTERVAL study. Linear regression was used for observational analyses between BMI and platelet characteristics. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate a causal effect with BMI proxied by a genetic risk score. Follow-up analysis explored the relevance of platelet characteristics on whole blood platelet aggregation in a pre-operative cardiac cohort (COPTIC) using linear regression. Observationally, higher BMI was positively associated with greater plateletcrit (PCT), platelet count (PLT), immature platelet count (IPC) and side fluorescence (SFL, a measure of mRNA content used to derive IPC). MR provided causal estimates for a positive effect of BMI on both SFL and IPC (IPC 0.06 SDs higher per SD higher BMI, 95% CI 0.006 to 0.12, P=0.03), but there was no strong evidence for a causal effect of BMI on PCT or PLT. The COPTIC study provided observational evidence for a positive association between IPC and whole blood platelet aggregation induced by adrenaline, TRAP-6 and ADP. Our results indicate that higher BMI raises the number of immature platelets, which is associated with greater whole blood platelet aggregation. Higher IPC could therefore contribute to obesity-related thrombosis.","Goudswaard, L. J.; Corbin, L. J.; Burley, K. L.; Mumford, A.; Akbari, P.; Soranzo, N.; Butterworth, A. S.; Watkins, N.

The authors ask how demographic variables, preexisting vulnerability, and proximity to health, economic, and care work impacts may shape attitudes about governmental policies aimed at risk reduction during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Grounding their analysis in literature on risk perception and attitudes about health policy, the authors report results from survey research on COVID-19 among more than 2,000 Washington State residents from summer 2020. Multivariate analyses show that proximity to the economic impacts of COVID-19 had little effect on policy support or trust, whereas proximity to health risk and care work impacts had moderate effect. Political orientation emerged as the strongest predictor of policy support, with conservatives showing less support than liberals for state health policies aimed at mitigating health risks associated with COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2021.","Janning, M.; Cordner, A.; Galant-LaPorte, Z.; Rosenberg, L.",Socius,https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231211033375,250

COVID-19 and the Re-bordering of the World,2021,"The interaction of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) correlates with increased virus transmissibility and disease severity in humans. Two strategies may be considered for preventive or treatment purposes: the blockage of the ACE2 receptors or the shielding of receptor-binding domains (RBD) in the Sprotein of COVID-19, as well as the S2 cleavage site that is used by the furin enzyme of the host cells in the late phase of virus activation. Herein, the interaction of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with the Sprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated using molecular docking and molecular dynamics. CQD molecules were optimized by the HF/3-21G level of theory;the probable interactions between the CQDs with Sprotein were studied by blind docking mode, considering the Sprotein as the receptor and CQDs as ligands. Ethanol, folic acid, Favipiravir, two kinds of functionalized triangular hexagonal graphene, and four kinds of functionalized CQDs were studied on a comparative basis. The results show that OH and amine-functionalized CQDs tend to interact with three branches of Sprotein, especially RBD. The fact that they can block the S2 cleavage site leads to their potential use as a therapeutic agent.","Ramezani, Zahra Dayer Mohammad Reza Noorizadeh Siamak Thompson Michael",COVID,https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1010011,250

Introspecting the 21st century from the given nexus, we are quite likely to conclude that it has remained a century when the human destructiveness has reached its creative pinnacle. 'Creative progression' disguised under the garb of SARS COVID-19 is currently ransacking mankind, resulting in mass genocide, destruction of cultures and worldviews. The creative human self now remains predisposed with the activation of low-grade mental illness. depression, anxiety and trauma. Tagore's 'creative self' with a magisterial rebuke had always protested the prevalent dominant theories of violence and counter- violence down the time line. His philosophical vision intertwined with the humane self of 'being' instead of 'becoming' counterpoises this 'creative enigma' of scientific and material human progression even to this day.

Design/methodology/approach - A thematic content analysis was conducted to analyse COVID tweets based on Gaspar et al.'s (2016) coping strategy framework. Findings - Six major COVID-19-related concerns communicated by New Zealand companies were found, with product/service being the most tweeted concern. Various coping expressions and strategies were demonstrated by the companies to address these concerns. Information sharing strategy was found to be the most common coping strategy implied in all six of these concerns. Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to the scant literature in crisis communication by providing empirical evidence on how COVID-19-related concerns, coping expressions and strategies were communicated by New Zealand companies. Originality/value - While extant coping research generally examined coping expressions and strategies in Western countries and at an individual level, this paper examines coping communication at organisational level in an Asia-Pacific country.

Emergency services are running at full capacity to keep citizens safe. Different agencies like hospitals, health centres, police departments, district administration etc. have to work hand to hand. The key to manage such an unprecedented and drastic situation with involvement of multiple agencies/authorities is effective use of technology. Understanding the spatial and time based dynamics of COVID-19 is useful for its mitigation, it helps to study the impact of the pandemic and can be used in decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health offcials, affected actors and first responders to evaluate the disease propagation and predict new outbreaks. This chapter is an effort to evolve an integrated GIS/GPS based e-Governance platform which effectively used by all those agencies involved in control of the disease. It is useful to monitor and manage tracking of human movement, coordinate to health department and sanitary services, prepare proper scientific and socioeconomic analysis and progressive flow related to COVID-19 situation/spread in real time basis. The platform is having different modules for different agencies including patients for effective and timely management of the crisis with minimum overheads and ensuring minimum suffering to all agencies. It contains modules for Patients/Citizens, Police Department, Health Department, Hospitals, Corporations/NGOs, ground workers etc. All agencies will have real time GIS based dashboards, MIS reports and notification systems to deal with the situation just in time.

By estimating a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, we provide systematic evidence on the relationship among inflation, uncertainty, and Bitcoin and gold prices. Bitcoin appreciates against inflation (or inflation expectation) shocks, confirming its inflation-hedging property claimed by investors. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin prices decline in response to financial uncertainty shocks, rejecting the safe-haven quality. Interestingly, Bitcoin prices do not decrease after policy uncertainty shocks, partly consistent with the notion of Bitcoin's independence from government authorities. We also find an interesting asymmetry in the drivers of Bitcoin price dynamics between the bullish and bearish market. The main findings hold with or without the COVID-19 pandemic episode.","Choi, Sangyup Shin Junhyeok",Finance Research Letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102379,250

The paper explains how trust theory and procedural rationality review help to address concerns related to legitimacy and expertise. The paper argues that courts should distinguish between two stages. In the initial stage, fear as a driver for government support based on expertise justifies that the proportionality test is limited to the question of whether measures were based on virologist expert advice. In the next stage, people expect the government to take expert-informed decisions, but also require that the government takes into account societal needs. Procedural rationality review in this stage demands that courts examine whether the decision was based on an informed balance of rights and interests. © The Author(s), 2021.

The present study sought to replicate and extend that work using a larger sample and a validated set of neuropsychological tests: The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Methods: Forty-four participants (21 younger adults, 23 older adults) completed a battery of cognitive and motor tasks that included the RBANS. EEG data was collected both during rest and on-task. Excluding the alpha-band, RBANS scores were regressed onto the slope of the resting EEG power spectrum, controlling for age and using robust mediation analysis. Results: Older adults performed reliably lower on the composite RBANS and the Coding, List Recall, List Recognition, and Figure Recall subtests. However, boot-strapped mediation models only showed a mediating effect of the spectral slope on the RBANS composite and the Coding subtest. Conclusions: The resting slope of the EEG power spectrum mediated age-related differences in cognition in the current study, which replicates prior work and is consistent with the neural noise hypothesis of aging. In extending this work, it was shown that these effects are strongest in tasks requiring speeded processing and/or executive functions, whereas this effect was weaker (to absent) for delayed memory, even though age-related differences were present. This pilot study warrants further exploration of the EEG power spectrum in age-related cognitive decline.","Pathania, A.; Clark, M.; Cowan, R.; Euler, M. J.; Duff, K.; Lohse, K.

Here, we show that altered patterns of temperature variance lead to an almost order-of-magnitude shift in thermal performance of host and pathogen life history traits over and above the effects of mean temperature and, moreover, that different temperature regimes affect these traits differently. We found that diurnal fluctuations of ±3°C lowered infection rates and reduced spore burden compared to constant temperatures in our focal host Daphnia magna exposed to the microsporidium parasite Ordospora colligata. In contrast, a three-day heatwave (+6°C) did not affect infection rates, but increased spore burden (relative to constant temperatures with the same mean) at 16°C, while reducing burden at higher temperatures. We conclude that changing patterns of climate variation, superimposed on shifts in mean temperatures due to global warming, may have profound and unanticipated effects on disease dynamics.","Kunze, Charlotte; Luijckx, Pepijn; Jackson, Andrew L.; Donohue, Ian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.31.458468,250

170258,Policy Impact on Regional Biogas Using a Modular Modeling Tool,2021,"Viruses originated from 'Primordial Nucleic Acids' with lipid and protein encapsulations. Chance fusion with cellular entities and intracellular replication of exogenotes started the journey of viruses on this planet. While replicating, pairing occurred in between the viral exogenotes and the host endogenote at their homologous sites. Therefore, both of the genes become recombined. Sometimes the viral exogenotes get integrated into the host genome resulting in a new reading frame in gene sequences. So, at every cycle of cellular infection with a viral particle, both the host and the parasite genes are recombined. The virulent the viral infection, the better is the chance of gene recombination of the host. Every stratum of cellular living forms has its viral pathogen. In lower living forms, depending on the habitats, a complete gene or its fragments may enter a cell using membrane receptors from the nucleic acid pool resulted from the lysis of cellular entities or viral particles, and gene recombination occurs. These are Transforming Principles or Transposable Elements. This lateral passage of genes through individuals is called Horizontal Gene Transfer. When mediated by viruses, it is called Transduction. Eventually, gene recombination occurs at the cellular level. Genetic Recombination is the basis of speciation, survival, evolution, and a way out of genetic bottleneck in cellular life. Humans too are facing a genetic bottleneck and living on the edge of extinction. Therefore, the viral infections in humans might be one of mother nature's designs to find a way out of this genetic bottleneck and survive and evolve further. © 2020 iGlobal Research and Publishing Foundation.

Neither instructors nor students had ample time to prepare. The purpose of the current study is to accomplish two objectives: to explore the functional relationship between attitudinal readiness (ATR), subjective well-being (SWB), and cloud-based e-learning adoption intention in Taiwan and examine the constancy of recommended proposed relationships among different students’ groups. The model was then empirically tested using data of 256 university students by structural equation modeling. The current study demonstrates that ATR is completely explained through four dimensions: peer reference, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived ubiquity. SWB is positively interpreted through four dimensions: online course quality, system quality, perceived service quality, and perceived closeness. Self-efficacy has a significant relationship with both attitudinal readiness and adoption intention of a cloud-based e-learning system. Finally, the invariance test explores substantial variance among students who intend to use the system and students who reject it.

Methods: The PROMPT trial is a prospective, non-interventional, multi-center randomized, controlled clinical trial that enrolled 397 adult patients presenting to the ED with signs of acute infection and at least one vital sign change. The infection status was adjudicated using chart review (including a syndromic molecular respiratory panel, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein) by three infectious disease physicians blinded to InSep results. InSep (version BVN-2) was performed using PAXgene Blood RNA processed and quantified on NanoString nCounter SPRINT. InSep results (likelihood of bacterial and viral infection) were compared to the adjudicated infection status. Results: Subject mean age was 64 years, comorbidities were significant for diabetes (17.1%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.6%), and severe neurological disease (6.8%); 16.9% of subjects were immunocompromised. Infections were adjudicated as bacterial (14.1%), viral (11.3%) and noninfected (0.25%): 74.1% of subjects were adjudicated as indeterminate. InSep distinguished bacterial vs. viral/noninfected patients and viral vs. bacterial/noninfected patients using consensus adjudication with AUROCs of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.99) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.96), respectively. AUROCs for bacterial vs. viral/noninfected patients were 0.88 (95%CI 0.79-0.96) for PCT, 0.80 (95% CI 0.72-89) for CRP and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69-0.87) for white blood cell counts (of note, the latter biomarkers were provided as part of clinical adjudication). To enable clinical actionability, InSep incorporates score cutoffs to allocate patients into interpretation bands. The Very Likely (rule in) InSep bacterial band showed a specificity of 98% compared to 94% for the corresponding PCT band (>0.5 ug/L); the Very Unlikely (rule-out) band showed a sensitivity of 95% for InSep compared to 86% for PCT. For the detection of viral infections, InSep demonstrated a specificity of 93% for the Very Likely band (rule in) and a sensitivity of 96% for the Very Unlikely band (rule out). Conclusion: InSep demonstrated high accuracy for predicting the presence of both bacterial and viral infections in ED patients with suspected acute infections or suspected sepsis. When translated into a rapid, point-of-care test, InSep will provide ED physicians with actionable results supporting early informed treatment decisions to improve patient outcomes while upholding antimicrobial stewardship.","Safarika, A.; Wacker, J.

170679,Influence of Determinants on Innovations in Small KIBS Firms in the Czech Republic before COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 is a novel viral disease with little known about its management. The Nairobi Hospital (TNH) has been involved in managing these patients. This study sought to describe the patients admitted in the hospital due to COVID-19, their management and outcomes. This was a retrospective review of COVID-19 patients admitted at TNH between March and October 2020. Demographic and clinical data, pharmacological management and outcomes of these patients was retrieved from the hospital electronic records, and analyzed. Results revealed that there were 326 study participants with a mean age (s.d.) of 47.1 (15.5) years, of whom 221(67.8%) were male. Those that were critically ill were 55(16.9%), while 186(57.1%) had mild/moderate disease. More than half of the participants had at least one co-morbidity, with hypertension and diabetes being predominant. Remdesivir was the commonest investigational drug and was administered to 39 patients. The patients were mainly managed with paracetamol (83.3%), ascorbic acid (79.8%), anticoagulants (64.4%), antihistamines and cough syrups (53.7%). Dexamethasone was the steroid of choice, having been used in 44% of the patients. Antibiotics were administered to 157 (48.4%) of the patients with Levofloxacin being the most prescribed. The mortality rate was 10% and was significantly associated with advanced age, having multiple comorbidities and severe illness. It was thus understood that management of COVID-19 inpatients at TNH was mainly supportive. There's need to emphasize on prevention measures especially among the elderly and those with multiple comorbidities.","Mariita, K. M.; Wanjala, A. N.; Maina, C.

170999,Effect of COVID-19 on acquisition of employable skills among national service personnel in Ghana,2021,"The early months of the COVID-19 pandemic brought about significant disruptions in food supply chains, which increased consumers' concern about possible food shortages and price gouging. To ensure personal food security, many consumers began stockpiling food and water in unusually large amounts. The goal of this study was to investigate individual- and household-level predictors of food and water stockpiling (FWS) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic among Non-Latino Black and Latino adults. This study was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data. Participants were 2,174 Non-Latino Black (66.4%) and Latino (33.6%) adults residing in a Midwestern state, who completed the survey in either May or June/July 2020. Participants were asked to self-report (yes or no) if they stockpiled food and/or water in the prior 7 days in response to the pandemic. A variety of variables was examined, including education level, annual income, employment status, concerns about COVID-19, and self-quarantine status. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were used to identify variables associated with FWS. Non-Latino Black participants had lower odds of reporting FWS compared to Latinos (OR 0.64;95% CI, 0.51-0.79). Similarly, participants who were not concerned about COVID-19 had lower odds of FWS compared with those extremely concerned (OR 0.37;95% CI, 0.20 – 0.71). In contrast, odds of FWS were higher among participants who were self-quarantining all the time compared to those who were not (OR 2.16;95% CI, 1.31 – 3.59). Results showed that Latinos, adults concerned about COVID-19, and self-quarantine status had significantly higher odds of FWS during the pandemic. None.

171326,Pandemic Proceedings: Legal Performance in the Time of Covid-19,2021,"Estimating the true extent of the outbreak was one of the major challenges in combating COVID-19 outbreak early on. Our inability in doing so, allowed unreported/undetected in- fections to drive up disease spread in numerous regions in the US and worldwide. Accurately identifying the true magnitude of infections still remains a major challenge, despite the use of surveillance-based methods such as serological studies, due to their costs and biases. In this paper, we propose an information theoretic approach to accurately estimate the unreported infections. Our approach, built on top of an existing ordinary differential equations based epi- demiological model, aims to deduce an optimal parameterization of the epidemiological model and the true extent of the outbreak which ""best describes"" the observed reported infections. Our experiments show that the parameterization learned by our framework leads to a better estimation of unreported infections as well as more accurate forecasts of the reported infec- tions compared to the baseline parameterization. We also demonstrate that our framework can be leveraged to simulate what-if scenarios with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results also support earlier findings that a large majority of COVID-19 infections were unreported and non-pharmaceutical interventions indeed helped in mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak.","Cui, J.; Haddadan, A.; Haque, A.

The aim of this study was to develop the Institutional Culture Assessment Scale (ICAS), and evaluate its Factor Structure, Reliability and Validity in a Brazilian sample of medical students and physicians in different settings and phases of the medical career. Method: 2537 individuals were evaluated by an online questionnaire. The sample was split in half for independent testing of Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. We then used Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to test the best solutions in the second half of the sample. Then, considering a unidimensional model solution, an item response theory (IRT) analysis was conducted. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate associations between ICAS factor scores and internal validators (burnout scores), using again the second half of the sample. Result: Parallel analysis revealed two factors. The first factor encompassed items involving the institution and supervisors. The second factor encompassed items involving peers. We decided to performed the next analysis with a unidimensional construct based solely on institution/supervisor items. A unidimensional model including the remaining seven items from the ICAS instrument revealed an excellent fit with the data. All items loaded significantly on the unidimensional latent trait with factor loadings ranging from 0.583 to 0.869. McDonalds Omega was 0.89, showing a high internal consistency. Conclusion: This study presents a valid and reliable scale to assess aspects of institutional culture connected to the relationships with superiors/supervisors and to the relation to the institutions themselves.","Carneiro Monteiro, G.

Health disparity adversely affects disadvantaged subpopulations due to a higher incidence and prevalence of a particular disease or ill health. Existing health disparity determines whether a disease outbreak such as coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), will significantly impact a group or a region. Hence, health disparity assessment has become one of the focuses of many agencies, public health practitioners, and other social scientists. Successful elimination of health disparity at all levels requires pragmatic approaches through an intersectionality framework and robust data science.","Iyanda, Ayodeji Boakye Kwadwo Lu Yongmei",Encyclopedia,https://doi.org/10.3390/encyclopedia1030057,250

We used different statistics (means, medians, trends, relative rates, linear relationships) to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the number of IS admissions and reperfusion therapies.ResultsAlthough the non-standardized number of IS admissions, IVTs and EVTs decreased only in some measure during the COVID-19 epidemic, the trend analysis demonstrated a significant disruption in the trends. The reduction’s dynamic and extent have differed for each variable, and the number of IS admissions decreased to a disproportionally larger extent than the number of IVTs and EVTs. In contrast to IVT, the number of IS admissions and EVTs showed a significant negative linear correlation with the number of new or cumulative COVID-19 cases in Hungary.ConclusionsCollateral damages of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Hungarian IS care system were demonstrated. The disproportionally greater decline of IS admission numbers could partially be explained by the effect of health emergency operative measures.

173146,A bibliometric analysis of COVID-19 research in Malaysia using latent dirichlet allocation,2021,"Background: Over 2 million deaths from the COVID-19 disease have been reported in the world. Since no antiviral treatment is available, the vaccination is the most important option to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients living with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affecting the immune system or under immunosuppressive agent will be considered as a high risk population and will start the vaccination shortly. But many patients could decline the vaccine for several reasons including safety concerns. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the proportion of patients with RA who are favourable to COVID-19 vaccination, to know the reasons to decline and to analyse the characteristics of these patients. Methods: We included patients with RA from the UCLouvain Brussels cohort who met the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria. A simple and standard questionnaire was distributed to patients who attended rheumatology out patient and day care clinic from 14 december 20 to 14 januari 21. All patient and RA characteristics (Age, gender, education, smoking habits, disease duration, ACPA, RF, DAS28-CRP, HAQ and therapies) were collected at the same time. Results: Data from 460 eligible RA patients were analyzed. The average age of the population is 58.21 years. 72% of the patients are women. 21% are smokers and 65% are positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) with a mean DAS28-CRP of 2.39 and a mean HAQ of 0.821. 281 patients (61%) indicated they would receive the vaccine as soon as it is available. For the 179 patients (39%) who decline, the reasons for not having vaccine were no trust in the vaccine at this time (53%), fear of side effects (28%), opposition to vaccine (4%), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (2%) and unknown (5%), Interestingly, there were differences among RA patients not willing to receive the vaccine. Patient under the age of 50, women, low education grade, smokers, presence of RF/ACPA and treatment with a bioDMARD were less willing to receive the vaccine. No differences were observed for RA disease duration, HAQ and DAS28-CRP (see Table 1). Conclusion: In our RA cohort, the rates of willingness to receive the vaccine are promising. Dedicated education and outreach efforts should be developed, especially in some RA subpopulation.","Sokolova, T.; Pirson, V.; Xavier, T.; Curraj, E.; Bricman, L.; Sapart, E.; De Montjoye, S.; Dierckx, S.; Avramovska, A.; Durez, P.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1779,250

Methods: A cross-sectional Internet monitoring survey was performed between December 22 and 26, 2020. Data from 9,510 (5,392 males and 4,118 females) participants needing regular treatment or hospital visits were analyzed. We determined the age, sex and multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of treatment interruption associated with various indices of infection level by nesting multilevel logistic models in prefecture of residence. In the multivariate model, sex, age, marital status, job type, equivalent household income, education, self-rated health, and anxiety were adjusted. Results: The ORs of treatment interruption for the lowest versus highest levels of infection were 1.32 (95% CI: 1.09 to 1.59) for the overall incidence rate (per 1,000 population), 1.34 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.63) for the overall number of people infected, 1.28 (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.54) for the monthly incidence rate (per 1,000 population), and 1.38 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.67) for the number of people infected per month. For each index of infection level, higher infection was linked to more workers experiencing treatment interruption. Conclusion: Higher local infection levels were linked to more workers experiencing treatment interruption. Our results suggest that apart from individual characteristics such as socioeconomic and health status, treatment interruptions during the pandemic were also subject to contextual effects related to regional infection levels. Preventing community spread of COVID-19 may thus protect individuals from indirect effects of the pandemic, such as treatment interruption.","Akashi, J.; HIno, A.; Tateishi, S.; Nagata, T.; Tsuji, M.; Ogami, A.; Matsuda, S.; Kataoka, M.; Fujino, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.21.21260691v1?rss=1,250

Through simulations and applications to GWAS and whole-genome sequencing data for multiple diseases and traits we show that the proposed test increases the power over state-of-the-art gene-based tests in the literature, identifies genes that replicate in larger studies, and can provide a more narrow focus on the possible causal genes at a locus by reducing the confounding effect of linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, our results show that incorporating genetic variation in distal regulatory elements tends to improve power over conventional tests. Results for UK Biobank and BioBank Japan traits are also available in a publicly accessible database that allows researchers to query gene-based results in an easy fashion.","Ma, S.; Dalgleish, J.; Lee, J.; Wang, C.; Liu, L.; Gill, R.; Buxbaum, J.; Chung, W.; Aschard, H.; Silverman, E.; Cho, M.; He, Z.; Ionita-Laza, I.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.14.21260405v1?rss=1,250

Using four subspecies of Drosophila mojavensis as a model, we identify two behaviorally active male-specific pheromones. One functions as a conserved male anti-aphrodisiac in all subspecies and acts via gustation. The second induces female receptivity via olfaction exclusively in the two subspecies that produce it. Genetic analysis of the cognate receptor for the olfactory pheromone indicates an important role for this sensory pathway in promoting sexual isolation of subspecies, in collaboration with auditory signals. Surprisingly, the peripheral sensory pathway detecting this pheromone is conserved molecularly, physiologically and anatomically across subspecies. These observations imply that subspecies-specific behaviors arise from differential interpretation of the same peripheral cue, reminiscent of sexually conserved detection but dimorphic interpretation of male pheromones in D. melanogaster. Our results reveal that, during incipient speciation, pheromone production, detection and interpretation do not necessarily evolve in a coordinate manner.","Khallaf, Mohammed A.; Auer, Thomas O.; Grabe, Veit; Depetris-Chauvin, Ana; Ammagarahalli, Byrappa; Zhang, Dan-Dan; Lavista-Llanos, Sofía; Kaftan, Filip; Weißflog, Jerrit; Matzkin, Luciano M.; Rollmann, Stephanie M.; Löfstedt, Christer; Svatoš, Aleš; Dweck, Hany K.M.; Sachse, Silke; Benton, Richard; Hansson, Bill S.; Knaden, Markus",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/854364,250

174661,After Covid-19: A survey on the prospects for cities,2021,"Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure presents therapeutic challenges due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch and shunt. The goal of management strategies is to improve arterial oxygenation, however each management strategy presents risk to patients from iatrogenic injury. Intravenous oxygen therapeutics present an appealing option to improve arterial oxygenation without these risks. We used a two-hit murine model of acute lung injury to evaluate the effect of intravenous dodecafluoropentane (NanO2) on oxygen saturation and bronchoalveolar lavage cell count and protein. Mice were given intratracheal lipopolysaccharide and 20 hours later were intubated and ventilated with high tidal volumes. NanO2 was given by bolus injection at the initiation of mechanical ventilation and again at 2 hours, while oxygen saturation was measured every 15 minutes. At the conclusion of the experiment (4 hours), a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. There was no difference in mean O2 saturation at time zero, however the difference between the mean O2 saturation immediately prior to injection and the mean first O2 saturation after injection in the control saline group were 91% and 83%, mean difference −7.5%; whereas mean O2 saturation in the NanO2 treated group rose from 89% to 91%, mean difference +2.5%, net difference 10% [95% CI: 2.7,17.3], p=0.01). There was a statistically significant difference in cell count, but not protein, on the bronchoalveolar lavage analysis. These data show that NanO2 rapidly improves oxygen saturation in a two-hit model of acute lung injury, and shows potential as an intravenous oxygen therapeutic in the management in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Mosier, Jarrod M; Sammani, Saad; Kempf, Carrie; Unger, Evan; Garcia, Joe GN",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.17.253658,250

Here, we tested the safety and efficacy of CMA in NAFLD patients in a placebo-controlled 10-week study. We found that CMA significantly decreased hepatic steatosis and levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, and creatinine, whereas found no differences on these variables in the placebo group after adjustment for weight loss. By integrating clinical data with plasma metabolomics and inflammatory proteomics as well as oral and gut metagenomics data, we revealed the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the reduced hepatic fat and inflammation in NAFLD patients and identified the key players involved in the host-microbiome interactions. In conclusion, we observed that CMA can be used develop a pharmacological treatment strategy in NAFLD patients.","Zeybel, M.; Altay, O.; Arif, M.; Li, X.; Yang, H.; Fredolini, C.; Akyildiz, M.; Saglam, B.; Gonenli, M.

If the FMs are to play a vibrant role in the Viennese alternative food system, enhancing urban–rural connections and urban resilience, they must re–align their values to this system. A values-based conceptual framework is used to examine the structures and functions of six Viennese FMs and the alignment of values and practices among FM managers, farmers/vendors and consumers. Data from qualitative interviews, participant observation and dot surveys were collected at each FM. Value alignment is discovered as necessary to support and perpetuate alternative values. Governance is found to be significant for aligning values related to FM sustainability. Current structures and functions of Viennese FMs cannot be easily aligned with participant values and practices. As one of the first examinations of Viennese FMs, this work illustrates concrete challenges, priorities and emphasizes the role that governance and social organizing plays in successful markets as contributors towards sustainable urban food systems. Lessons learned can be applied to municipal FMs and other food system actors that face similar challenges.","Klimek, Milena Bingen Jim Freyer Bernhard Paxton Rebecca",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158327,250

This study examines how COVID-19 has brought about changes in, and shifting patterns of, emergency incidents in the City of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. This study aims to derive insights that could potentially inform planning and decision-making of fire and rescue service operations as further stages of the pandemic unfold. Design/methodology/approach: Standard temporal analysis methods are applied to investigate the changes in the number and nature of emergency incidents, as recorded sequentially in the city's fire and rescue service incident report database, through various phases or waves of the pandemic and the associated public health measures that have been introduced. Findings: The study analyses show a decrease in the number of emergency calls compared to previous reference years. Vehicle-related incidents show the highest decline, and changes in daily and hourly pattens are consistent with public health measures in place during each stage of the pandemic. The study concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on demand for emergency services provided by the fire department. Originality/value: The authors believe this is the first study applying temporal analysis on a city's emergency incident response data spanning various phases/waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

175634,Virtual programming during COVID: What we wished we had known in advance,2021,"Background Symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be reduced by nonpharmacological nasal sprays that create a barrier between allergens and the nasal mucosa. A new nasal spray (AM-301) containing the clay mineral bentonite was tested for its ability to reduce symptoms to grass pollen. Methods This open label, crossover, noninferiority trial compared the efficacy and safety of AM-301 to that of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; Nasaleze Allergy Blocker), an established barrier method. Adults with seasonal allergic rhinitis were exposed to Dactylis glomerata pollen, in the Fraunhofer Allergen Challenge Chamber, first without protection and then protected by HPMC or AM-301 (7 days apart). Efficacy was assessed from total nasal symptom score (TNSS), nasal secretion weight, and subjective rating. The primary endpoint was the difference, between AM-301 and HPMC, in least square mean change in TNSS over a 4-hour exposure to allergen. Results The study enrolled 36 persons, and 35 completed all study visits. The mean TNSS was 5.91 during unprotected exposure, 5.20 during protection with HPMC, and 4.82 during protection with AM-301. The difference in least square means between the two treatments was -0.39 (95% CI, -0.89 to 0.10), establishing the noninferiority of AM-301. No difference in mean weight of nasal secretions was observed between the treatments. Efficacy was rated as good or very good for AM-301 by 31% and for HPMC by 14% of subjects. 16 subjects reported adverse events with a relationship to AM-301 or HPMC; most adverse events were mild and none was serious. Conclusions AM-301 demonstrated noninferiority towards HPMC in the primary endpoint and was perceived better in subjective secondary endpoints.

This article aims to contribute to this field of study through the specific lens of the city of Lisbon’s experience as an internationally acknowledged leader in participatory budgeting. To this end, the article critically examines the lessons and potential contribution of the Lisbon Participatory Budget through a multimethod approach. Emerging trends and variations of citizen proposals, projects, votes, and public funding are analysed in tandem with emerging key topics that show links and trade-offs between locally embedded participation and the international discourse on urban sustainability. Our analysis reveals three interconnected findings: first, the achievements of the Lisbon Participatory Budget show the potential to counteract the dominant engineered approach to urban sustainability;second, trends and variations of the achievements depend on both citizens’ voice and the significant influence of the city council through policymaking;and, third, the shift towards a thematic Green Participatory Budget in 2020 was not driven by consolidated social and political awareness on the achievements, suggesting that more could be achieved through the 2021 urban sustainability oriented Participatory Budget. We conclude recommending that this kind of analysis should be systematically carried out and disseminated within city council departments, promoting much needed internal awareness of PBs’ potential as drivers of urban sustainability.

175721,"Characteristics, effective reproduction number (Rt), and prediction sir model of covid-19 at banyumas district, central java, indonesia",2021,"INTRODUCTION The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has created a sudden lack of ventilators. DuplicAR® is a novel device that allows simultaneous and independent ventilation of two subjects with a single ventilator. The aims of this study are: a) to determine the efficacy of DuplicAR® to independently regulate the peak and positive-end expiratory pressures in each subject, both under pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation, and b) to determine the ventilation mode in which DuplicAR® presents the best performance and safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two test lungs are connected to a single ventilator using DuplicAR®. Three experimental stages are established: 1) two identical subjects, 2) two subjects with the same weight but different lung compliance, and 3) two subjects with different weight and lung compliance. In each stage, the test lungs are ventilated in two ventilation modes. The positive-end expiratory pressure requirements are increased successively in one of the subjects. The goal is to achieve a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg for each subject in all different stages through manipulation of the ventilator and the DuplicAR® controllers. RESULTS DuplicAR® allows adequate ventilation of two subjects with different weight and/or lung compliance and/or PEEP requirements. This is achieved by adjusting the total tidal volume for both subjects (in volume-controlled ventilation) or the highest peak pressure needed (in pressure-controlled ventilation) along with the basal positive-end expiratory pressure on the ventilator, and simultaneously manipulating the DuplicAR® controllers to decrease the tidal volume or the peak pressure in the subject that needs less and/or to increase the positive-end expiratory pressure in the subject that needs more. While ventilatory goals can be achieved in any of the ventilation modes, DuplicAR® performs better in pressure-controlled ventilation, as changes experienced in the variables of one subject do not modify the other one. CONCLUSIONS DuplicAR® is an effective tool to manage the peak inspiratory pressure and the positive-end expiratory pressure independently in two subjects connected to a single ventilator. The driving pressure can be adjusted to meet the requirements of subjects with different weight and lung compliance. Pressure-controlled ventilation has advantages over volume-controlled ventilation and is therefore the recommended ventilation mode.","Lugones, Ignacio; Ramos, Matías; Biancolini, Fernanda; Giambastiani, Roberto Orofino",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.425652,250

Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. MethodsSpecimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. ResultsAbbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at >30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohens kappa varied between 0.86-0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM <14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG [â¥]14 days. ConclusionThe Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV <14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.","Higgins, Victoria; Fabros, Anselmo; Wang, Xiao Yan; Bhandari, Maria; Daghfal, David J; Kulasingam, Vathany",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.23.20217810,250

This paper contributes to the literature on Igor Grossman's concept of wise reasoning and its applicability to COVID-19 management decision-making by political leaders. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employed an exploratory qualitative design. The decision to adopt qualitative method is linked to the paucity of research on wise reasoning, political leadership and COVID-19. The paper draws on qualitative online survey with 42 nurses located in Accra Metropolis, Ghana. Findings: The paper demonstrates that a confluence of research participants perceived the government's act of easing the lockdown restrictions to be in bad faith on account of (1) nonrecognition of different perspectives and viewpoints from stakeholders and interest groups;(2) rising number of cases which naturally make the decision to lift the restriction unwise;(3) concerns about the prioritization of peripheral issues over citizens' health and (4) concerns about limited and robust health facilities and their implications. Research limitations/implications: The key claims must be assessed against the limitations of the study. First, the study is an exploratory study and, therefore, not intended for a generalization purpose. Second, the research participants are highly educated, and the responses in this study are skewed toward them. Originality/value: The paper is novel in seeking to explore wise reasoning and political leadership during a global pandemic such as COVID-19. This exploratory study demonstrates that COVID-19, though devastating and causing havoc, presents an opportunity to test Igor Grossmann's wise reasoning framework about decision-making by political leaders.

Specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to detect either ToBRFV or the closely related Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). This technology enabled the differential detection of ToBRFV and ToMV. Sensitivity assays revealed that viruses can be detected from 15-30 ng of RT-PCR product, and that specific detection could be achieved from a mix of ToMV and ToBRFV. In addition, we show that this method enabled the identification of ToBRFV in samples collected from commercial greenhouses.

Trump’s social media, along with excerpts from his speeches and press releases, this study sheds light on the framing of white supremacy during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Our findings reveal that the triad of divide, divert, and conquer was crucial to Trump’s communications strategy. We argue that racist nativism—or racialized national threats to American security—is key to comprehending the external divisiveness in this strategy. When Trump bitterly cast China as the cause of America’s pandemic fallout and Mexico as the source of other key American problems (i.e., crime and low-paid jobs for U.S.-born Americans), he sowed clear racialized divisions between the United States (U.S.). and these two nations. We further argue that nativist racism—or the framing of descendants from those nations as incapable of ever being American—is key to comprehending the internal divisiveness in the former President’s pandemic rhetoric. Trump’s framing of China and Mexico as enemies of America further found its culprits in Asian and Latino Americans who were portrayed as COVID-19 carriers. Trump’s narrative was ultimately geared to diverting attention from his administration’s mishandling of COVID-19, the dismal structural conditions faced by detained and undocumented Latinos, and the anti-Asian bias faced by some of his Asian American constituents. In the conclusions, this article makes a call for countering white supremacy by developing comparative approaches that pay more attention to how different racisms play out for different groups.","Louie, Vivian Viladrich Anahí",Social Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10080280,250

In contrast to a long tradition of scholarship that has consistently suggested that government debt has a detrimental impact on economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, recent studies have actually shown that government debt, when coupled with improvements in the quality of government, is actually a driver of economic growth. By analyzing an original dataset that covers the 2002?15 period and additional debt?economic growth data going up to the year 2020, we are able to suggest three conclusions. First, in the absence of debt, good governance matters in improving economic growth. Second, some dimensions of governance are better predictors of economic performance than others?as the ?good enough governance? literature has in recent years suggested. Third, under no circumstances is debt government growth beneficial for the economic performance of African countries. Building on this evidence, we suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic?which has already slowed down African economies and increased their debt exposure?may prevent African countries from making greater progress along the developmental path.","Kinyondo, Abel Pelizzo Riccardo Byaro Mwoya",World Affairs,https://doi.org/10.1177/00438200211025519,250

Surface technologies that control pathogen transfer can help control fomite transmission and are of great interest to public health. Here, we report a novel bead transfer method for evaluating fomite transmission in common laboratory settings. We show that this method meets several important criteria for quantitative test methods, including reasonableness, relevancy, resemblance, responsiveness, and repeatability, and therefore may be adaptable for standardization. In addition, this method can be applied to a wide variety of pathogens including bacteria, phage, and human viruses. Using the bead transfer method, we demonstrate that an engineered micropattern limits transfer of Staphylococcus aureus by 97.8% and T4 bacteriophage by 93.0% on silicone surfaces. Furthermore, the micropattern significantly reduces transfer of influenza B virus and human coronavirus on silicone and polypropylene surfaces. Our results highlight the potential of using surface texture as a valuable new strategy in combating infectious diseases. Disease transmission often occurs through contact with contaminated surfaces, called fomites. Efforts to reduce this method of fomite transmission include surface cleaning, personal hygiene, alteration of habits, and novel technologies to reduce pathogen spread. This manuscript presents a novel method for the consistent contamination of surfaces to mimic the transmission of pathogens via fomites. Using this method, we present a surface texture modeled on shark skin that significantly reduces the transfer of a variety of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, influenza B virus, and human coronavirus 229E.

There exist some obstacles, especially during the pre-implementation phase of TR, necessitating an investigation of existing local evidence. This research aimed to investigate the challenges of TR. Methods: Five electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, SID, & Magiran) were searched for studies published in English and Persian language from 2011 to February 2021. Search results in all databases provided a total of 598 articles. After reviewing the titles of the articles, we excluded 574 articles as they were duplicated and/or irrelevant. Finally, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 11 articles have remained. Results: Most extracted articles were published in 2020 (n=4). The remaining articles disturbed between 2013 until 2021. These articles were mostly reviews, case reports/series, or qualitative studies and surveys. Geographically, 27% of the final selected papers belonged to the USA, 46% to Asia, and 27% to Europe. Outcomes in studies mostly included TR advantages and disadvantages, facilitators, challenges, and barriers. Discussion: Studies specified numerous challenges for TR implementation. The main challenges in the technologies used in TR were the awareness and culture of individuals and the TR infrastructure. Despite these barriers, TR could be a better treatment selection in some patients. Therefore, it is necessary for health policymakers, and especially rehabilitation managers, technology developers, scientists, and clinicians to cooperatively make serious efforts to remove these barriers. © 2021","Rabanifar, N.; Abdi, K.",Iranian Rehabilitation Journal,https://doi.org/10.32598/irj.19.2.1404.1,250

Objectives: To assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in AIIRD patients and to define clinical factors affecting this prevalence. Methods: Consecutive consenting AIIRD patients from the Rheumatologic department in Tel Aviv Medical Center participated in the study. Patients answered a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A two stage antibody testing was done in order to increase specificity. Results: The study included 560 AIIRD patients (229 RA, 149 PsA, 84 SLE, 55 vasculitidies, 40 SpA, 3 other CTD), of them 26 patients were found to have SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (4.6%) (Table 1). This was more than double than aprevious prevalence in the same clinic population studied after the first wave of the pandemic in Israel, which was 2.07% (accepted for publication). A lower rate of immunosuppression was found for positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG patients compared to negative serology patients (Table 1, p=0.009). There was also a trend for the subgroup of patients on biologic DMARDS (26.92% vs. 47% respectively, p=0.06). Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was reported and confirmed in 36 patients, of them 14 (38.89%) had negative serology. Patients who did not have antibodies had numerically more than double rates of glucocorticoids and bDMARDs treatment. The time between positive PCR test to positive serology test was significantly shorter (mean±standart deviation 75.57±40.44 days) than the time between positive PCR to negative serology test (130.79±86.47 (p=0.04) (Table 1 and Figure 1) suggesting a fading of the antibody response with time. Conclusion: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 4.6% in a population of AIIRD patients from a single tertiary medical center in Israel. SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence tended to be low among AIIRD patients on immunosuppressive treatment, including in patients with a confirmed history of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR, similar to other studies [3]. As in individuals without AIIRD, the mounting of SARS-CoV-2 IgG seems to fade with time. Larger studies are needed to confirm the potential effect of immunosuppression on the antibody response in AIIRDs.","Eviatar, T.; Levartovsky, D.; Furer, V.; Polachek, A.; Elalouf, O.; Zisapel, M.; Halperin, T.; Turner, D.; Paran, D.; Pel, S.; Nevo, S.; Elkayam, O.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2107,250

178838,Sharing experiential information in online discussion: the case of coping with the COVID-19 epidemic,2021,"Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons are essential for reproduction, but their role in the control of energy balance and other homeostatic functions remains unclear. High frequency firing of hypothalamic arcuate Kiss1 (Kiss1ARH) neurons releases kisspeptin into the median eminence, and neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin onto neighboring Kiss1ARH neurons to generate a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) mediated by TRPC5 channels that entrains intermittent, synchronous firing of Kiss1ARH neurons. High frequency optogenetic stimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons releases glutamate to excite the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and inhibit the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons via metabotropic glutamate receptors. At the molecular level, the endoplasmic reticulum calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is critically involved in the regulation of neuronal Ca2+ signaling and neuronal excitability through its interaction with plasma membrane calcium (e.g., TRPC) channels. 17β-estradiol (E2) downregulates Stim1 mRNA expression in female arcuate neurons. Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of Stim1 in Kiss1ARH neurons would increase neuronal excitability and their synchronous firing, which ultimately would affect energy homeostasis. Using optogenetics in combination with whole-cell recording and GCaMP6 imaging in slices, we discovered that the deletion of Stim1 in Kiss1 neurons significantly increased the amplitude of the slow EPSP and augmented synchronous [Ca2+]i oscillations in Kiss1ARH neurons. Deletion of Stim1 in Kiss1ARH neurons amplified the actions of NKB and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting. Therefore, STIM1 appears to play a critical role in regulating synchronous firing of Kiss1ARH neurons, which ultimately affects energy homeostasis. Significance Statement Hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin (Kiss1ARH) neurons are essential for stimulating the pulsatile release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and maintaining fertility. However, Kiss1ARH neurons appear to be a key player in coordinating energy balance with reproduction. The regulation of calcium channels and hence calcium signaling is critically dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum calcium-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), which interacts with the plasma membrane calcium channels. We have conditionally deleted Stim1 in Kiss1ARH neurons and found that it significantly increased the excitability of Kiss1ARH neurons and protected ovariectomized female mice from developing obesity and glucose intolerance with high-fat dieting.","Qiu, Jian; Stincic, Todd L.; Bosch, Martha A.; Connors, Ashley M.; Petrie, Stefanie Kaech; Rønnekleiv, Oline K.; Kelly, Martin J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.289017,250

The existing models based on convolutional neural networks contain a giant number of parameters, and thus require multi-advanced GPUs to deploy. In this paper, we are the first to develop the adaptive morphological neural networks to classify chest X-ray images, such as pneumonia and COVID-19. A novel structure, which can self-learn morphological dilation and erosion, is proposed to determine the most suitable depth of the adaptive layer. Experimental results on the chest X-ray and the COVID-19 datasets show that the proposed model can achieve the highest classification rate as compared against the existing models. Moreover, it can significantly reduce the computational parameters of the existing models by 97%.

During this crisis multi-professional teams across the NHS developed and implemented new models of service at pace.AimsIn times of crisis there can be tendency to first panic and then forget. As doctors and clinical leaders in training, utilising this as a learning experience is vital. We propose a phased learning model to reflect on this unprecedented period with the aim of strengthening our leadership skills.MethodThe proposed ‘leadership time capsule’ is a continuous reflective process rather than a single stand-alone exercise enabling the user to learn from the pandemic as we move forward but also look back on the crisis and reflect in the moment. This learning tool is aimed for trainees and consists of five phases;Reflection, Consolidation, Growth, Embedding, and Evaluation. Integral to the time capsule are signposts to resources and toolkits.As leadership fellows, we have piloted the capsule reflecting on four different trainee perspectives:Impact on trainingRedeploymentTelemedicineRemote workingDiscussionThis tool provides a template for reflective practise on our experience, realising and sharing the lessons that have been learnt. As a group of fellows, this tool was used as a ‘shared experience’ process exploring leadership in our various environments, learning from our experiences and realising how we can develop as leaders going forward. This reflective time capsule highlights the importance of learning from significant challenges faced during the pandemic.ConclusionActive participation in the leadership time capsule facilitates the process of building on experiential learning during a crisis. Critical lessons from this process can inform trainee leadership development to ensure competences and confidence when facing future challenges.","Shelton, Fenella Boylan Johnny Jenkins Paul Conley Harriet Thurlow Jane",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.139,250

However, to date, the literature on Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has provided no guidelines for remote moderated user tests that collect facial expression data and synchronize them with the state of a dynamic stimulus such as a webpage. To address this research gap, this article offers guidelines for effective AFEA data collection that are based on a methodology developed in a concrete research context and on the lessons learned from applying it in four remote moderated user testing projects. Since researchers have less control over test environment settings, we maintain that they should pay greater attention to factors that can affect face detection and\or emotion classification prior, during, and after remote moderated user tests.

The lockdown implemented for counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic has determined an unprecedented situation of social deprivation, forcing individuals to dramatically reduce face-to-face interactions. This, in turn, has caused relevant consequences on psychological well-being. However, the impact of lockdown-related social isolation on basic cognitive processes is still largely unknown. Here, we focus on social attention and address gaze cueing, namely the ability to shift attention in response to the gaze of others. This is a hard-wired cognitive mechanism critically supporting the establishment of social interactions and pervasive relationships among individuals. Our results show a stronger gaze-cueing effect during, rather than after, the lockdown, whose magnitude was positively correlated with social isolation distress. These findings indicate that, in a condition of prolonged social deprivation, orienting of attention may be shaped by hypersensitivity to social cues, likely due to the strive to re-connect with others.","Dalmaso, Mario; Castelli, Luigi; Galfano, Giovanni",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004221012529; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221012529?v=s5,250

Methods: Observational study carried out at Brians-1 Prison, Barcelona. After detecting a case of infection, rt-PCR was administered to all prisoners (some of whom had been vaccinated 21-23 days previously with a dose of AVChOx1) and to staff. Infection rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations were calculated, as was vaccine effectiveness. Results: One hundred and eighty-four asymptomatic prisoners (50.3% vaccinated) and 33 staff were screened. Forty-eight (25.9%) infections by the SCV-B.1.17 variant were recorded in prisoners and none in staff. Infection rates were higher in younger prisoners, immigrants, and those admitted [≥]7 days previously. In all, 22.6% of vaccinated subjects were infected vs. 29.3% of unvaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness was 23%. Only 6.2 cases would have been prevented by vaccinating the unvaccinated individuals. At seven days, the rt-PCR was negative in 46.2% of vaccinated subjects vs. 13.6% of unvaccinated (p = 0.02). Discussion: In a prison outbreak, a dose of AVChAdOx1 administered 21-23 days earlier did not significantly prevent the occurrence of infections, but did reduce the duration of rt-PCR positivity. Maintaining post-vaccination preventive measures is essential.","Marco, A.; Teixido, N.; Guerrero, R.

Green energy to provide economic growth after COVID-19,2020,"Background: Periodontal care, which was completely suspended during the peak of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic and was delayed and recurrently discontinued during the succeeding waves, must be safely provided in the COVID-19 era. Objectives: The study aimed to provide recommendations on periodontal practice, optimizing safety, ergonomics, and economic resources, and the management of periodontal patients, ensuring continuity, timing, and effectiveness of periodontal care in the COVID-19 era. Methods: Reported protocols for the dental practice in the context of the COVID-19 and current evidence on periodontitis treatment and prevention were reviewed. Results: Evidence-based recommendations on contamination control and ergonomic improvements for periodontal practice and the management of periodontal patients challenging COVID-19 and airborne infectious diseases have been provided. Conclusion: Due to the economic, ergonomic, and ethical concerns raised by limited periodontal care due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, and awareness of other emerging airborne transmitted infections, the periodontal practice should integrate measures minimizing airborne cross-infections and optimizing time-space and economic resources. The management of periodontal patients in the COVID-19 era should comprise less complex treatments and more comprehensive and definitive approaches, reducing emergencies, session length and number, and, concurrently, extending the recall and maintenance intervals. Moreover, it should implement prevention strategies through teledentistry tools and apps, improving periodontal awareness and self-care, and also through the self-reporting of periodontitis and periodontal risk assessment tools, performing both ""population-based"" and ""high-risk"" surveillance of periodontitis. Finally, it should enhance inter-professional collaboration, through telehealth networks, especially targeting subjects at high-risk of both periodontitis and systemic disorders, each of the two variously linked to COVID-19 onset and worsening.","Di Spirito, F.; Iacono, V.

181999,The Future is Unwritten: Listening to the Rhythms of COVID-19,2020,"TikTok is a music-based video sharing social media app famous for users creating short meme and dance videos. TikTok videos are largely based on popular song snippets, which is why lip syncing and dance moves evolve as significant user performance practices in videos. User prosumption has not yet been studied regarding the characteristics of TikTok. This paper is based on social practice and performance theory, social media studies, and participatory online video culture. It uses the #distantdance challenge on TikTok to analyze production practices and strategies of users through qualitative video product analysis. 92 videos were coded and categorized regarding their visual content (who participated in which way) and paratextual elements (used tags and captions). The visual and (para-)textual elements were then analyzed regarding indicators that allow to draw conclusions on users' video creation strategies and performance practices in participating in the #distantdance challenge. The results show videos are mainly performed by single white female teenagers wearing casual outfits in their bedrooms. Users shared their experiences about learning and performing the dance in video captions. While users prepared settings and outfits for their performance, the majority of performances seems rather unplanned or spontaneous. This indicates most videos might be part of a series of user attempts to master the dance challenge resulting in posting the first successful video performance to TikTok. In addition to the dance moves, participants also added gestures as closing elements to their performances. This indicates their knowledge of using signals as part of an online community while at the same time manifesting their belongingness to the community. These first results of a qualitative product analysis illustrate some of users' motivations and effort to participate in TikTok dance challenges.","Klug, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13040v1.pdf,250
182119,Rethinking “economic fundamentals” in an era of global physical shocks: Insights from the philippines experience with covid-19,2021,"Overall Abstract: SUDs are among the top contributors to all cause mortality. This session highlights cross-cutting genetic and genomic analyses that illuminate the relationships between substance use disorders (SUDs) and aspects of health and disease beyond the known relationships with other psychiatric disorders. This is a topic that has gotten very little attention in the past. It is timely, given multiple global health crises, as it addresses the role of SUDs in respiratory and cardiometabolic illness, COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS – each among the leading contributors to mortality. The first talk will showcase findings from a phenome-wide analysis (PheWAS) of alcohol and cannabis involvement, using medical center data. It demonstrates that genetic liability for substance use has a profound effect on multiple bodily systems. For example, genetic liability for cannabis use predicted respiratory illness while that for alcohol use predicted heart disease. Individuals with SUDs are at higher risk to develop severe cases of COVID-19. The second talk examines genetic correlations between COVID-19 severity phenotypes and 1014 heritable traits, and reveals that the largest genetic causality proportions were for alcohol use frequency, smoking and cannabis use. Third, we pivot from the current pandemic to the ongoing HIV epidemic to discuss the impact of cocaine abuse among HIV+ individuals. The findings showed cocaine use increased viral load, worsened progression, accelerated mortality, and increase the latent viral reservoir. Specific DNA methylation and gene expression differences that appear to be biological mediators of these relationships were uncovered. The last talk addresses the mediating role of behavioral disinhibition, which is genetically correlated with SUD, using a multivariate GWAS approach to creating a broad genetic measure of externalizing behavior (EXT). Pooling data from ∼1.5 million people, more than 500 genetic loci were discovered. A PheWAS showed that EXT-PRS was associated with 255 of the 1335 disease phenotypes tested (FDR < 0.05). Individuals with higher EXT-PRS showed poorer health in nearly every bodily system. To conclude, the panel will discuss the importance of considering the genetics of SUDs more broadly, to better understand both psychiatric and somatic disorders and the enormous health burden arising from them.

182261,Unpacking the IFRS Implications of COVID-19 for Travel and Leisure Companies Listed on the JSE,2021,"Successful mathematical modeling of biological processes relies on the expertise of the modeler to capture the essential mechanisms in the process at hand and on the ability to extract useful information from empirical data. The very structure of the model limits the ability to infer numerical values for the parameters, a concept referred to as structural identifiability. Most of the available methods to test the structural identifiability of a model are either too complex mathematically for the general practitioner to be applied, or require involved calculations or numerical computation for complex non-linear models. In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters. The method is based on rigorous mathematical results but it is easy and quick to apply, even to test the identifiability of sophisticated highly non-linear models. We illustrate our method by example and compare its performance with other existing methods in the literature. Author summary Theoretical Biology is a useful approach to explain, generate hypotheses, or discriminate among competing theories. A well-formulated model has to be complex enough to capture the relevant mechanisms of the problem, and simple enough to be fitted to data. Structural identifiability tests aim to recognize, in advance, if the structure of the model allows parameter fitting even with unlimited high-quality data. Available methods require advanced mathematical skills, or are too costly for high-dimensional non-linear models. We propose an analytical method based on scale invariance of the equations. It provides definite answers to the structural identifiability problem while being simple enough to be performed in a few lines of calculations without any computational aid. It favorably compares with other existing methods.","Castro, Mario; de Boer, Rob J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.933630,250

Autologous progenitors do not meet the clinical need for regeneration due to their insufficient expansion and differentiation, for which human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising alternatives. Airway epithelial grafts are engineered by differentiating hiPSC-derived airway progenitors into physiological proportions of ciliated (73.9±5.5%) and goblet (2.1±1.4%) cells on a Silk Fibroin-Collagen Vitrigel Membrane (SF-CVM) composite biomaterial for transplantation in porcine tracheal defects ex vivo and in vivo. Evaluation of ex vivo tracheal repair using hiPSC-derived SF-CVM grafts demonstrate native-like tracheal epithelial metabolism and maintenance of mucociliary epithelium to day 3. In vivo studies reveal SF-CVM integration, maintenance of airway patency, showing 80.8±3.6% graft coverage with an hiPSC-derived pseudostratified epithelium and 70.7±2.3% coverage with viable cells, 3 days post-operatively. We demonstrate the utility of bioengineered, hiPSC-derived epithelial grafts for airway repair in a pre-clinical survival model, providing a significant leap for airway reconstruction approaches.","Varma, Ratna; Marin-Araujo, Alba E.; Rostami, Sara; Waddell, Thomas K.; Karoubi, Golnaz; Haykal, Siba",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.444629,250

One of the key promoters of this shift is servitization, which involves a shift from a purely transactional product-selling model to customer satisfaction through providing the service inherent to the product. Although servitization is a promising field for academics and practitioners, its adoption faces different challenges and drivers that need to be understood and addressed. A latent issue is the lack of common language around the topic. In the present study, a systematic literature review has been conducted to allow the identification and classification of the main challenges and drivers. Based on the findings, we propose a classification framework that identifies, classifies, and groups common challenges and drivers to different areas of knowledge on servitization through intensity heat maps.

184112,Detecting robust patterns in the spread of epidemics: a case study of influenza in the United States and France.,2007,"The discovery of mirror neurons in the macaque brain in the 1990s triggered investigations on putative human mirror neurons and their potential functionality. The leading proposed function has been action understanding: accordingly, we understand the actions of others by ‘simulating’ them in our own motor system through a direct matching of the visual information to our own motor programs. Furthermore, it has been proposed that this simulation involves the prediction of the sensory consequences of the observed action, similar to the prediction of the sensory consequences of our executed actions. Here, we tested this proposal by quantifying somatosensory attenuation behaviorally during action observation. Somatosensory attenuation manifests during voluntary action and refers to the perception of self-generated touches as less intense than identical externally generated touches because the self-generated touches are predicted from the motor command. Therefore, we reasoned that if an observer simulates the observed action and, thus, he/she predicts its somatosensory consequences, then he/she should attenuate tactile stimuli simultaneously delivered to his/her corresponding body part. In three separate experiments, we found a systematic attenuation of touches during executed self-touch actions, but we found no evidence for attenuation when such actions were observed. Failure to observe somatosensory attenuation during observation of self-touch is not compatible with the hypothesis that the putative human mirror neuron system automatically simulates the observed action. In contrast, our findings emphasize a sharp distinction between the motor representations of self and others.","Kilteni, Konstantina; Engeler, Patrick; Boberg, Ida; Maurex, Linnea; Ehrsson, H.

Thoracic Spine: • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation. • Three relevant diagnostic accuracy studies, with controlled comparative local anesthetic blocks, with concordant pain relief, with a criterion standard of ≥80% were included. • The prevalence varied from 34% to 48%, whereas false-positive rates varied from 42% to 58%.Therapeutic Facet Joint Interventions: Lumbar Spine: • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation for lumbar radiofrequency ablation with inclusion of 11 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 2 negative studies and 4 studies with long-term improvement. • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation for therapeutic lumbar facet joint nerve blocks with inclusion of 3 relevant randomized controlled trials, with long-term improvement. • The level of evidence is IV with weak strength of recommendation for lumbar facet joint intraarticular injections with inclusion of 9 relevant randomized controlled trials, with majority of them showing lack of effectiveness without the use of local anesthetic. Cervical Spine: • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation for cervical radiofrequency ablation with inclusion of one randomized controlled trial with positive results and 2 observational studies with long-term improvement. • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation for therapeutic cervical facet joint nerve blocks with inclusion of one relevant randomized controlled trial and 3 observational studies, with long-term improvement. • The level of evidence is V with weak strength of recommendation for cervical intraarticular facet joint injections with inclusion of 3 relevant randomized controlled trials, with 2 observational studies, the majority showing lack of effectiveness, whereas one study with 6-month follow-up, showed lack of long-term improvement. Thoracic Spine: • The level of evidence is III with weak to moderate strength of recommendation with emerging evidence for thoracic radiofrequency ablation with inclusion of one relevant randomized controlled trial and 3 observational studies. • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation for thoracic therapeutic facet joint nerve blocks with inclusion of 2 randomized controlled trials and one observational study with long-term improvement. • The level of evidence is III with weak to moderate strength of recommendation for thoracic intraarticular facet joint injections with inclusion of one randomized controlled trial with 6 month follow-up, with emerging evidence. Antithrombotic Therapy: • Facet joint interventions are considered as moderate to low risk procedures; consequently, antithrombotic therapy may be continued based on overall general status. Sedation: • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation to avoid opioid analgesics during the diagnosis with interventional techniques. • The level of evidence is II with moderate strength of recommendation that moderate sedation may be utilized for patient comfort and to control anxiety for therapeutic facet joint interventions. LIMITATIONS The limitations of these guidelines include a paucity of high-quality studies in the majority of aspects of diagnosis and therapy. CONCLUSIONS These facet joint intervention guidelines were prepared with a comprehensive review of the literature with methodologic quality assessment with determination of level of evidence and strength of recommendations.

192857,Nursing students' knowledge and practice of infection control precautions: an educational intervention.,2009,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The infectious disease challenges of war include pathogens endemic to the geographic area of operations as well as wound infections with common environmental microorganisms. This review summarizes papers, unpublished data and personal communications from 2004-2005 pertaining to infectious diseases during war with a focus on the current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. RECENT FINDINGS To date, there have been several hundred cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and five cases of visceral leishmaniasis among US military personnel serving in southwest Asia. There have been reports of malaria in soldiers serving in Afghanistan and an outbreak of acute eosinophilic pneumonia among soldiers serving in or near Iraq. Diarrheal illness is a well-known threat to military operations and remains problematic for combatants throughout the theater of operations. Infectious complications caused by multiply drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii have been particularly challenging for healthcare providers managing the wounded evacuated from Iraq. We are now facing outbreaks of nosocomial infection with this pathogen in military treatment facilities in Europe and the USA. SUMMARY Historically, infectious diseases have had significant impact on the conduct of military operations, and the conflict in southwest Asia is no exception. Physicians caring for returning military personnel should be aware of the diseases prevalent in this campaign, particularly cutaneous leishmaniasis and infections with multiply drug-resistant A. baumannii.","Zapor, Michael J; Moran, Kimberly A",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16148525/,250

The mainstay of management of patients with Ebola disease is isolation of patients and use of strict barrier nursing procedures; the present treatment strategies are mainly symptomatic and supportive (fluid resuscitation, antypyretics, antidiarrheal drugs). Currently, there is no approved therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), however several advanced treatment options were tested in animal models (on non-human primates or rodents). They include use of both symptomatic (e.g. use of tissue factor inhibitors - rhNAPc2, rhAPC - to abolish coagulopathy) and specific antiviral approaches: e.g. monoclonal anti EBOV antibodies (ZMapp, MB-003), phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), liposomes containing siRNA (LNP-siRNA:TKM-Ebola) and small molecule inhibitors (e.g. BCX4430, favipiravir). The scope of this article is to briefly review the most promising therapeutics for EHF, based on the data coming from rare clinical reports, studies on animals and results from in vitro models.","Olszanecki, Rafał; Gawlik, Grzegorz",Folia medica Cracoviensia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694097/,250

A positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in conjunction with clinical and epidemiologic data, is the current standard for diagnosis, but several challenges still exist. Serological assays help to understand epidemiology better and to evaluate vaccine responses but they are unreliable for diagnosis in the acute phase of illness or assuming protective immunity. Serology is gaining attention, mainly because of convalescent plasma gaining importance as treatment for clinically worsening COVID-19 patients. We provide a narrative review of peer-reviewed research studies on RT-PCR, serology and antigen immune-assays for COVID-19, briefly describe their lab methods and discuss their limitations for clinical practice.","Shyu, Daniel; Dorroh, James; Holtmeyer, Caleb; Ritter, Detlef; Upendran, Anandhi; Kannan, Raghuraman; Dandachi, Dima; Rojas-Moreno, Christian; Whitt, Stevan P; Regunath, Hariharan",Missouri medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32636542/,250
194302,Clinical negligence.,2005,"The effect on nasal epithelial cells in monolayer cultures of infection with rhinovirus, coronavirus 229E, influenza type A, and adenovirus was studied. Fragments (1 x 2 mm) of epithelium with adherent submucosa from nasal polyps, adenoids, or nasal turbinates were cultured in plastic dishes with media containing a serum supplement. Within a week a monolayer of epithelial cells with interspersed ciliated cells surrounded each fragment. Epithelial monolayers were exposed to 10(3) to 10(4) TCID50/ml of each virus; unattached virus was removed after 3 h. Replication of virus was examined by doing viral titrations of the media daily, and ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells in the monolayer were examined morphologically with an inverted microscope. The peak titer of rhinovirus and coronavirus occurred 24 to 48 h after inoculation, indicating that viral replication was occurring. However, no detectable damage or cytopathic effect (CPE) developed in the monolayer of epithelial cells when compared with that in uninfected control cells. In contrast, infection of epithelial monolayers with influenza or adenovirus resulted in CPE and destruction of the monolayer. The marked difference in the effect of these respiratory viruses on nasal epithelial cells may reflect similar differences in their effect on respiratory tract mucosa in the intact host. If so, the pathogenesis of symptom production during rhinovirus and coronavirus infections must be by mechanisms other than destruction of the nasal lining.","Winther, B; Gwaltney, J M; Hendley, J O",The American review of respiratory disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2158258/,250

In this study, we have investigated and compared the antiviral effect of different interferons (IFNs) on SARS-CoV replication in the epithelial kidney monkey Vero cell line. The results showed that SARS-CoV grown in Vero cells is moderately sensitive to IFN-beta and only weakly sensitive to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, in comparison to other IFN-sensitive viruses, such as those for encephalomyocarditis, vesicular stomatitis and Newcastle disease. Simultaneous incubation of Vero cells with IFN-beta and IFN-gamma indicated that they may act synergistically against SARS-CoV replication. The IFN-induced MxA protein was detected in the IFN-treated Vero cells. The data, however, suggest that the antiviral activity of IFN against SARS-CoV virus is independent of MxA expression.","Scagnolari, Carolina; Vicenzi, Elisa; Bellomi, Francesca; Stillitano, Maria Giuseppina; Pinna, Debora; Poli, Guido; Clementi, Massimo; Dianzani, Ferdinando; Antonelli, Guido",Antiviral therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15651759/,250

At 3 months after hospital discharge, 46 survivors of SARS underwent the following evaluation: spirometry, static lung volumes and carbon monoxide transfer factor (TL,CO). In total, 44 of these patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. No abnormalities were detected in the pulmonary function tests in 23 (50%) of the patients. Abnormalities of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC and TL,CO were detected in seven (15%), 12 (26%), one (2%) and 18 (39%) patients, respectively. All of these abnormalities were mild except in one case. In 18 patients (41%), the maximum aerobic capacity was below the lower limit of the normal range. Breathing reserve was low in four patients and significant oxygen desaturation was detected in a further four patients. Comparison of the measured exercise capacity with resting pulmonary function tests showed many cases of discordance in impairment. In conclusion, pulmonary function defects were detected in half of the recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome patients 3 months after hospital discharge, but the impairment was mild in almost all cases. Many patients had reduced exercise capacity that cannot be accounted for by impairment of pulmonary function.","Ong, K-C; Ng, A W-K; Lee, L S-U; Kaw, G; Kwek, S-K; Leow, M K-S; Earnest, A",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15358703/,250

However, there is no universal method and the technique depends on the local institutional resources and expertise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a simple new technique for the bedside placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube in an intensive care unit using palpation to confirm tube position. We studied 47 consecutive ventilated patients (mean body mass index 22.4 ± 4.2 kg/m(2)) requiring enteral tube feeding for nutritional support. We monitored the maximum intensity point of injected air 'bubbling' by palpation and estimated tube position. We monitored the movement of the maximum intensity point from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant. If the maximum intensity point on the right upper quadrant diminished or weakened, we considered the tube had proceeded beyond the pylorus. By palpation, we could feel the bubbling of the injected air in all patients, but four patients were excluded because of failure to complete the protocol. The overall success rate including the four excluded cases was 85.1% (40/47) on the first attempt and 91.5% (43/47) when we included the second attempt. The median time for 40 successful tube placements on the first attempt was 10 (7 to 23) minutes. Our new palpation technique can successfully detect the position of a feeding tube in the stomach and help guide the tube to the correct location in the post-pyloric portion of the stomach in lean critically ill patients.","Sekino, Motohiro; Yoshitomi, Osamu; Nakamura, Toshiaki; Makita, Tetsuji; Sumikawa, Koji",Anaesthesia and intensive care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22313077/,250

199206,COVID-19 infection risk management during construction activities: An approach based on Fault Tree Analysis (FTA),2020,"Accurate and rapid identification of pathogenic microorganisms is of critical importance in disease treatment and public health. Conventional work flows are time-consuming, and procedures are multifaceted. MS can be an alternative but is limited by low efficiency for amino acid sequencing as well as low reproducibility for spectrum fingerprinting. We systematically analyzed the feasibility of applying MS for rapid and accurate bacterial identification. Directly applying bacterial colonies without further protein extraction to MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed rich peak contents and high reproducibility. The MS spectra derived from 57 isolates comprising six human pathogenic bacterial species were analyzed using both unsupervised hierarchical clustering and supervised model construction via the Genetic Algorithm. Hierarchical clustering analysis categorized the spectra into six groups precisely corresponding to the six bacterial species. Precise classification was also maintained in an independently prepared set of bacteria even when the numbers of m/z values were reduced to six. In parallel, classification models were constructed via Genetic Algorithm analysis. A model containing 18 m/z values accurately classified independently prepared bacteria and identified those species originally not used for model construction. Moreover bacteria fewer than 10(4) cells and different species in bacterial mixtures were identified using the classification model approach. In conclusion, the application of MALDI-TOF MS in combination with a suitable model construction provides a highly accurate method for bacterial classification and identification. The approach can identify bacteria with low abundance even in mixed flora, suggesting that a rapid and accurate bacterial identification using MS techniques even before culture can be attained in the near future.","Hsieh, Sen-Yung; Tseng, Chiao-Li; Lee, Yun-Shien; Kuo, An-Jing; Sun, Chien-Feng; Lin, Yen-Hsiu; Chen, Jen-Kun",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18045801/,250
199528,A Fresh (Air) Look at Ventilation for COVID-19: Estimating the global energy savings potential of coupling natural ventilation with novel radiant cooling strategies,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) possesses a large 29.7-kb positive-stranded RNA genome. The first open reading frame encodes replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are cleaved to generate 16 ""nonstructural"" proteins, nsp1 to nsp16, involved in viral replication and/or RNA processing. Among these, nsp10 plays a critical role in minus-strand RNA synthesis in a related coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus. Here, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp10 at a resolution of 1.8 A as determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion using phases derived from hexatantalum dodecabromide. nsp10 is a single domain protein consisting of a pair of antiparallel N-terminal helices stacked against an irregular beta-sheet, a coil-rich C terminus, and two Zn fingers. nsp10 represents a novel fold and is the first structural representative of this family of Zn finger proteins found so far exclusively in coronaviruses. The first Zn finger coordinates a Zn2+ ion in a unique conformation. The second Zn finger, with four cysteines, is a distant member of the ""gag-knuckle fold group"" of Zn2+-binding domains and appears to maintain the structural integrity of the C-terminal tail. A distinct clustering of basic residues on the protein surface suggests a nucleic acid-binding function. Gel shift assays indicate that in isolation, nsp10 binds single- and double-stranded RNA and DNA with high-micromolar affinity and without obvious sequence specificity. It is possible that nsp10 functions within a larger RNA-binding protein complex. However, its exact role within the replicase complex is still not clear.","Joseph, Jeremiah S; Saikatendu, Kumar Singh; Subramanian, Vanitha; Neuman, Benjamin W; Brooun, Alexei; Griffith, Mark; Moy, Kin; Yadav, Maneesh K; Velasquez, Jeffrey; Buchmeier, Michael J; Stevens, Raymond C; Kuhn, Peter",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16873246/,250

To effectively use primates as models, their gross and histologic anatomy, physiology and natural history, as well as common health problems and the source from which the primate is obtained, must be known and understood by pathologists involved in study design and/or interpretation. The first very important lesson in the ""primer"" is: there is no such thing as a generic monkey. Brand names (ie, species and subspecies) are important. Several taxonomic groups of primates are used in research including: prosimians, such as galagos and lemurs; New World monkeys, particularily marmosets; Old World monkeys, especially macaques and baboons; and the chimpanzee, an African ape. Differences between taxa are exemplified by the glucocorticoid resistance of New World monkeys compared to Old World monkeys, which results in the requirement for Vitamin D3 and their high circulating levels of steroids such as cortisone and progesterone. Differences in ovarian histology between Old and New World monkeys probably relate to steroid receptor biology as well. There are also variations in disease manifestations, even among closely related primate species such as rhesus and cynomolgus macaques (cynos). For example type D retrovirus infection is accompanied by lymphomas in cynos, but not rhesus. The second important lesson in this ""primer"" is: ""not test article related"" does not always mean ""normal."" Lymphoid nodules in bone marrow or salivary gland, a common background finding in macaques, often signal the presence of type D retrovirus. Other histologic changes and normal anatomic variations may be confusing to individuals not routinely examining primate tissues. The objective of this paper is to familiarize pathologists with the use of primates in research as well as lesions and nonlesions (normal anatomy or physiology) of primates that may influence study design and confound interpretation.","Lowenstine, Linda J",Toxicologic pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12597436/,250

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two orthopaedic medical staff from the orthopaedic center of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were included in this retrospective investigation. A total of 43 surgeons and 69 nurses provided medical support in the treatment of COVID-19 patients from 1 January 2020 to 8 April 2020 in four different hospitals in Wuhan. We collected data on the age, gender, and body temperature of orthopaedic medical staff, as well as the results for their chest CT scans, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG tests, and training and examinations on COVID-19 knowledge. We also collected data on the time span of work, the number of infected staff during the support period, the number of COVID-19 patients the surgeons treated and the cure rate, the performance of the surgeons as assessed by the specialists and patients, and the number of infected staff during the pandemic.

During the whole pandemic, 3 surgeons and 3 nurses who did not participate in the support work were infected in the early stages. The morbidity of all the orthopaedic staff was 4.92% during the whole pandemic, while no one was infected during the support work. CONCLUSION: Our investigation indicated that although they worked outside their specialty, it was safe and effective for the orthopaedic staff to provide medical support in the work against COVID-19 with adequate precautions and proper training.","Wen, Yin-Xian; Wang, Hua; Tie, Kai; Ni, Qu-Bo; Qin, Jun; Tan, Yang; Pan, Zheng-Qi; Chen, Biao; He, Hang-Yuan; Chen, Liao-Bin",Orthop Surg,,250

The purpose of the study is to understand current practices related to accepting these LKDs.â¯. Methods: We surveyed US transplant programs from September 3 through November 3, 2020. Center level and participant level responses were analyzed. Results: A total of 174 respondents from 115 unique centers responded, representing 59% of US LKD Programs and 72.4% of 2019 and 72.5% of 2020 LKD volume1(Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network-OPTN 2021). 48.6% of responding centers had received inquiries from such LKDs, while 44.3% were currently evaluating. 98 donors were in evaluation phase, while 27.8% centers had approved 42 such donors to proceed with donation. 50.8% of participants preferred to wait > 3 months while 91% would wait at least > 1 month from onset of infection to LD surgery. Most common reason to exclude LDs was evidence of COVID-19 related AKI (59.8%) even if resolved, followed by COVID-19 related Pneumonia (28.7%) and Hospitalization (21.3%). Most common concern in accepting such donors was kidney health post donation (59.2%), followed by risk of transmission to recipient (55.7%),donor perioperative pulmonary risk (41.4%) and donor pulmonary risk in the future (29.9%). Conclusions: Practice patterns for acceptance of COVID-19 recovered LKD showed considerable variability.

The significance of Ct values in epidemiological studies and large cohorts is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To monitor Ct values in a long-term study and compare the results with demographic data of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. STUDY DESIGN: S gene SARS-CoV-2 Ct values were analyzed retrospectively from consecutive patients between March 15th to September 15th 2020 with special regard to age, gender, and in- or outpatient status. RESULTS: In total, 65,878 patients were tested, 1103 (1.7 %) of whom were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six positive patients were excluded, because the respective PCR runs did not meet the stability requirements (Ct value of the positive controls between 26 and 29). Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04). Patients in the age groups >80 years had significantly higher Ct values than the remaining age groups (p < 0.001). Children (0-19 years) showed Ct values in the range of those found in adults (25.2 vs. 25.1, p = 0.9). There were no statistically different Ct values between in- and outpatients (p = 0.1), however, SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients were significantly older than outpatients (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CT values are suitable for more detailed monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Age is an important cofactor in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and may have influence on Ct values in SARS-CoV-2-PCR.","Ade, Carolin; Pum, Joachim; Abele, Iris; Raggub, Lubna; Bockmühl, Dirk; Zöllner, Bernhard",J Clin Virol,,250

Methods: an online survey was shared with orthopaedic surgeons practicing in different countries. Results: this study showed that orthopaedic surgery plan management was adapted to respond more effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining the continuity of health care and ensuring protection of medical staff and patients. Among the introduced measures, elective surgery was postponed to free-up beds for suspected or COVID-19 positive patients requiring hospitalization. Additionally, the number of outpatient visits was considerably decreased and non-urgent visits were postponed to reduce the flow of patients in and out of hospitals and therefore minimize the risk of contamination. Interestingly, data revealed the willingness of orthopaedic surgeons to take care of COVID-19 positive patients and support their colleagues in intensive care units, if needed. Conclusion: orthopaedic surgery departments have adapted their programs to face the unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quick measures were taken to reduce the risk of contamination in patients, medical staff and to allow hospitals to free up beds for treatment of patients with positive or suspected COVID-19.","Meraghni, Nadhir; Bouyoucef, Hichem; Larbi, Redouane Si; Soal, Nacim; Benkaidali, Riad; Derradji, Mohamed; Kara, Zoubir; Hamza, Amine",Pan Afr Med J,,250

We provide a roadmap from the access to epidemiological data sources to the control of epidemic phenomena. We review the available methodologies and discuss the challenges in the development of data-driven strategies to combat the spreading of infectious diseases. Our aim is to bring together several different disciplines required to provide a holistic approach to epidemic analysis, such as data science, epidemiology, and systems-and-control theory. A 3M-analysis is presented, whose three pillars are: Monitoring, Modelling and Managing. The focus is on the potential of data-driven schemes to address three different challenges raised by a pandemic: (i) monitoring the epidemic evolution and assessing the effectiveness of the adopted countermeasures; (ii) modelling and forecasting the spread of the epidemic; (iii) making timely decisions to manage, mitigate and suppress the contagion. For each step of this roadmap, we review consolidated theoretical approaches (including data-driven methodologies that have been shown to be successful in other contexts) and discuss their application to past or present epidemics, such as Covid-19, as well as their potential application to future epidemics.","Alamo, Teodoro; G Reina, Daniel; Millán Gata, Pablo; Preciado, Victor M; Giordano, Giulia",Annual reviews in control,,250

In this study, the effects of oral uptake of melamine, melamine formaldehyde, and polyvinyl chloride on serum biochemical profiles, antioxidant enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation levels and brain acetyl cholinesterase activities in Clarias gariepinus juveniles were investigated. METHODS: Fish specimens were fed diets spiked with melamine, melamine formaldehyde and poly vinyl chloride at 0.3% (3.0 g Kg-1) dietary inclusion for 45 days. Toxicity effect of these plastic chemicals was estimated by assaying relevant biomarkers. RESULTS: After 45 days exposure, Serum glucose was significantly elevated, whereas plasma protein levels were substantially reduced in the exposed fish groups. Serum transaminases were significantly elevated in the exposed groups. Brain acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzyme activities declined significantly, while malondialdehyde levels were elevated in the exposed groups. CONCLUSION: C. gariepinus is an important bioindicator to monitor the ecotoxicological impact of plastic chemicals such as melamine, and polyvinyl chloride.","Iheanacho, Stanley Chidi; Igberi, Christiana; Amadi-Eke, Akunna; Chinonyerem, Delight; Iheanacho, Angus; Avwemoya, Fred",Biomarkers,,250
205063,Economic thoughts on COVID-19 for Canadian food processors,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed an acute, sharp rise in the use of video consultations (VCs) by general practitioners (GPs) in Norway. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document GPs' experiences with the large-scale uptake of VCs in the natural experiment context of the pandemic. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Norwegian GPs during the pandemic lockdown (April 14-May 3, 2020). Each respondent was asked to evaluate up to 10 VCs. Basic demographic characteristics of the GPs and their practices were collected. The associations between GPs' perceived suitability of the VCs, the nature of the patients' main problems, prior knowledge of the patients (relational continuity), and follow-up of previously presented problems (episodic continuity) were explored using descriptive statistics, diagrams, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 1237 GPs (26% of the target group) responded to the survey. Among these, 1000 GPs offered VCs, and 855 GPs evaluated a total of 3484 VCs. Most GPs who offered VCs (1000/1237; 81%) had no experience with VCs before the pandemic. Overall, 51% (1766/3476) of the evaluated VCs were considered to have similar or even better suitability to assess the main reason for contact, compared to face-to-face consultations. In the presence of relational continuity, VCs were considered equal to or better than face-to-face consultations in 57% (1011/1785) of cases, as opposed to 32% (87/274) when the patient was unknown. The suitability rate for follow-up consultations (episodic continuity) was 61% (1165/1919), compared to 35% (544/1556) for new patient problems. Suitability varied considerably across clinical contact reasons. VCs were found most suitable for anxiety and life stress, depression, and administrative purposes, as well as for longstanding or complex problems that normally require multiple follow-up consultations. The GPs estimate that they will conduct about 20% of their consultations by video in a future, nonpandemic setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of VCs performed in general practice during the pandemic lockdown indicates a clear future role for VCs in nonpandemic settings. The strong and consistent association between continuity of care and GPs' perceptions of the suitability of VCs is a new and important finding with considerable relevance for future primary health care planning.","Johnsen, Tor Magne; Norberg, Børge Lønnebakke; Kristiansen, Eli; Zanaboni, Paolo; Austad, Bjarne; Krogh, Frode Helgetun; Getz, Linn",J Med Internet Res,,250

We combine several conventional and innovative data sources with a detailed strategic transport model at the EU level, in order to present quantitative estimates under various scenarios. New remote work patterns or personal risk avoidance attitudes can lead to increased levels of car ownership and use. Public policy priorities in the aftermath of the pandemic would need to address the emerging challenges and adopt measures that can sustain the shift to active travel, support public transport, railways and aviation and stimulate innovation in transport technologies and services.","Christidis, P.; Christodoulou, A.; Navajas-Cawood, E.; Ciuffo, B.",Sustainability,,250

Design of efficient NPIs requires identification of the structure of the disease transmission network. We here identify the key parameters of the COVID-19 transmission network for time periods before, during, and after the application of strict NPIs for the first wave of COVID-19 infections in Germany combining Bayesian parameter inference with an agent-based epidemiological model. We assume a Watts-Strogatz small-world network which allows to distinguish contacts within clustered cliques and unclustered, random contacts in the population, which have been shown to be crucial in sustaining the epidemic. In contrast to other works, which use coarse-grained network structures from anonymized data, like cell phone data, we consider the contacts of individual agents explicitly. We show that NPIs drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network, increased network clustering, and resulted in a change from an exponential to a constant regime of newcases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave with a finite wave speed that depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear fashion, which we can predict by mean field theory. Our analysis indicates that besides the well-known transitionbetween exponential increase and exponential decrease in the number of new cases, NPIs can induce a transition to another, previously unappreciated regime of constant new cases.","Syga, Simon; David-Rus, Diana; Schalte, Yannik; Meyer-Hermann, Michael; Hatzikirou, Haralampos; Deutsch, Andreas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03846v2.pdf,250

With the pandemic spreading at such an alarming rate, a lot of efforts are in the process of identification of an effective treatment at it's earliest. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is such a drug that is being studied as a repurposed agent, although the early results are still inconclusive. However, an important adverse effect that has raised concerns in the recent times is its possible cardiac toxicity, mainly the 'QT,' prolongation in electro-cardiogram, which has created a sense of apprehension for its use in traditional indications like rheumatological conditions. In decades of HCQ use by rheumatologists, this cardiac toxicity was rarely ever seen. So, what is different in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era? This review outlines various studies on HCQ reporting cardiac adverse events in patients with rheumatic diseases as well as, in patients with COVID-19 infection. In addition, two important observations were noticed; first, the doses that have been used in the current COVID-19 scenario are much higher than what are used in rheumatology. Second, COVID-19 infection may by itself lead to intrinsic cardiac abnormalities, which is probably acting as a confounder. Most of the available and credible data suggest that HCQ is a safe drug, including the RECOVERY trial stating no cardiotoxicity by HCQ. This review reinforces the safety profile of HCQ in a data-driven manner and addresses the concerns of the physicians. However, its cautious use in those with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities cannot be overemphasized.","Padiyar, Shivraj; Danda, Debashish",,,250

A total of 835 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction were included (median age 64 years; 52% female). Of these, 46 (5.5%) had a prescription for an immunosuppressive therapy prior to diagnosis, most commonly oral steroids (20, 43%), mycophenolate (12, 26%), or tacrolimus (11, 24%). Patients on immunosuppressive therapy with COVID-19 had increased mortality (30% versus 17%, p=0.036; OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.11-4.04), which remained significant (p=0.040) after performing multivariate logistic regression controlling for gender, age, race, and comorbidity status. Laboratory markers of inflammation were uniformly elevated in both patients on or not on immunosuppressive therapies who died, but lymphocytes and neutrophils were decreased in both COVID-19 patients on immunosuppressive therapies who died and who remained alive. These findings demonstrate that COVID-19 disease is more severe in patients taking prior immunosuppressive medications. This finding emphasizes the need for aggressive monitoring and supportive care for immunosuppressed patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 69 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (with Ct value â&#8804; â28) were tested. Samples included in this study were selected from 7 areas of eastern Poland. All samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using a 300-cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2. BWA was used for reads mapping on the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence. SAMTools were used for post-processing of reads to genome assembly. Pango lineage and Nexstrain were used to identify variants and amino acid mutations. Statistical analysis was performed with R 4.0.2. RESULTS: This study shows the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland with the lineage B.1.351 (known as 501Y.V2 South African variant), as well as another 18 cases with epidemiologically relevant lineage B.1.1.7, known as British variant. Supplementary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in GISAID shows that the share of a new variant can change rapidly within one month. In addition, we show a complete, integrated concept of a networked system for analyzing the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which, used in the present study, generated data and a variant report within 6 days. CONCLUSION: The analyzed viral genomes showed considerable variability with simultaneous clear distinction of local clusters of genomes showing high similarity.

It is therefore important to quickly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread of this virus. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop county-level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data. METHODS: We estimated county-level COVID-19 occurrences for the period March 14 to 31, 2020, based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. We developed a three-stage model using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, to quantify the probability of COVID-19 occurrence and estimate the number of potential occurrences for unaffected counties. Finally, these results were combined to predict the county-level risk. This risk was then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county. RESULTS: The model predictions showed a sensitivity over 71% and specificity over 94% for models built using data from March 14 to 31, 2020. We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged >70 years, and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We observed a positive association at the county level between urbanicity and vulnerability to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies. Limited testing facilities and delayed results introduce significant variation in reported cases, which produces a bias in the model.","Mehta, Mihir; Julaiti, Juxihong; Griffin, Paul; Kumara, Soundar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,250

Despite one year of intensive research, the current treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infected people are still limited. Clearly, novel antiviral compounds for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are still urgently needed. Complementary medicine is used along with standard medical treatment and accessible to a vast majority of people worldwide. Natural products with antiviral activity may contribute to improve the overall condition of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin, the primary active ingredient of the licorice root, against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrated that glycyrrhizin potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Furthermore, we uncovered the underlying mechanism and showed that glycyrrhizin blocks the viral replication by inhibiting the viral main protease Mpro that is essential for viral replication. Our data indicate that the consumption of glycyrrhizin-containing products such as licorice root tea of black licorice may be of great benefit for SARS-CoV-2 infected people. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin is a good candidate for further investigation for clinical use to treat COVID-19 patients.","van de Sand, Lukas; Bormann, Maren; Alt, Mira; Schipper, Leonie; Heilingloh, Christiane Silke; Steinmann, Eike; Todt, Daniel; Dittmer, Ulf; Elsner, Carina; Witzke, Oliver; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Viruses,,250

MIS-C presents with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). We aimed to better understand this cytokine storm syndrome by comparing the initial laboratory findings of MIS-C and MAS. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with MAS due to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in our clinic between March 2002 and November 2020 and with MIS-C between 20 September and 20 October 2020 were enrolled into the study. The medical files of all patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 13 MAS (9 boys, 4 girls) and 26 MIS-C (16 boys,10 girls) patients were included in the study. Hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, fibrinogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels showed significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.05). Patients with MAS had lower hemoglobin (10.10 g/dL) and fibrinogen (2.72 g/dL), but higher ferritin (17 863 mg/dL) and LDH (890.61 U/L) at the time of diagnosis. Patients with MIS-C had higher absolute neutrophil count (12 180/mm3 ) and CRP (194.23 mg/dL) values, but lower absolute lymphocyte count (1140/mm3 ) at the time of diagnosis. Left ventricle ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MIS-C group in echocardiographic evaluation (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Ferritin, hemoglobin, LDH, and fibrinogen levels were significantly changed in MAS compared with MIS-C.

(preprint),2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first appeared in December 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Although much of the focus is on respiratory symptoms, recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause pregnancy complications such as pre-term birth and miscarriages; and women with COVID-19 had maternal vascular malperfusion and decidual arteriopathy in their placentas. Here, we report that ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. The ACE2 mRNA and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. Further, HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA impaired the full decidualization response, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1. Additionally, in mice during pregnancy, ACE2 protein was expressed in uterine epithelial, and stromal cells increased through day six of pregnancy. Finally, progesterone induced Ace2 mRNA expression in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen. These data establish a role for ACE2 in endometrial physiology, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to enter endometrial stromal cells and elicit pathological manifestations in women with COVID-19 including an increased risk of early pregnancy loss.","Chadchan, Sangappa B; Popli, Pooja; Maurya, Vineet K; Kommagani, Ramakrishna",Biol. reprod,,250

However, the risk factors for such bacterial coinfection are hitherto unknown. A case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors for bacterial infection in moderate to critical COVID-19. Out of a total of 50 cases and 50 controls, the proportion of cases with severe/critical disease at presentation was 80% in cases compared to 30% in controls (p < 0.001). The predominant site was hospital-acquired pneumonia (72%) and the majority were Gram-negative organisms (82%). The overall mortality was 30%, with comparatively higher mortality among cases (42% vs. 18%; p = 0.009). There was no difference between procalcitonin levels in both groups (p = 0.883). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, significant independent association was found with severe/critical COVID-19 at presentation (AOR: 4.42 times; 95% CI: 1.63-11.9) and use of steroids (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI: 1.24-17.05). Notably, 64% of controls were administered antibiotics despite the absence of bacterial coinfection or secondary infection. Risk factors for bacterial infections in moderate to critically ill patients with COVID-19 include critical illness at presentation and use of steroids. There is widespread empiric antibiotic utilization in those without bacterial infection.","Nasir, Nosheen; Rehman, Fazal; Omair, Syed Furrukh",J Med Virol,,250
214103,The psychology of COVID-19: Building resilience for future pandemics,2021,"Research has shown that three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic virtual anatomic models can help students understand the complex spatial relationships of human structures that are not easily accessible via dissection. For instance, the cerebral cortex is located within the cranial vault;however, it can be difficult to view the relationship between the cerebral cortex and skull via dissection. This project goes into discussing the creation of a 3D stereoscopic model of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex model was segmented via Amira 5.6 software from computed tomography angiography (CTA) data. Amira 5.6 surface rendering methods were used to create the cerebral cortex, and volume rendering methods were used to create the skull. The segmentations were performed using the axial view and paintbrush tools in Amira 5.6 along with the Wacom pen and tablet. After completing the initial segmentation across 155 slides, the CTA scans were compiled in Amira 5.6 to create the 3D model of the cerebral cortex. A smoothing filter was then applied to the initial surface render of the cerebral cortex to smooth the transition from slide to slide. The cerebral cortex model generated can be viewed from any angle at any magnification level. In addition, the model can also be overlayed orthoslice CTA data to allow the user to have a stronger understanding of the relationship between each individual two-dimensional CTA image and the three-dimensional model. Moreover, the cerebral cortex virtual model can be created into video clips using the Amira 5.6 movie maker, which can be inserted into PowerPoint presentations. As a result, the cerebral cortex virtual model has the potential to be used for online distance anatomical learning, which has become the adopted method of teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The flexibility of this model allows it to also be used in the classroom setting as a virtual learning tool where students may view the models via a 3D screen with 3D glasses.","Patel, Shiv Patel Niki Yang Gongchao Cui Dongmei",The FASEB Journal,,250

To examine how different inhibitory receptors are regulated, we carried out dual-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) of GlyRs and GABAA Rs at mixed inhibitory synapses in spinal cord neurons. We show that endogenous GlyRs and GABAA Rs as well as their common scaffold protein gephyrin form SSDs that align with pre-synaptic RIM1/2, thus creating trans-synaptic nanocolumns. Strikingly, GlyRs and GABAA Rs occupy different sub-synaptic spaces, exhibiting only a partial overlap at mixed inhibitory synapses. When network activity is increased by 4-aminopyridine treatment, the GABAA R copy numbers and the number of GABAA R SSDs are reduced, while GlyRs remain largely unchanged. This differential regulation is likely the result of changes in gephyrin phosphorylation that preferentially occurs outside of SSDs. The activity-dependent regulation of GABAA Rs versus GlyRs suggests that different signaling pathways control the receptors' sub-synaptic clustering. Taken together, our data reinforce the notion that the precise sub-synaptic organization of GlyRs, GABAA Rs, and gephyrin has functional consequences for the plasticity of mixed inhibitory synapses.","Yang, Xiaojuan; Le Corronc, Hervé; Legendre, Pascal; Triller, Antoine; Specht, Christian G",EMBO Rep,,250

As found in adults, signs and symptoms related to the disease mainly involve the respiratory tract in the paediatric population. However, a considerable number of children present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The purpose of this review is an accurate description, from pathogenesis to clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment, of COVID-19 effects on the gastrointestinal system at a paediatric age. SARS-CoV-2 can be identified in stool specimens of affected children by real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. Positivity can last for several weeks after the end of the symptomatic phase. Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms are generally self-limited, can correlate with blood tests and imaging alterations, and may require supportive treatment such as hydration. However, they can precede severe disease manifestations such as the COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Children belonging to risk categories such as those affected by celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatic disease seem to not have a more severe course than the others, even if they are undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Medical follow-ups of patients with chronic diseases need to be revised during the pandemic period in order to postpone unnecessary tests, mainly endoscopic ones.","Calitri, Carmelina; Fumi, Ilaria; Ignaccolo, Maria Giovanna; Banino, Elena; Benetti, Stefania; Lupica, Maria Maddalena; Fantone, Francesca; Pace, Mariella; Garofalo, Franco",World J Gastroenterol,,250

This study aims to quantify aerosol and droplet generation from mandibular and midface open fixation and measure mitigation of airborne particles by a smoke evacuating electrocautery hand piece. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The soft tissue of the bilateral mandible and midface of two fresh frozen cadaveric specimens was infiltrated using a 0.1% fluorescein solution. Surgical fixation via oral vestibular approach was performed on each of these sites. Droplet splatter on the surgeon's chest, facemask, and up to 198.12 cm (6.5 ft) away from each surgical site was measured against a blue background under ultraviolet-A (UV-A) light. Aerosol generation was measured using an optical particle sizer. RESULTS: No visible droplet contamination was observed for any trials of mandible or midface fixation. Total aerosolized particle counts from 0.300-10.000 µm were increased compared to baseline following each use of standard electrocautery (n = 4, p < 0.001) but not with use of a suction evacuating electrocautery hand piece (n = 4, p = 0.103). Total particle counts were also increased during use of the powered drill (n = 8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Risk from visible droplets during mandible and midface fixation is low.

Iodine deficiency is common in pregnant women in the United States. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of â¼2.5 million births in California to determine whether iodine status is related to CH in a US population. METHODS: Dried blood spots from 907 newborns with CH identified by newborn screening and 909 unaffected controls matched by month of birth were obtained from the California Newborn Screening Program to measure whole-blood iodine concentration. Iodine status was compared between cases and controls, and logistic regression was used to assess the association between CH status and blood iodine concentrations. Iodine status was also compared between cases and controls among infants treated in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) because CH has been reported in infants exposed to high levels of iodine in the NICU. RESULTS: Blood iodine concentrations did not differ significantly between cases (median: 20.0 ng/mL; IQR: 12.1-29.8 ng/mL) and controls (median: 20.3 ng/mL; IQR: 12.5-30.9 ng/mL; P = 0.59). Neither extremely high nor extremely low blood iodine concentrations (1st, 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of the distribution) were more common in cases. Among infants treated in NICUs, however, cases had significantly (P = 0.01) higher iodine (median: 22.7 ng/mL; IQR: 16.4-32.1 ng/mL) compared with controls (median: 17.3 ng/mL; IQR: 8.3-26.6 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: CH cases did not have significantly higher or lower iodine in this population, which is reassuring given that maternal iodine deficiency is common in the United States. Among newborns in the NICU, CH cases had higher blood iodine concentrations compared with controls, suggesting that excess iodine exposure in the NICU could be causing CH. It may be beneficial to monitor iodine exposure from surgical procedures, imaging, and iodine-containing disinfectants and to consider non-iodine alternatives.","Mills, James L; Reische, Elijah C; Kannan, Kurunthachalam; Gao, Chongjing; Shaw, Gary M; Sundaram, Rajeshwari",J. nutr,,250

218941,Convolution Neural Network Based Infection Transmission Analysis on Covid -19 Using GIS and Covid Data Materials,2021,"In this study, the asymmetric Granger causality relationship between tourist arrivals and world pandemic uncertainty index is examined by controlling inflation, consumer confidence index, and industrial production for the period 2000M1 and 2020M1 in Italy. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is one of the few studies to investigate the relationship between tourist arrivals and world pandemic uncertainty in an asymmetric framework. The empirical results show that using the Granger causality test in a linear framework causes bias results due to misspecification. Therefore, the study relies on asymmetric Granger causality test results which reveal that the positive shock of world pandemic uncertainty Granger causes a negative shock of tourist arrivals. It is suggested that international tourist arrivals are sensitive to external shocks such as pandemics and in such instances the government of the concerned country can insulate the tourism-service and hospitality industry against the shocks by developing strategies to promote full information between all stakeholders.","Uzuner, Gizem; Ghosh, Sudeshna",Qual Quant,,250

219660,The Impact of Covid-19 on Children's Rights,2021,"BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patterns of drug use in the United States. Because drug seizures can serve as a proxy for drug availability, we examined shifts in drug seizures in the US during the pandemic. METHODS: We examined trends in seizures of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl within five High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas-Washington/Baltimore, Chicago, Ohio, New Mexico, and North Florida. Trends were examined for number and total weight of seizures from March 2019 through September 2020 using Joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Significant decreases in seizures involving marijuana (ß = -0.03, P = 0.005) and methamphetamine (ß = -0.02, P = 0.026) were detected through April 2020, and then seizures of marijuana (ß = 0.10, P = 0.028) and methamphetamine (ß = 0.11, P = 0.010) significantly increased through September 2020. The number of seizures involving marijuana and methamphetamine peaked in August 2020, exceeding the highest pre-COVID-19 number of seizures. Fentanyl seizures increased overall (ß = 0.05, P < .001), but did not significantly drop during the start of COVID-19, and significant changes were not detected for cocaine or heroin. We also detected a significant increase in weight of marijuana seized from April through September 2020 (ß = 0.40, P = .001). The weight of marijuana seized in August 2020 exceeded the highest pre-COVID-19 weight. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an immediate decrease in marijuana and methamphetamine seizures, and then increases throughout 2020 with some months exceeding the number (and weights) of seizures from the previous year. More research is warranted to determine the extent to which these seizures reflect changes in drug use.","Palamar, Joseph J; Le, Austin; Carr, Thomas H; Cottler, Linda B",Drug Alcohol Depend,,250

This study sought to examine the impact of COVID-19's stay-at-home order on daily vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and MVCs in Connecticut. METHODS: Using an interrupted time series design, we analysed daily VMT and MVCs stratified by crash severity and number of vehicles involved from 1 January to 30 April 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. MVC data were collected from the Connecticut Crash Data Repository; daily VMT estimates were obtained from StreetLight Insight's database. We used segmented Poisson regression models, controlling for daily temperature and daily precipitation. RESULTS: The mean daily VMT significantly decreased 43% in the post stay-at-home period in 2020. While the mean daily counts of crashes decreased in 2020 after the stay-at-home order was enacted, several types of crash rates increased after accounting for the VMT reductions. Single vehicle crash rates significantly increased 2.29 times, and specifically single vehicle fatal crash rates significantly increased 4.10 times when comparing the pre-stay-at-home and post-stay-at-home periods. DISCUSSION: Despite a decrease in the number of MVCs and VMT, the crash rate of single vehicles increased post stay-at-home order enactment in Connecticut after accounting for reductions in VMT.","Doucette, Mitchell L; Tucker, Andrew; Auguste, Marisa E; Watkins, Amy; Green, Christa; Pereira, Flavia E; Borrup, Kevin T; Shapiro, David; Lapidus, Garry",Inj. prev,,250

221062,Temporal Strategies and Firms’ Speedy Responses to COVID-19,2020,"IntroductionIn randomized controlled trials, single-dose efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 illness exceeded 90% for mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273), and 75% for ChAdOx1. In British Columbia (BC), Canada second doses were deferred up to 16 weeks and ChAdOx1 was only initially recommended for adults 55 years of age and older. We compared single-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) during the spring 2021 wave in BC when Alpha and Gamma variants of concern (VOC) predominated. MethodsVE was estimated against infection and hospitalization by test-negative design: cases were RT-PCR test-positive for SARS-CoV-2 and controls were test-negative. Adults 50-69 years old with specimen collection between April 4 and May 22 (weeks 14-20) were included. Variant-specific VE was estimated between weeks 17-20 when genetic characterization of all case viruses was performed, primarily through whole genome sequencing. ResultsVE analyses included 7,116 (10%) cases and 60,958 controls. Three-quarters of vaccinated participants received mRNA vaccine (60% BNT162b2, 15% mRNA-1273) and 25% received ChAdOx1. Half of genetically characterized viruses were Alpha, with 38% Gamma, 4% Delta and 8% non-VOCs. Single-dose VE against any infection was 75% (95%CI: 72-78) for BNT162b2, 82% (95%CI: 76-87) for mRNA-1273 and 61% (95%CI: 54-66) for ChAdOx1. VE against hospitalization was 83% (95%CI: 76-89), 85% (95%CI: 63-94) and 96% (95%CI: 86-99), respectively. VE against Alpha vs. Gamma infections did not differ among mRNA (78%;95%CI: 73-82 and 80%;95%CI: 74-85) or ChAdOx1 (66%;95%CI: 57-74 and 60%;95%CI: 48-69) recipients. ConclusionsA single dose of mRNA vaccine reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk by at least 75%, including infections due to early VOC. Although effectiveness of a single dose of ChAdOx1 was lower at 60% against infection, just one dose of any vaccine reduced the hospitalization risk by more than 80%. In the context of constrained vaccine supplies, these findings have implications for global vaccine deployment to reduce the overall burden of infections and hospitalizations due to SARS-CoV-2.","Skowronski, Danuta M; Setayeshgar, Solmaz; Zou, Macy; Prystajecky, Natalie; Tyson, John R; Sbihi, Hind; Fjell, Chris D; Galanis, Eleni; Naus, Monika; Patrick, David M; Adam, Shiraz El; Ahmed, May; Kim, Shinhye; Henry, Bonnie; Hoang, Linda; Sadarangani, Manish; Jassem, Agathat N; Krajden, Mel",,,250

It has impacted all aspects of life and all segments of populations, including already vulnerable health care providers. AIMS: This study sought to detect the prevalence of mental health issues in sample of physicians and nurses working in several health facilities in Oman. METHOD: We gauged the mental health conditions of 509 physicians (38.1%) and nurses (61.9 %) using the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and World Health Organization Well-Being Index. RESULTS: The study revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety and poor psychological well-being, especially among females, young health care workers and those who interacted with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study support the handful of studies published during this global health crisis that have found that the mental health of health care workers has been harshly affected and predicted that it will continue, to various degrees, to be affected in the foreseeable future. The results of this study highlight the urgency of providing administrative and psychological support as well as current and accurate information on COVID-19 to health care workers.","Badahdah, Abdallah; Khamis, Faryal; Al Mahyijari, Nawal; Al Balushi, Marwa; Al Hatmi, Hashil; Al Salmi, Issa; Albulushi, Zakariya; Al Noomani, Jaleela",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,250

Because of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, our institution noted a significant decline in the number of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage presenting to the hospital. We report one such example of a patient who developed new-onset severe headache and vomiting and did not seek medical attention because of COVID-19. Two months later, she was noted to have ptosis during a routine follow-up and was found to have a complete, pupil-involving third nerve palsy. Computed tomography angiography was performed and revealed an irregular bilobed saccular aneurysm (7 × 9 × 5 mm) of the right posterior communicating (PComm) artery, but no acute hemorrhage was visible on CT. On MRI, immediately adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a small subacute hematoma in the right medial temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema. This case had a fortunate and unique outcome as she had a contained hematoma adjacent to the ruptured PComm aneurysm and did not experience severe morbidity from the subarachnoid hemorrhage nor did she rebleed in the interval in which she did not seek care. This case highlights the importance of providing neuro-ophthalmic care even during a pandemic.","Dhoot, Arjan S; Guest, William C; Bharatha, Aditya; Micieli, Jonathan A",J. neuro-ophthalmol,,250

As MIS-C combines clinical features of Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), we aimed to compare the immunological profile of pediatric patients with these different conditions. We analyzed blood cytokine expression, and the T cell repertoire and phenotype in 36 MIS-C cases, which were compared to 16 KD, 58 TSS, and 42 COVID-19 cases. We observed an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, IFNÎ³, CD25s, MCP1, IL-1RA) in MIS-C, TSS and KD, contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes. We detected a specific expansion of activated T cells expressing the Vß21.3 T cell receptor ß chain variable region in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in 75% of MIS-C patients and not in any patient with TSS, KD, or acute COVID-19; this correlated with the cytokine storm detected. The T cell repertoire returned to baseline within weeks after MIS-C resolution. Vß21.3+ T cells from MIS-C patients expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD38 and CX3CR1 but had weak responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro. Consistently, the T cell expansion was not associated with specific classical HLA alleles. Thus, our data suggested that MIS-C is characterized by a polyclonal Vß21.3 T cell expansion not directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic peptides, which is not seen in KD, TSS and acute COVID-19.","Moreews, Marion; Le Gouge, Kenz; Khaldi-Plassart, Samira; Pescarmona, Rémi; Mathieu, Anne-Laure; Malcus, Christophe; Djebali, Sophia; Bellomo, Alicia; Dauwalder, Olivier; Perret, Magali; Villard, Marine; Chopin, Emilie; Rouvet, Isabelle; Vandenesh, Francois; Dupieux, Céline; Pouyau, Robin; Teyssedre, Sonia; Guerder, Margaux; Louazon, Tiphaine; Moulin-Zinsch, Anne; Duperril, Marie; Patural, Hugues; Giovannini-Chami, Lisa; Portefaix, Aurélie; Kassai, Behrouz; Venet, Fabienne; Monneret, Guillaume; Lombard, Christine; Flodrops, Hugues; De Guillebon, Jean-Marie; Bajolle, Fanny; Launay, Valérie; Bastard, Paul; Zhang, Shen-Ying; Dubois, Valérie; Thaunat, Olivier; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Mezidi, Mehdi; Allatif, Omran; Saker, Kahina; Dreux, Marlène; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Marvel, Jacqueline; Trouillet-Assant, Sophie; Klatzmann, David; Walzer, Thierry; Mariotti-Ferrandiz, Encarnita; Javouhey, Etienne; Belot, Alexandre",Sci. immunol,,250

In contrast to the small effect of the weekend, there was a strong holiday effect throughout the region with average increases of about 22% in PM2.5 and average reductions of about 11% in NO2 concentrations. There was a clear geographical pattern in the strength of the holiday effect. In rural areas the increase in PM2.5 is related to the proportion of coal and biomass consumption for household heating. In the suburban areas between the Fifth Ring Road and Sixth Ring Road there were larger reductions in NO2 than downtown which might be due to decreased traffic as many people return to their hometown for the holidays. This study provides insights into the pattern of changes in air pollution due to human activities. By quantifying the changes, it also provides insights for improvements in air quality due to control policies implemented in Beijing during the heating season.","Hua, Jinxi; Zhang, Yuanxun; de Foy, Benjamin; Mei, Xiaodong; Shang, Jing; Feng, Chuan",Sci Total Environ,,250

225414,And Justice for None: How Covid-19 Is Crippling the Criminal Jury Right,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has affected routine immunization globally. Impact will likely be higher in low and middle-income countries with limited healthcare resources and fragile health systems. We quantified the impact, spatial heterogeneity, and determinants for childhood immunizations of 48 million population affected in the Sindh province of Pakistan. METHODS: We extracted individual immunization records from real-time provincial Electronic Immunization Registry from September 23, 2019, to July 11, 2020. Comparing baseline (6 months preceding the lockdown) and the COVID-19 lockdown period, we analyzed the impact on daily immunization coverage rate for each antigen by geographical area. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore the predictors associated with immunizations during the lockdown. RESULTS: There was a 52.5% decline in the daily average total number of vaccinations administered during lockdown compared to baseline. The highest decline was seen for Bacille Cal-mette Guérin (BCG) (40.6% (958/2360) immunization at fixed sites. Around 8438 children/day were missing immunization during the lockdown. Enrollments declined furthest in rural districts, urban sub-districts with large slums, and polio-endemic super high-risk sub-districts. Pentavalent-3 (penta-3) immunization rates were higher in infants born in hospitals (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04-1.15) and those with mothers having higher education (RR: 1.19-1.50; 95% CI: 1.13-1.65). Likelihood of penta-3 immunization was reduced by 5% for each week of delayed enrollment into the immunization program. CONCLUSION: One out of every two children in Sindh province has missed their routine vaccinations during the provincial COVID-19 lockdown. The pool of un-immunized children is expanding during lockdown, leaving them susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases. There is a need for tailored interventions to promote immunization visits and safe service delivery. Higher maternal education, facility-based births, and early enrollment into the immunization program continue to show a positive association with immunization uptake, even during a challenging lockdown.","Chandir, Subhash; Siddiqi, Danya Arif; Mehmood, Mariam; Setayesh, Hamidreza; Siddique, Muhammad; Mirza, Amna; Soundardjee, Riswana; Dharma, Vijay Kumar; Shah, Mubarak Taighoon; Abdullah, Sara; Akhter, Mohammed Adil; Ali Khan, Anokhi; Khan, Aamir Javed",Vaccine,,250

228045,Bluetooth-based COVID-19 Proximity Tracing Proposals: An Overview,2020-08-28,"When facing an extreme stressor, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems typically respond reactively by creating surge capacity at facilities that are at or approaching their baseline capacity. However, creating individual capacity at each facility is not necessarily the optimal approach, and redistributing demand and critical resources between facilities can reduce the total required capacity. Data shows that this additional load was unevenly distributed between hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring some to create surge capacity while nearby hospitals had unused capacity. Not only is this inefficient, but it also could lead to a decreased quality of care at over-capacity hospitals. In this work, we study the problem of finding optimal demand and resource transfers to minimize the required surge capacity and resource shortage during a period of heightened demand. We develop and analyze a series of linear and mixed-integer programming models that solve variants of the demand and resource redistribution problem. We additionally consider demand uncertainty and use robust optimization to ensure solution feasibility. We also incorporate a range of operational constraints and costs that decision-makers may need to consider when implementing such a scheme. Our models are validated retrospectively using COVID-19 hospitalization data from New Jersey, Texas, and Miami, yielding at least an 85% reduction in required surge capacity relative to the observed outcome of each case. Results show that such solutions are operationally feasible and sufficiently robust against demand uncertainty. In summary, this work provides decision-makers in healthcare systems with a practical and flexible tool to reduce the surge capacity necessary to properly care for patients in cases when some facilities are over capacity.","Parker, Felix; Sawczuk, Hamilton; Ganjkhanloo, Fardin; Ahmadi, Farzin; Ghobadi, Kimia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03528v1.pdf,250
228294,Image analysis and data processing for COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults are indisputably struck hard by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The main objective of this meta-analysis is to establish the association between delirium and mortality in older adults with COVID-19. METHODS: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were performed up until 28 November 2020. The exposure in this study was the diagnosis of delirium using clinically validated criteria. Delirium might be in-hospital, at admission, or both. The main outcome was mortality defined as clinically validated non-survivor/death. The effect estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: A total of 3,868 patients from 9 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The percentage of patients with delirium was 27% [20%, 34%]. Every 1 mg/L increase in CRP was significantly associated with 1% increased delirium risk (OR 1.01 [1.00. 1.02], p=0.033). Delirium was associated with mortality (OR 2.39 [1.64, 3.49], p<0.001; I2: 82.88%). Subgroup analysis on delirium assessed at admission indicate independent association (OR 2.12 [1.39, 3.25], p<0.001; I2: 82.67%). Pooled adjusted analysis indicated that delirium was independently associated with mortality (aOR 1.50 [1.16, 1.94], p=0.002; I2: 31.02%). Subgroup analysis on delirium assessed at admission indicate independent association (OR 1.40 [1.03, 1.90], p=0.030; I2: 35.19%). Meta-regression indicates that the association between delirium and mortality were not significantly influenced by study-level variations in age, sex [reference: male], hypertension, diabetes, and dementia. CONCLUSION: The presence of delirium is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized older adults with COVID-19.","Pranata, Raymond; Huang, Ian; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Yonas, Emir; Vania, Rachel; Kuswardhani, Raden Ayu Tuty",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,250

(2) Materials and methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed on PubMed, Medline and Scopus until 10 July. (3) Results: Chemicals, carcinogens and biologically active materials, such as bacteria and viruses, have been isolated in surgical smoke. However, the only evidence of viral transmission through surgical smoke to medical staff is post-laser ablation of HPV-positive genital warts. The reports of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery revealed the presence of the virus, when tested, in digestive wall and stools in 50% of cases but not in bile or peritoneal fluid. All surgeries did not result in contamination of the personnel, when protective measures were applied, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and filtration of the pneumoperitoneum. There are no comparative studies between classical and laparoscopic surgery. (4) Conclusions: Previously published data showed there is a possible infectious and toxic risk related to surgical smoke but not particularly proven for SARS-CoV-2. Implementing standardized filtration systems for smoke evacuation during laparoscopy, although increases costs, is necessary to increase the safety and it will probably remain a routine also in the future.","Serban, Dragos; Smarandache, Catalin Gabriel; Tudor, Corneliu; Duta, Lucian Nicolae; Dascalu, Ana Maria; Alius, Cătălin",Diagn.,,250

METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study included 275 patients who tested COVID-19 positive via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay at our institution and who survived the index hospitalization. OUTCOMES: Main outcomes were 1-month and 6-month readmission rates after an index hospitalization for COVID-19. Mortality rate among the readmitted patients was also determined. Factors independently associated with readmission were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A final sample of 275 patients were included. The mean age was 64.69 ±14.64 (SD) 133 (48%) were female and 194 (70%) were African American. Their chronic medical conditions included hypertension 203 (74%) and diabetes mellitus 121 (44%). After the hospitalization, 1-month readmission rate was 7.6%, while 6-month readmission rate was 24%. 9% of patients who were readmitted subsequently died. Coronary artery disease (CAD) was significantly associated with 6-month readmission OR 2.15 (95% CI 1.04-4.44; p=0.039) after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity and comorbidities. Readmissions were due to cardiac, respiratory, and musculoskeletal symptoms. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with increased readmission OR 3.16 (95% CI 1.01-9.88; p=0.048). No significant difference was found between inflammatory markers or clinical outcomes during the index hospitalization among patients who were readmitted compared to those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may be readmitted. Presence of CAD is independently associated with high rates of 6-month readmission.

Because of the worldwide shortage of ICU beds, a relatively high number of patients with respiratory failure are receiving prolonged noninvasive respiratory support, even when their clinical status would have required invasive mechanical ventilation. There are few experimental and clinical data reporting that vigorous breathing effort during spontaneous ventilation can worsen lung injury and cause a phenomenon that has been termed patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of P-SILI pathophysiology and the role of noninvasive respiratory support in COVID-19 pneumonia. Respiratory mechanics, vascular compromise, viscoelastic properties, lung inhomogeneity, work of breathing, and oesophageal pressure swings are discussed. The concept of P-SILI has been widely investigated in recent years, but controversies persist regarding its mechanisms. To minimise the risk of P-SILI, intensivists should better understand its underlying pathophysiology to optimise the type of noninvasive respiratory support provided to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and decide on the optimal timing of intubation for these patients.","Battaglini, Denise; Robba, Chiara; Ball, Lorenzo; Silva, Pedro L; Cruz, Fernanda F; Pelosi, Paolo; Rocco, Patricia R M",Br. j. anaesth,,250

In this paper, we scrutinize the effect of intuitive decisions/judgments as well as personality differences on consumers’ intentions to consume less. More specifically, we study how the availability heuristic, herding biases, and self-monitoring influence environmentally motivated consumption reduction (EMCR) in a tourism context. Drawing on EMCR and a heuristics-and-biases approach, we present an experimental study designed to test how availability (high vs. low information availability), herding behavior (herd present vs. no herd), and high vs. low self-monitoring influence consumers’ intentions to travel less in the future. The results suggest that the existence of a herd influence environmentally motivated travel reductions. Also, high self-monitors are more capable of sensing the eco-friendly direction of the public opinion in general, and adjust their behavior to align with this, than individuals with a lower self-monitoring tendency. Finally, there is a positive interaction between herding bias and self-monitoring, while we found no significant effect of the availability heuristic on the environmentally motivated travel reduction.

Historically it has been the drug of choice for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis global elimination programs. IVM is an oral insecticide and is a standard treatment against intestinal helminths and ectoparasites. The current humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is a regional public health threat that requires immediate action. The public health system in Venezuela has crumbled because of a 70% shortage of medicines in public hospitals, low vaccination campaigns, and the mass exodus of medical personnel. Herein we discuss the repurposing of IVM to attenuate the burden imposed by the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Venezuela, including soil-transmitted helminths, ectoparasites and, possibly, vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. In addition, novel experimental evidence has shown that IVM is active and efficacious in vitro against Chagas disease, Leishmaniases, arboviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. In crisis-hit Venezuela, all these infectious diseases are public health emergencies that have long been ignored and require immediate attention. The versatility of IVM could serve as a powerful tool to tackle the multiple overlapping endemic and emergent diseases that currently affect Venezuela. The repurposing of this multipurpose drug would be a timely therapeutic approach to help mitigate the tremendous burden of NTDs nationwide.","Perez-Garcia, Luis A; Mejias-Carpio, Isis E; Delgado-Noguera, Lourdes A; Manzanarez-Motezuma, Jean P; Escalona-Rodriguez, Maria A; Sordillo, Emilia M; Mogollon-Rodriguez, Euler A; Hernandez-Pereira, Carlos E; Marquez-Colmenarez, Marilianna C; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto E",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,250

In addition to the changes in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) guidelines, there has been evidence of rapid adoption of telehealth services. In April of 2020, the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute released a report stating that 1 in 4 dentists nationally were utilizing teledentistry to perform limited evaluations. Many of these dentists are new to teledentistry, and unfortunately, direct-to-patient consultations yield limited clinical outcomes. The more traditional methods of using teledentistry have been extending the reach of dental care for over a decade, using an allied team member such as a dental hygienist or expanded-function dental assistant. As dentistry adapts to this new environment, it is important that there be adequate awareness of the diverse uses of teledentistry to meet the needs of the population. This brief, outlines one dental clinic's attempt at providing a broad use of teledentistry.","Suter, Nathan",J Public Health Dent,,250

In this study, VCM was employed to analyze the viscoelastic profiles of 36 COVID-19 intensive care patients. Full anticoagulant dose heparin (unfractionated [UFH]; low molecular weight [LMWH]) was administrated to all patients. The association between VCM and laboratory parameters was retrospectively analyzed. The administration of UFH-influenced VCM parameters prolonging clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT) and reducing angle (alpha) and amplitudes of the VCM tracings (A10, A20, and maximum clot firmness [MCF]) compared with LMWH therapy. A tendency toward hypercoagulation was observed by short CT and CFT in patients receiving LMWH. Clotting time was correlated with UFH dose (Spearman's rho = 0.48, p &#8804; 0.001), and no correlation was found between CT and LMWH. All VCM tracings failed to show lysis at 30 and 45 minutes, indicating the absence of fibrinolysis. A10, A20, and MCF exhibited very-good to good diagnostic accuracy for detecting platelet count and fibrinogen above the upper reference limit of the laboratory. In conclusion, VCM provided reliable results in COVID-19 patients and was easy to perform with minimal training at the bedside.","Panigada, Mauro; Meli, Andrea; Scotti, Eleonora; Properzi, Paolo; Brioni, Matteo; Kamel, Shady; Ghirardello, Stefano; Scudeller, Luigia; Dalton, Heidi J; Grasselli, Giacomo",ASAIO J,,250
234546,Crowd Size using CommSense Instrument for COVID-19 Echo Period,2020,"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic induced a suppressive environment for healthcare professionals and patients, especially during the lockdown period. Except for the direct burden of the COVID-19, collateral damage has been identified concerning other diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of the lockdown on the non-COVID-19 patients' outcome in a tertiary gastroenterology department. Methods: Patients admitted to our department during the lockdown period (23 March- 4 May 2020) and during the respective previous year's timeframe were recruited. Sex, age, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, final diagnosis, therapeutic management, duration of hospitalization, and outcome were evaluated. A direct comparison was performed to investigate the potential impact of the lockdown on the duration of hospitalization and the final outcome. Results: A total of 161 patients were included to our analysis with 1:1 male:female ratio and mean age 70.86 years. Most of the cases experienced gastrointestinal tract bleeding, biliary stone disease manifestations, or gastrointestinal malignancy complications, and 85.1% were discharged. Fewer patients were hospitalized during the lockdown period (40%), whereas the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer (7.69+/-4.55 vs. 5.76+/-4.36 days). Binary logistic regression analysis and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the quarantine was associated with increased prevalence of negative outcomes (odds ratio 5.21, 95% confidence interval 1.66-16.34;P=0.005), especially in cases with gastrointestinal malignancy and acute pancreatitis (P=0.045 and P=0.041, respectively). Conclusion: The increase in the negative outcomes of common gastrointestinal diseases and the duration of hospitalization during the lockdown raise reasonable concerns regarding healthcare policies against further outbreaks.","Papaefthymiou, A.; Koffas, A.; Kountouras, J.; Doulberis, M.; Kaltsa, A.; Tsiopoulos, F.; Christodoulidis, G.; Kapsoritakis, A.; Potamianos, S.",Annals of Gastroenterology,,250

As a species more fragile than we often allow, humans would be expected to adversely react to these types of disasters in terms of mental ill health and possibly suicidal behaviour leading to increased demands on the Mental Health services. This narrative historical paper examines relevant studies into how previous disasters affected mental health and suicidal behaviour. The characteristics of what is known of the current Covid-19 disease are analysed and compared to other types of disasters with a view to gaining some insight into what we might expect. Of all the types of disasters, economic recession appears most toxic. Mitigating the worst effects of recession appears to be protective.

We aimed to explore the predictive role of male serum total testosterone (TT) levels on the time till viral negativity testing among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: The univariate effect of risk factors for the duration of COVID-19 viral positivity was evaluated using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier estimates. A multivariable Cox regression model was developed to test the role of TT levels and the subsequent odds for shorter viral positivity intervals. Results: Increasing serum TT levels and the need for an oxygen administration strategy were independently predictive for respectively reduced and increased days to negativization (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.95-2.03 and HR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.03-1.18). Conclusion: Baseline higher TT levels for male COVID-19 patients at hospital admission are associated with shorter durations of positive COVID-19 testing and thus viral clearance.

236690,Some reflections on ethical care dilemmas in a pandemic environment,2020,"COVID-19 outbreak has significantly upended solid organ transplant (SOT) practice around the world. Early reports confirmed the heavy burden of COVID-19 in SOT recipients with mortality rates reaching up to 35%. Because most transplant recipients harbored multiple comorbidities known to be associated with a severe course of COVID-19, the true impact of immunosuppression by itself remained an unsolved issue. Transplant societies have initially recommended to postpone non urgent renal transplantations, while trying to maintain life-saving transplant programs, such as heart, lung and liver transplantations. The pandemic thus resulted in an unprecedented and sudden drop of transplant activity worldwide. Moreover, the best treatment strategy in infected patients was challenging. Both reduction of immunosuppression and use of targeted therapies aiming at counteracting SARS-CoV-2 infection were the two faces of the therapeutic armamentarium. Recent controlled studies have better delineated the basis of mitigating and management strategies to improve patients' outcome. Nevertheless, and given the persistence of circulating virus, evidence-based recommendations in SOT recipients remain unclear. The resumption of transplant activity should be tailored with careful selection of both donors and recipients. Transplant decision should be made on a case-by-case basis after thorough assessment of the risks and benefits.","Zaidan, Mohamad; Legendre, Christophe",Transplantation,,250

High Alt Med Biol. 21:217-222, 2020.-The rapid transmission, increased morbidity, and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exhausted many health care systems and the global economy. Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations. In this review, we critically examine these factors and attempt to determine based upon available scientific and epidemiological data whether living in high-altitude regions might be protective against COVID-19 as recent publications have claimed.","Pun, Matiram; Turner, Rachel; Strapazzon, Giacomo; Brugger, Hermann; Swenson, Erik R",High Alt Med Biol,,250

With little to no direct access to hospital data, the AI community relies heavily on public data comprising numerous data sources. Model performance results have been exceptional when training and testing on open-source data, surpassing the reported capabilities of AI in pneumonia-detection prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. In this study impactful models are trained on a widely used open-source data and tested on an external test set and a hospital dataset, for the task of classifying chest X-rays into one of three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID pneumonia and no-pneumonia. Classification performance of the models investigated is evaluated through ROC curves, confusion matrices and standard classification metrics. Explainability modules are implemented to explore the image features most important to classification. Data analysis and model evaluations show that the popular open-source dataset COVIDx is not representative of the real clinical problem and that results from testing on this are inflated. Dependence on open-source data can leave models vulnerable to bias and confounding variables, requiring careful analysis to develop clinically useful/viable AI tools for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays.","Harkness, Rachael; Hall, Geoff; Frangi, Alejandro F; Ravikumar, Nishant; Zucker, Kieran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08020v1.pdf,250

242991,Why COVID-19 models should incorporate the network of social interactions,2020,"One of the multi-facet impacts of lockdowns during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic was restricted economic and transport activities. This has resulted in the reduction of air pollution concentrations observed globally. This study is aimed at examining the concentration changes in air pollutants (i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) during the period March-April 2020. Data from both satellite observations (for NO2) and ground-based measurements (for all other pollutants) were utilized to analyze the changes when compared against the same months between 2015-2019. Globally, space borne NO2 column observations observed by satellite (OMI on Aura) were reduced by approximately 9.19% and 9.57%, in March and April 2020, respectively because of public health measures enforced to contain the coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19). On a regional scale and after accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, most monitoring sites in Europe, USA, China, and India showed declines in CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations during the period of analysis. An increase in O3 concentrations occurred during the same period. Meanwhile, four major cities case studies i.e. in New York City (USA), Milan (Italy), Wuhan (China), and New Delhi (India) have also shown a similar reduction trends as observed on the regional scale, and an increase in ozone concentration. This study highlights that the reductions in air pollutant concentrations have overall improved global air quality likely driven in part by economic slowdowns resulting from the global pandemic.","Bray, Casey D; Nahas, Alberth; Battye, William H; Aneja, Viney P",Atmos Environ (1994),,250

243820,Clustering Patterns Connecting COVID-19 Dynamics and Human Mobility Using Optimal Transport,2021,"Introduction The start of the Covid-19 pandemic placed an unprecedented demand on health systems to rapidly shift ambulatory in-person care to virtual care Geriatric patients, at increased risk of morbidly and mortality from Covid-19 infection, face more challenges with video visit access compared to younger patients due to discomfort with technology and less access to necessary devices and broadband internet Thus, it is a priority to enhance remote connections between geriatric patients and their providers Methods The aim of this project was to facilitate the transition to video telemedicine for the geriatric population by creating a well-organized training program for volunteers to guide patients and caregivers to make the conversion from phone to video visits A 28-page volunteer manual was created that included a structured process for how to call patients, including our three-call model, a walk-through of the video modalities, an algorithm for choosing which modality is best for each patient (Figure 1), and troubleshooting resources Virtual training sessions oriented volunteers to the process and connected them with the faculty they would work with for the duration of the project Volunteers provided patients with one-to-one remote guidance, identifying and overcoming barriers, with practice sessions to increase comfort with the technology Initial volunteer work began in the Michigan Medicine Geriatric Psychiatry Clinic With expansion of our team to 26 total individuals we also began servicing the Michigan Medicine Geriatric General Medicine Clinics Quantitatively, we measured the proportion of video visits before and after intervention with the program Qualitatively, we solicited feedback from providers, patients, and volunteers Results The GET Access Program volunteers were successful in teaching and converting many visits to video that the schedulers were unable to do on a first pass Of 95 contacted patients, 80 agreed to participate, and 71 switched from a phone visit to video visit, representing a conversion rate of 88 75% from phone to video visits During a 10-week evaluation period of the two clinics GET Access serviced, 1942 patients had 2865 visits Of 59 providers within the clinics studied, 12 providers with the lowest video visit rates received help from GET Access Averaged over the evaluation period, visits after participation in the program were associated with video format 43% compared to 19 2% for visits prior to participation (adjusted OR 3 38 [95% CI 2 49, 4 59]) and visit by non-participating providers (32 1%, adjusted OR 1 65 [1 31, 2 08]) as shown in Figure 2 Conclusions A program dedicated to personalized virtual technological instruction and practice helped geriatric patients transition from phone to video visits, to provide a platform for stronger connection with their providers Sustainability of the program beyond the immediate need of it due to Covid-19 was achieved with creation of a robust leadership structure We are currently working with the telehealth administration at Michigan Medicine to expand GET Access to more clinics at Michigan Medicine This expansion will allow our program to service more patients at Michigan Medicine, and results of the extension are expected to be available in March 2021","Pichan, Cayla Merklen Cassidy Anderson Clare Min Lillian Blazek Mary",The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,,250
243822,Clustering patterns connecting COVID-19 dynamics and Human mobility using optimal transport,2020-07-21,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19, multidisciplinary research focusing on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 infection and the complete recovery is still scarce. With regards to long-term consequences, biomarkers of physiological effects as well as the psychological experiences are of significant importance for comprehensively understanding the complete COVID-19 recovery. The present research surveys the IgG antibody titers and the impact of COVID-19 as a traumatic experience in the aftermath of the active infection period, around 2 months after diagnosis, in a subset of COVID-19 patients from the first wave (March-April 2020) of the outbreak in Northern Cyprus. Associations of antibody titers and psychological survey measures with baseline characteristics and disease severity were explored, and correlations among various measures were evaluated. Of the 47 serology tests conducted for presence of IgG antibodies, 39 (83%) were positive. We identified trends demonstrating individuals experiencing severe or critical COVID-19 disease and/or those with comorbidities are more heavily impacted both physiologically and mentally, with higher IgG titers and negative psychological experience compared to those with milder disease and without comorbidities. We also observed that more than half of the COVID-19 cases had negative psychological experiences, being subjected to discrimination and verbal harassment/insult, by family/friends. In summary, as the first study co-evaluating immune response together with mental status in COVID-19, our findings suggest that further multidisciplinary research in larger sample populations as well as community intervention plans are needed to holistically address the physiological and psychological effects of COVID-19 among the cases.","Barin, Burc; Yoldascan, Banu Elcin; Savaskan, Fatma; Ozbalikci, Goncagul; Karaderi, Tugce; Çakal, Hüseyin",Front Public Health,,250

244130,Nursing Science and COVID-19,2020,"Fibrosis is a hallmark of aging tissues which often leads to altered architecture and function. The ovary is the first organ to show overt signs of aging, including increased fibrosis in the ovarian stroma. How this fibrosis affects ovarian biomechanics and the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using instrumental indentation, we demonstrated a quantitative increase in ovarian stiffness, as evidenced by an increase in Young's modulus, when comparing ovaries from reproductively young (6-12 weeks) and old (14-17 months) mice. This ovarian stiffness was dependent on collagen because ex vivo enzyme-mediated collagen depletion in ovaries from reproductively old mice restored their collagen content and biomechanical properties to those of young controls. In addition to collagen, we also investigated the role of hyaluronan (HA) in regulating ovarian stiffness. HA is an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan that maintains tissue homeostasis, and its loss can change the biomechanical properties of tissues. The total HA content in the ovarian stroma decreased with age, and this was associated with increased hyaluronidase (Hyal1) and decreased hyaluronan synthase (Has3) expression. These gene expression differences were not accompanied by changes in ovarian HA molecular mass distribution. Furthermore, ovaries from mice deficient in HAS3 were stiffer compared to age-matched WT mice. Our results demonstrate that the ovary becomes stiffer with age and that both collagen and HA matrices are contributing mechanisms regulating ovarian biomechanics. Importantly, the age-associated increase in collagen and decrease in HA are conserved in the human ovary and may impact follicle development and oocyte quality.","Amargant, Farners; Manuel, Sharrón L; Tu, Qing; Parkes, Wendena S; Rivas, Felipe; Zhou, Luhan T; Rowley, Jennifer E; Villanueva, Cecilia E; Hornick, Jessica E; Shekhawat, Gajendra S; Wei, Jian-Jun; Pavone, Mary Ellen; Hall, Adam R; Pritchard, Michele T; Duncan, Francesca E",Aging Cell,,250

244391,The COVID-19 test of the United Nations Security Council,2021,"The COVID-19 crisis necessitated abrupt transition to remote learning in medical schools. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on French undergraduate students and teachers, to identify practice changes, and to evaluate successes and areas for improvement of this remote learning experience. Data from 2 online questionnaires were analyzed with 509 participants among students and 189 among teachers from Sorbonne University. Responses to multiple choice, Likert response scale, and open-ended questions were evaluated. COVID-19 had negative impact on teaching continuity. Sixty-seven percent of students were in a dropout situation, and many suffered from psychological stress, leading to set up of a psychological support unit. Although most teachers (81%) and students (72%) had limited knowledge of digital resources, distance learning was quickly implemented, with a predominant use of Zoom. The analysis of several parameters revealed that students were significantly more satisfied than teachers by remote learning. Nevertheless, both students and teachers agreed to replace classical lectures by digital media and to promote in-person teaching in small interactive groups. This paper shares tips for faculty rapidly establishing remote learning. This comparative study of the students' and teachers' points of view underlines that new medical curricula should include more digital contents. We make recommendations regarding general university organization, equipment, and curricular development for long-term implementation of digital resources with reinforced relationships between faculty and students.","Vatier, Camille; Carrié, Alain; Renaud, Marie-Christine; Simon-Tillaux, Noémie; Hertig, Alexandre; Jéru, Isabelle",Adv Physiol Educ,,250

A prospective cross-sectional study of 83 informal caregivers was included. The characteristics of informal caregivers as well as their QOL assessment by the Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI) were measured, respectively. Single-factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were carried out to explore the independent influence factors of QOL of caregiver on caring for patient with chronic wound. 62.65% of the caregivers were female with a mean age of (54.24 ± 12.6) years, and 34.9% of the caregivers were parents. The mean FDLQI score was 13.01 ± 7.53 at a high level. The following variables influenced the FDLQI scores of caregivers: self-care ability of patients, patient's satisfaction of home-based wound care, and home-based wound care need of caregivers. The model was able to explain 29.9% of variance in QOL of caregiver (F = 6.561, P = .000, R2 = 0.299, adjusted R2 = 0.253). In conclusion, the impact of chronic wound disease on the QOL of caregivers is heavy during COVID-19 epidemic. Wound professionals are suggested to pay attention to wound care need at home and QOL of caregiver on caring for patients with chronic wound during COVID-19 epidemic and develop tailored wound health education and support programme in order to improve the QOL of caregivers.","Huang, Yao; Mao, Bei Qian; Ni, Peng Wen; Wang, Qi; Xie, Ting; Hou, Lili",Int. wound j,,250

Survey, Taxonomy, and Mitigation Strategies",2020,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is diagnosed if there is venous or arterial thrombosis with thrombocytopenia caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) that activate thrombocytes and is confirmed by a heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) test, occurring 4 to 28 days after vaccination against COVID19. This extremely rare syndrome has been recognized after Astra Zeneca (reporting incidence 0.91 per 100.000) and Janssen vaccins (0.22 per 100.000). Causality with the vaccine is difficult to ascertain if the HIPA test is negative, or if there is severe thrombosis (such as cerebral sinus or splanchnic thrombosis) without thrombocytopenia. Symptoms compatible with thrombosis or bleeding occurring in a specific time window after vaccination should prompt urgent assessment of the thrombocyte count and appropriate diagnostic tests. Heparin-like anticoagulants should be avoided and central laboratory assessment is essential.

The pandemic causes an extreme disease to spread with fluctuating needs among patients, which significantly affect the capacity and overall performance of healthcare systems. In addition, its impact on the sustainability of the entire economic and social system is enormous and certain sustainable management strategies need to be selected. To meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure sustainable performance, national healthcare systems must adapt to new circumstances. This paper proposes an original multi-criteria methodology for the sustainable selection of strategic guidelines for the reorganization of a healthcare system under the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The selection of an appropriate strategic guideline is made on the basis of defined criteria and depending on infection capacity and pandemic spread risk. The criteria for the evaluation of strategic guidelines were defined on the basis of a survey in which the medical personnel engaged in the crisis response team during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Serbia participated. The Level-Based Weight Assessment (LBWA) model and Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical-Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH) method were used to determine the weight coefficient criteria, while a novel fuzzy Ranking of Alternatives through Functional Mapping of Criterion Subintervals into a Single Interval (RAFSI) model was used to evaluate the strategic guidelines. The proposed multi-criteria methodology was tested in a case study in the Republic of Serbia. The validity of the proposed methodology is shown through the simulation of changes in input parameters of Bonferroni aggregation functions and through a comparison with other multi-criteria methodologies.","Pamucar, D.; Zizovic, M.; Marinkovic, D.; Doljanica, D.; Jovanovic, S.

251873,Building back better education systems: equity and COVID-19,2020,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric illness that results in an increased risk for a variety of inflammatory diseases. The exact etiology of this increased risk is unknown, and thus, several animal models have been developed to investigate the neuroimmune interactions of PTSD. Repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) is an established preclinical model of psychological trauma that recapitulates certain behavioral and inflammatory aspects of human PTSD. Furthermore, RSDS has been utilized to subgroup animals into susceptible and resilient populations based on one specific behavioral phenotype (i.e., social interaction). Herein, we conducted an extensive investigation of circulating inflammatory proteins after RSDS and found significant elevations in various cytokines and chemokines after exposure to RSDS. When categorizing animals into either susceptible or resilient populations based on social interaction, we found no inflammatory or other behavioral differences between these subgroups. Furthermore, correlative analyses found no significant correlation between social interaction parameters and inflammation. In contrast, parameters from the elevated zero maze (EZM) demonstrated significant associations and clustering to 5 circulating cytokines. When animals were subdivided into susceptible and resilient populations solely based upon combined EZM performance, significant inflammatory differences were evident between these groups. Strikingly, these circulating inflammatory proteins displayed a stronger predictive ability of EZM performance compared to social interaction test performance. These findings provide new insights into inflammatory markers associated with RSDS, and the utility of EZM to effectively group RSDS-exposed mice into populations with differential levels of peripheral inflammation.","Elkhatib, Safwan K; Moshfegh, Cassandra M; Watson, Gabrielle F; Case, Adam J",Brain behav. immun,,250
252035,"A Novel, Virtual, Multi-Institutional, Multi-Disciplinary Spine Education Program in Response to the COVID19 Pandemic",2020,"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, educational institutions quickly transitioned to remote learning. The problem of how to perform student assessment in an online environment has become increasingly relevant, leading many institutions and educators to turn to online proctoring services to administer remote exams. These services employ various student monitoring methods to curb cheating, including restricted (“lockdown”) browser modes, video/screen monitoring, local network traffic analysis, and eye tracking. In this paper, we explore the security and privacy perceptions of the student test-takers being proctored. We analyze user reviews of proctoring services' browser extensions and subsequently perform an online survey (n = 102). Our findings indicate that participants are concerned about both the amount and the personal nature of the information shared with the exam proctoring companies. However, many participants also recognize a trade-off between pandemic safety concerns and the arguably invasive means by which proctoring services ensure exam integrity. Our findings also suggest that institutional power dynamics and students' trust in their institutions may dissuade students' opposition to remote proctoring. © is held by the author/owner.

252232,"Retweeting for COVID-19: Consensus building, information sharing, dissent, and lockdown life",2020-04-06,"This paper aims to evoke an alternative viewpoint on surrogacy, moving beyond popular Western feminist beliefs on the practice, by introducing the history and current context of East Asian surrogacy. To elaborate a different cultural perspective on surrogacy, this paper first introduces the East Asian history of contract pregnancy systems, prior to the emergence of the American invention of 'modern' surrogacy practice. Then, it examines Japanese mass media portrayals of cross-border surrogacy in which white women have become 'convenient' entities. The results of the analysis show how Japanese culture has adopted a rhetoric about the use of white women as convenient surrogate mothers in the global commercial surrogacy market. An essential aspect of surrogacy is the premise that a woman's reproductive function should be accessible to others. Past discussions among feminists have neglected this important point. Moreover, they share the assumption that white surrogacy clients are exploiters, who take advantage of women of colour as surrogate mothers. The current situation in Asia flips this perspective-with white women regarded as easier targets for exploitation by wealthy people of colour. For Asian clients, Westerners can be easily regarded as 'others' whom they can use for their reproductive needs. In today's globalized era, the surrogacy industry is no longer for affluent Westerners only. Considering this change, it is crucial to discuss surrogacy issues by reconstructing feminist perspectives with a globalized view, to help protect women's bodies, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, skin colour, or religion.","Yanagihara, Yoshie",Bioethics,,250
252359,"COVID-19, Seignorage, Quantitative Easing and the Fiscal-Monetary Nexus",2021,"We present KDFNet, a novel method for 6D object pose estimation from RGB images. To handle occlusion, many recent works have proposed to localize 2D keypoints through pixel-wise voting and solve a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem for pose estimation, which achieves leading performance. However, such voting process is direction-based and cannot handle long and thin objects where the direction intersections cannot be robustly found. To address this problem, we propose a novel continuous representation called Keypoint Distance Field (KDF) for projected 2D keypoint locations. Formulated as a 2D array, each element of the KDF stores the 2D Euclidean distance between the corresponding image pixel and a specified projected 2D keypoint. We use a fully convolutional neural network to regress the KDF for each keypoint. Using this KDF encoding of projected object keypoint locations, we propose to use a distance-based voting scheme to localize the keypoints by calculating circle intersections in a RANSAC fashion. We validate the design choices of our framework by extensive ablation experiments. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Occlusion LINEMOD dataset with an average ADD(-S) accuracy of 50.3% and TOD dataset mug subset with an average ADD accuracy of 75.72%. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that the proposed method is able to robustly estimate the 6D pose in challenging scenarios including occlusion.","Liu, Xingyu; Iwase, Shun; Kitani, Kris M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10127v1.pdf,250

A few months later, this viral infection had spread worldwide and became a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, termed COVID-19, is multifactorial and associated with both specific antiviral as well as inflammatory responses, the extent of which may determine why some individuals are asymptomatic while others develop serious complications. Here we review possible life-threating immune events that can occur during disease progression to uncover key factors behind COVID-19 severity and provide suggestions for interventions with repurposed drugs in well-controlled and randomized clinical trials. These drugs include therapeutics with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells such as serine protease inhibitors of the cellular protease TMPS2 and drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system; antivirals with potential to block SARS-CoV-2 replication or factors that could boost the antiviral response; monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive the hyperinflammatory response during COVID-19 progression toward the severe stage and therapeutics that could ameliorate the function of the lungs. Furthermore, in order to help make more informed decisions on the timing of the intervention with the drugs listed in this review, we have grouped these therapeutics according to the stage of COVID-19 progression that we considered most appropriate for their mechanism of action.","Cardone, Marco; Yano, Masahide; Rosenberg, Amy S; Puig, Montserrat",Front Immunol,,250

They are not only highly transmissible (acquired through droplets), but Host reservoirs such as dromedary camels for MERS-CoV and masked palm civet for SARS-CoV-1 are critical links in the onset of outbreaks. Clinically they present with flu-like symptoms and therefore a high index of suspicion is required to ensure timely diagnosis and tailored management. Although there are not many reported series on these infections in pregnancy they seem to be associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and maternal mortality. Diagnosis is made by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. There are currently no effective anti-viral agents for these viruses but following infections various agents have been administered to patients. The most important aspect of management should be early identification of deterioration and intensive support and prevention of transmission. Our understanding of the evidence of the impact of both infections on pregnancies suggests the potential for future repeat outbreaks, hence the importance of maintaining vigilance across healthcare systems.","Babarinsa, Isaac A; Okunoye, Gbemisola O; Odukoya, Olusegun",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,250

Methods: We reviewed relevant literature to identify experts to interview. We carried out a thematic analysis of the literature and interview transcripts. We iteratively developed data coding on the many characteristics of violence against children, on the framing of the issue by proponents, and on the problem of governance - that is, how proponents organize themselves for collective action. Findings: The analysis of our data sources reveals many obstacles for global prioritization of addressing violence against children, including the forms of violence considered, inadequate data to describe prevalence and a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of proposed solutions. There exists fundamental disagreement among proponents on the recently introduced frame of violence against children, including differences in the types of violence that should be prioritized and in the proposed solutions (e.g. prevention or remediation). On governance, competition between networks focused on specific forms of violence is hampering efforts to create strong governing institutions. Conclusion: Despite the complex challenges identified, proponents have made some progress in global prioritization of addressing violence against children. To improve this prioritization further, proponents must resolve framing tensions and strengthen governance mechanisms to promote shared goals, while ensuring that networks focused on particular forms of violence are able to maintain their distinct identities.","Shawar, Yusra Ribhi; Shiffman, Jeremy",Bull World Health Organ,,250
256633,Identifying Factors in COVID-19 AI Case Predictions,2020,"Lithium is a mood stabiliser widely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of mania, bipolar disorders and recurrent depression. Treatment with lithium can give rise to various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including thyroid dysfunction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypercalcaemia. Lithium may induce hypercalcaemia through both acute and chronic effects. The initial acute effects are potentially reversible and occur as a result of lithium's action on the calcium-sensing receptor pathway and glycogen synthase kinase 3, giving rise to a biochemical picture similar to that seen in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. In the long term, chronic lithium therapy leads to permanent changes within the parathyroid glands by either unmasking hyperparathyroidism in patients with a subclinical parathyroid adenoma or possibly by initiating multiglandular hyperparathyroidism. The latter biochemical picture is identical to that of primary hyperparathyroidism. Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients on chronic lithium therapy, is associated with increased morbidity. Hence, regular monitoring of calcium levels in patients on lithium therapy is of paramount importance as early recognition of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism can improve outcomes. This review focuses on the definition, pathophysiology, presentation, investigations and management of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism.","Mifsud, Simon; Cilia, Kyle; Mifsud, Emma L; Gruppetta, Mark",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,250

OBJECTIVE: To examine a large number of patients' experiences, use of and attitudes towards telepsychiatry. METHODS: An anonymous 11-question survey was delivered electronically to 14,000 patients receiving telepsychiatry care at 18 participating centers across 11 US states between the months of April and June of 2020, including questions about their age and length of service use, as well as experience and satisfaction with telepsychiatry on a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and report data. RESULTS: 3,070 patients with different age ranges participated. The overall experience using telepsychiatry was either excellent or good for 82.2% using video, and 81.5% using telephone. 1,922 (63.6%) patients either agreed or strongly agreed that remote treatment sessions (telephone or video) have been just as helpful as in person treatment. Lack of commute (n=1,406, 46.1%) and flexible scheduling/rescheduling (n=1,389, 45.5%), were frequently reported advantages of telepsychiatry, whereas missing the clinic/hospital (n=936, 30.7%) and not feeling as connected to their doctor/nurse/therapist (n=752, 24.6%) were the most frequently reported challenges. After the current pandemic resolves, 1,937 (64.2%) respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that they would consider using remote treatment sessions in the future.

260676,Forecasting COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Using Empirical Data Analysis in Korea,2021,"The existence of widespread COVID-19 infections has prompted worldwide efforts to control and manage the virus, and hopefully curb it completely. One important line of research is the use of machine learning (ML) to understand and fight COVID-19. This is currently an active research field. Although there are already many surveys in the literature, there is a need to keep up with the rapidly growing number of publications on COVID-19-related applications of ML. This paper presents a review of recent reports on ML algorithms used in relation to COVID-19. We focus on the potential of ML for two main applications: diagnosis of COVID-19 and prediction of mortality risk and severity, using readily available clinical and laboratory data. Aspects related to algorithm types, training data sets, and feature selection are discussed. As we cover work published between January 2020 and January 2021, a few key points have come to light. The bulk of the machine learning algorithms used in these two applications are supervised learning algorithms. The established models are yet to be used in real-world implementations, and much of the associated research is experimental. The diagnostic and prognostic features discovered by ML models are consistent with results presented in the medical literature. A limitation of the existing applications is the use of imbalanced data sets that are prone to selection bias.","Alballa, Norah; Al-Turaiki, Isra",Inform Med Unlocked,,250

It aims also to examine the various factors that have led to the unequal distribution of the confirmed cases among the different MENA countries. METHODOLOGY: Data was retrieved from the World Health Organization situation reports issued between January 29 and June 5, 2020. It included the numbers of cumulative cases, new cases, and cumulative deaths reported by MENA countries. Similarly, we searched for relevant articles in PubMed and Medline. RESULTS: A total of 481,347 cases and 11,851 deaths occurred in the MENA region, accounting for 7.37% and 3.06% of the global cases and deaths respectively. Iran had the highest number of cases and deaths accounting for 34.1% and 68.1% of the MENA cases and deaths respectively. Together the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries accounted for 52.2% and 10.6% of MENA cases and deaths respectively. Egypt had the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths among the African countries of the region. Syria, Libya and Yemen (countries at war) had the lowest numbers of reported cases. The MENA region overall case fatality rate (CFR) was estimated at 2.46%. The highest CFR (22.75%) occurred in Yemen, and the lowest (0.07%) in Qatar.

260820,"Stay at home, engage at home: extended performance engagement in the time of COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary cystic kidney diseases such as nephronophthisis, polycystic kidney disease and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) are caused by a dysfunction of primary cilia. Cilia are involved in a variety of cellular functions and perceptions, with one of them being the sense of smell. Hyposmia is a typical feature found in patients with BBS. However, reports of olfactory dysfunction in other cystic kidney diseases are sparse. Here we provide a systematic survey on olfaction in a large cohort of patients displaying genetically determined renal ciliopathies. METHODS: We performed a match-controlled systematic olfactory evaluation in a group of 75 patients with a defined genetic background using age adapted and validated odour identification tests. RESULTS: Test results revealed a significant olfactory deficit in patients carrying TMEM67 variants (n=4), while all other genetic disorders causing nephronophthisis (n=25) or polycystic kidney disease (n=18) were not associated with an impaired sense of smell. Also in patients with BBS, olfactory performance was depending on the underlying molecular defect. While defects in the BBS1 gene (n=9) had no impact on the sense of smell, all other BBS gene disorders (n=19) were associated with significant hyposmia. Noteworthy, there was no correlation of the olfactory deficit with the level of renal impairment. CONCLUSION: Hyposmia is a part of the clinical spectrum of BBS and of other renal ciliopathies. Depending on the genetic background, clinicians should be aware of this subtle and so far underappreciated symptom when clinically assessing patients with BBS or TMEM67 gene variants.","Dahmer-Heath, Mareike; Schriever, Valentin; Kollmann, Sabine; Schleithoff, Carolin; Titieni, Andrea; Cetiner, Metin; Patzer, Ludwig; Tönshoff, Burkhard; Hansen, Matthias; Pennekamp, Petra; Gerß, Joachim; Konrad, Martin; König, Jens",J. medical. genet,,250

Medical practitioners find data quality management practices intrusive to their operations. Using Health Management Information System (HMIS) that uses DHIS2 platform, our qualitative case study establishes that isomorphism leads to legitimization of data quality management practices among health practitioners and subsequently data quality. This case study employed the methods of observation, semi structured interviews and review of artefacts to explore how through isomorphic processes data quality management practices are legitimized among the stakeholders. Data was collected from Ministry of Health's (Malawi) HMIS Technical Working Group members in Lilongwe and from medical practitioners and data clerks in Thyolo district. From the findings we noted that mimetic isomorphism led to moral and pragmatic legitimacy while and normative isomorphism led to cognitive legitimacy within the HMIS structure and helped to attain correctness and timeliness of the data and reports respectively. Through this understanding we firstly contribute to literature on organizational issues in IS research. Secondly, we contribute to practice as we motivate health service managers to capitalize on isomorphic forces to help legitimization of data quality management practices among health practitioners.","Msendma, Martin Bright; Chigona, Wallace; Kumwenda, Benjamin; Kaasboll, Jens; Kanjo, Chipo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09942v1.pdf,250

Fine particles are, in fact, those most capable of penetrating in depth into the respiratory system. People spend most of their time indoors where concentrations of some pollutants are sometimes higher than outdoors. Therefore, there is the need to ensure a healthy indoor environment and for this purpose the use of an air purifier can be a valuable aid especially now since it was demonstrated that indoor air quality has a high impact on spreading of viral infections such as that due to SARS-COVID19. In this study, we tested a commercial system that can be used as an air purifier. In particular it was verified its efficiency in reducing concentrations of PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 µm), PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm), PM1 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 1 µm), and particles number in the range 0.3 µm-10 µm. Furthermore, its capacity in reducing VOCs concentration was also checked. PM measurements were carried out by means of a portable optical particle counter (OPC) instrument simulating the working conditions typical of a household environment. In particular we showed that the tested air purifier significantly reduced both PM10 and PM2.5 by 16.8 and 7.25 times respectively that corresponds to a reduction of about 90% and 80%. A clear reduction of VOCs concentrations was also observed since a decrease of over 50% of these gaseous substances was achieved.","Fermo, Paola; Artíñano, Begoña; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Pantaleo, Antonio Marco; Parente, Alessandro; Battaglia, Fiorella; Colicino, Elena; Di Tanna, Gianluca; Goncalves da Silva Junior, Andouglas; Pereira, Igor Gadelha; Garcia, Gabriel Santos; Garcia Goncalves, Luiz Marcos; Comite, Valeria; Miani, Alessandro",Environ Res,,250

We determined the prospective association of brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) with incident AF among older adults. Methods: We included 2027 Cardiovascular Health Study participants (mean age=78.3 years, male=39%, Black=17%) who underwent brachial FMD measurement at the 1997 to 1998 clinic visit. Incident AF was ascertained by study electrocardiograms, hospital discharge diagnosis coding and Medicare claims data. Cox regression models were used to examine the association between FMD and incident AF. Results: We identified 754 incident of AF cases (37%) over a median follow-up of 11.0 years. After adjusting for age, sex, race, height, weight, cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, kidney function, c-reactive protein, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and statins, the risk of AF did not differ according to brachial FMD response (4th vs 1st quartile hazard ratio (HR)=1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.26; per FMD unit increment HR=1.01, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.05). Conclusion: We found no relationship between brachial FMD and the risk of developing AF in this elderly cohort. Our findings suggest that the utility of brachial FMD as a risk marker for AF in older individuals is minimal.","Garg, Parveen K; Bartz, Traci M; Burke, Gregory; Gottdiener, John S; Herrington, David; Heckbert, Susan R; Kizer, Jorge R; Sotoodehnia, Nona; Mukamal, Kenneth J",Vasc Health Risk Manag,,250

We recognize that many decisions are made based on the practical limitations that transplant programs face, especially at the extremes. As programs make the transition from a standard approach to a resource-constrained approach to transplantation, we utilize a framework for ethical decisions in settings of absolutely scarce resources to help guide programs in deciding which patients to transplant, which donors to accept, how to minimize risk, and how to ensure the best utilization of transplant team members.","Wall, Anji E; Pruett, Timothy; Stock, Peter; Testa, Giuliano",Am J Transplant,,250

Participants completed a newly developed COVID-19 Fear (Higher Education) scale to measure three domains of fear including fear of infection, fear of instability and fear of insecurity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. They also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) on the severity of anxiety symptoms. About 9.6% of the participants could be classified as exhibiting high anxiety level according to the GAD-7. More students studying overseas (about 15%) were classified into the high GAD group when compared to students studying in both mainland China (6.6%) and Hong Kong (6.1%). MANOVA results showed that students studying in Hong Kong and overseas had more concerns related to preventive measures related to COVID-19 than their mainland counterparts did. We concluded that international students studying away from their home country would have higher risk to develop anxiety problems during a collective trauma such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Education institutions should provide support services including online support groups, social media groups for mutual support to alleviate the fear and anxiety of international students.","Feng, Shiyin; Zhang, Qiaochu; Ho, Samuel M Y",Heal. soc. care community,,250

Clinical indexes of patients upon admission/discharge were examined. Patients were divided into two groups according to different treatment plans (danoprevir and lopinavir/ritonavir). The days to achieve negative nucleic acid testing and the days of hospital stays were counted and statistically analyzed. COVID-19 patients treated with danoprevir or lopinavir/ritonavir were all improved and discharged. Indexes like blood routine, inflammation and immune-related indexes were significantly recovered after treatment. Additionally, under the circumstance that there was no significant difference in patients' general information between the two groups, we found that the mean time to achieve both negative nucleic acid testing and hospital stays of patients treated with danoprevir were significantly shorter than those of patients with lopinavir/ritonavir. Collectively, applying danoprevir is a good treatment plan for COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Zhicheng; Wang, Shumei; Tu, Xianglin; Peng, Xuping; Huang, Yanxia; Wang, Li; Ju, Weihua; Rao, Jianfeng; Li, Xue; Zhu, Donghong; Sun, Huabao; Chen, Hongyi",J. med. virol,,250

In Maryland and Washington, DC, United States, more than 2500 cases were reported within 3 weeks of the first COVID-19 detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - in the region. We analyzed 620 samples collected from the Johns Hopkins Health System during March 11-31, 2020, comprising 28.6% of the total cases in Maryland and Washington, DC. From these samples, we generated 114 complete viral genomes. Analysis of these genomes alongside a subsampling of over 1000 previously published sequences showed that the diversity in this region rivaled global SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity at that time and that the sequences belong to all of the major globally circulating lineages, suggesting multiple introductions into the region. We also analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and found that clinically severe cases had viral genomes belonging to all major viral lineages. We conclude that efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and the interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","Thielen, Peter M; Wohl, Shirlee; Mehoke, Thomas; Ramakrishnan, Srividya; Kirsche, Melanie; Falade-Nwulia, Oluwaseun; Trovão, Nídia S; Ernlund, Amanda; Howser, Craig; Sadowski, Norah; Morris, C Paul; Hopkins, Mark; Schwartz, Matthew; Fan, Yunfan; Gniazdowski, Victoria; Lessler, Justin; Sauer, Lauren; Schatz, Michael C; Evans, Jared D; Ray, Stuart C; Timp, Winston; Mostafa, Heba H",JCI insight,,250

An e-guide was designed to provide remote support to the general public through the application of a Behavioural Activation approach. Interactive, brief evidence-based exercises were included in the e-guide, along with mood ratings after each exercise to assess any improvements observed.MethodThe e-guide was designed using the Xerte On- Line Toolkits open source software. Videos and interactive exercises were embedded within the resource, forming part of the brief intervention based on cognitivist and behaviourist principles. Information and further support was also provided for young people and parents. Videos from the public highlighting their experiences during the pandemic were also sourced and included (with consent). A pilot was launched to assess the impact of the e-guide. Participants were recruited from Cardiff University, mental health services and a local charity.ResultThe e-guide was piloted on a sample of volunteers (n = 3), who completed a brief survey after engaging with the resource. Following the results of the pilot, the e-guide was promoted by the university's marketing team and made available to the public. At the 6-month mark, the e-guide had been accessed by 3228 individuals throughout the UK.ConclusionThe e-guide has since been disseminated by support services for young people, places of employment and eduction institutions. The national impact of the e-guide is evidenced from the number of people accessing the resource exceeding 3000.

269080,Virtual Residency Interviews: Optimization for Applicants,2020,"Introduction Use of high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia has been greatly debated around the world due to concern for increased healthcare worker transmission and delays in invasive mechanical Ventilation (IMV). Herein we analyze the utility of the ROX index to predict the need and timing for IMV in a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with HFNT. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of 129 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to May 17, 2020 with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). HFNT patients were divided into two groups: HFNT only and HFNT progressed to IMV. The primary outcome was the ability of the ROX index to predict the need of IMV. Secondary outcomes were mortality, rates of intubation, length of stay (LOS) and rates of nosocomial infections in our cohort treated with HFNT were also reported. Results 837 patients with COVID-19 were screened, 129 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.8(+13.6) years, BMI 32.6(+8), 58(45 %) were female, 72(55.8%) were African American, 40 (31%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2%) were smokers. Of the 129, 89 were HFNT only group whereas 40 in the HFNT progressed to IMV group. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days(+ 3.3). The 89 HFNT only patients had a significant improvement in ROX from initiation of HFNT at all recorded time points. In contrast, the ROX in HFNT progressed to IMV patients remained unchanged or decreased over time. ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p &lt;0.0001). In multivariate analysis, ΔROX (&lt;=0 versus &gt;0), peak D-dimer &gt;4000 and admission GFR &lt; 60 ml/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=0.001). Mortality was 11.2% in HFNT only group versus 47.5% in the HFNT progressed to IMV group (p = 0.0001). Mortality and need for pulmonary vasodilators were higher in the HNFT progressed to IMV group. Conclusion ROX index is a valuable, noninvasive tool to evaluate patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 treated with HFNT. ROX helps predicts need for IMV and thus limiting morbidity and mortality associated with IMV.","Patel, M.; Chowdhury, J. M.; Mills, N.; Marron, R. M.; Gangemi, A. J.; Dorey-Stein, Z.

269504,Bin it or pin it? Which professional ethical guidance on managing COVID-19 should I follow?,2020,"With the increase of COVID-19 cases worldwide, an effective way is required to diagnose COVID-19 patients. The primary problem in diagnosing COVID-19 patients is the shortage of testing kits, due to the quick spread of the virus, medical practitioners are facing difficulty identifying the positive cases. The second real-world problem is to share the data among the hospitals globally while keeping in view the privacy concern of the organizations. To address the problem of building a collaborative network model without leakage privacy of data are major concerns for training the deep learning model, this paper proposes a framework that collects a huge amount of data from different sources (various hospitals) and to train the deep learning model over a decentralized network for the newest information about COVID-19 patients. The main goal of this paper is to improve the recognition of a global deep learning model using, novel and up-to-date data, and learn itself from such data to improve recognition of COVID-19 patients based on computed tomography (CT) slices. Moreover, the integration of blockchain and federated-learning technology collects the data from different hospitals without leakage the privacy of the data. Firstly, we collect real-life COVID-19 patients data open to the research community. Secondly, we use various deep learning models (VGG, DenseNet, AlexNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and Capsule Network) to recognize the patterns via COVID-19 patients' lung screening. Thirdly, securely share the data among various hospitals with the integration of federated learning and blockchain. Finally, our results demonstrate a better performance to detect COVID-19 patients.","Kumar, Rajesh; Khan, Abdullah Aman; Zhang, Sinmin; Wang, WenYong; Abuidris, Yousif; Amin, Waqas; Kumar, Jay",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06537v1.pdf,250
269777,Alleviating An Unequal COVID-19 World: Globally Digital and Productively Healthy,2020,"Infection with SARS-COV-2 leads to a number of pathologies in the hematopoetic system that have significant impact on clinical symptoms and mortality. There are 3 stages of infection: (1) early upper respiratory tract infection with fever and lymphopenia (2) pulmonary phase and (3) hyperinflammatory phase with the clinical signs of organ failure such as ARDS/shock. Hyperinflammation, which is triggered by activation of T cells and monocytes/macrophages, is essential for organ pathologies. Interferon IFN-É£, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, IL-10 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play important roles as mediators of inflammation. In analogy to the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after CAR-T cell therapy, the therapeutic activity of the IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab is investigated in clinical studies.The coagulation system is activated during the inflammatory phase of COVID infection, most likely on the pathophysiological basis of immune thrombosis. Clinically, there is a significantly increased incidence of venous (especially pulmonary artery embolism), but also arterial thromboembolism (TE). In laboratory chemistry, the D-dimer, fibrinogen but also vWF and FVIII are significantly increased. Guidelines for the prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-associated coagulopathy have been developed. Analogous to other viral infections, there are approaches to passive immunization using convalescent plasma. Its administration has shown promising activity in first uncontrolled case series and is currently being examined in clinical studies worldwide for its therapeutic activity.","Spiekermann, Karsten; Subklewe, Marion; Hildebrandt, Martin; Humpe, Andreas; von Bergwelt-Baildon, Michael",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,250

METHODS: Methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) (PAX5, EDNRB, and DCC) were measured in the oral rinses from 50 HNSCC and 58 control subjects using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Diagnostic accuracies in detecting HNSCC and the detection rate of recurrence in the post-treatment monitoring were analyzed. RESULTS: ddPCR TSG methylation detection in oral rinses for diagnosis of HNSCC had an AUC of 0.892 for PAX5, 0.753 for EDNRB, and 0.729 for DCC. Significant drop of TSG methylation was observed after completion of surgery (p < 0.01). 76.9% of the relapse cases had a pre-emptive rebound of methylation above presurgery levels in at least one of the tested markers before confirmed recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing ddPCR for TSG methylation detection in oral rinses shows potential for detection and monitoring of HNSCC.","Fung, Sherwood Y H; Chan, Kwan Chee Allen; Wong, Eddy W Y; Ng, Cherrie W K; Cho, Ryan; Yeung, Zenon W C; Lam, Jacky W K; Chan, Jason Y K",Head neck,,250

Personal protective equipment can also cause irritation to the skin and mucous membrane. It is concluded from the study that skin must be protected from the exposure of the external environment where the virus may be present. Moreover, sanitizers and soaps must be used in a limited quantity and proper medication should be taken by the patients having a skin disease because they may get affected with the coronavirus.","Sharma, Akanksha; Malviya, Rishabha",Open Dermatol.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and the COVID-19 cases at the community-level and to assess how SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations should be integrated into a wastewater-based epidemiological statistical model that can provide reliable forecasts for the number of COVID-19 infections and the evolution over time as well. Weekly variations on the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and COVID-19 cases from April 29, 2020 through February 17, 2021 were obtained in Borough of Indiana, PA. Vector autoregression (VAR) model with different data forms were fitted on this data from April 29, 2020 through January 27, 2021, and the performance in three weeks ahead forecasting (February 3, 10, and 17) were compared with measures of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). A stationary block bootstrapping VAR method was also presented to reduce the variability in the forecasting values. Our results demonstrate that VAR(1) estimated with the logged data has the best interpretation of the data, but a VAR(1) estimated with the original data has a stronger forecasting ability. The forecast accuracy, measured by MAPE, for 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks in the future can be as low as 11.85%, 8.97% and 21.57%. The forecasting performance of the model on a short time span is unfortunately not very impressive. Also, a single increase in the SARS-CoV-2 concentration can impact the COVID-19 cases in an inverted-U shape pattern with the maximum impact occur in the third week after. The flexibility of this approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different locations where the wastewater surveillance system has been implemented.","Cao, Yongtao; Francis, Roland",Sci Total Environ,,250
273947,The mixed reality medical ward round with the MS HoloLens 2: Innovation in reducing COVID-19 transmission and PPE usage,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may trigger severe pneumonia in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients through release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and recruitment of neutrophils in the lungs. Activated neutrophils induce inflammation and severe alveolar injury by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The backbones of many DAMPs and NETs are made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such as elastase, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histones. Dornase alfa is a FDA-approved recombinant human DNAse 1 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways and reducing NETs-induced toxicity on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs. TRIAL DESIGN: COVIDornase is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multicentric, open-label clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will recruit mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the recruiting centres (at the time of writing: The Rothschild foundation hospital in Paris, the Strasbourg university hospitals, and Metz-Thionville hospital) who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Adult patient (age &#8805; 18 years old); - Hospitalized in ICU; - With severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS according to Berlin criteria (PaO2/FiO2 < 300 and PEEP > 5 cmH2O); - Intubated for less than 8 days; - With an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation > 48 hours; - Carrier of an arterial catheter; - For whom 4 PaO2/FiO2 values over the preceding 24 hours are available; NON-INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Known hypersensitivity to dornase alfa or any of its excipients; - Pregnant or breastfeeding status; - Patient under legal protection. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention 1, Study group Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme®, Roche, Switzerland) will be administered by aerosol, at a dose of 2500 IU twice daily, 12 hours apart, for 7 consecutive days, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo®, Aerogen, Ireland). The remainder of the management will be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, including mechanical ventilation (protective ventilation, PEEP > 5 cmH2O, tracheal balloon pressure check every 4 hours or automatic device, 30° head of the bed elevation, tidal volume 6-8mL/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O), neuromuscular blockers if necessary, prone position if PaO2/FiO2 < 150, early enteral nutrition, glycemic control and a sedation protocol based on the RASS score. Intervention 2, Comparator Patients will receive usual care in accordance with good practice (as detailed above), without aerosols. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one grade improvement between D0 (inclusion) and D7 in the ARDS scale severity (Berlin criteria). For instance from ""severe"" to ""moderate"" or from ""moderate"" to ""mild"". RANDOMISATION: All consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised 1:1 using an eCRF-based, computer-generated randomisation table, either to the dornase alfa arm or to the control arm. An interim analysis will be performed after inclusion of 20 patients. Inclusions may be stopped at the interim analysis per data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) advice, if statistical analyses conclude on the futility or efficacy of the intervention or by other DSMB decision. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and caregivers will not be blinded to study group assignment. Those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Fifty patients will be randomized to each group, 100 patients in total. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version number 2, April 29th, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing.

We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase to identify publications that reported one or more patients with COVID-19 who had a seizure and had CSF testing preformed. The search ranged from December 1st 2019 to November 18th 2020. We identified 56 publications which described 69 unique patients who met our inclusion criteria. Of the 54 patients whose past medical history was provided, 2 (4%) had epilepsy and 1 (2%) had a prior seizure in the setting of hyperglycemia, but the remaining 51 (94%) had no history of seizures. Seizure was the initial symptom of COVID-19 for 15 (22%) patients. There were 26 (40%) patients who developed status epilepticus. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was performed in the CSF for 45 patients; 6 (13%) had a positive CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR, only 1 (17%) of whom had status epilepticus. The cycle thresholds were not reported. Evaluation for CSF SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (directly or indirectly, via testing for CSF oligoclonal bands or immunoglobulins) was performed in 26 patients, only 2 (8%) of whom had evidence of intrathecal antibody synthesis. Of the 11 patients who had CSF autoimmune antibody panels tested, 1 had NMDA antibodies and 1 had Caspr-2 antibodies. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF of patients with seizures who have COVID-19 is uncommon. Our review suggests that seizures in this patient population are not likely due to direct viral invasion of the brain.","Carroll, Elizabeth; Melmed, Kara R; Frontera, Jennifer; Placantonakis, Dimitris G; Galetta, Steven; Balcer, Laura; Lewis, Ariane",Seizure,,250

Data reported for 109,129 women served by 132 unique promoters and 192 unique public health facilities is analyzed using logistic regression, interrupted time series analysis and hazard analysis. The results demonstrate that the imposition of the state of emergency is associated with a modest short-term drop in both service provision and utilization, followed by a relatively rapid rebound. We conclude that in this context, the accessibility of reproductive health services was not dramatically reduced during the first phase of the pandemic-related emergency.","Leight, Jessica; Hensly, Catherine; Chissano, Marcos; Ali, Liza",PLoS One,,250

275129,"2020 Hurricane Season FAQ: Federal Disaster Assistance for Hurricanes During the COVID-19 Pandemic [June 1, 2020]",2020,"OBJECTIVE: It is known that social isolation process has an impact on individuals' eating behaviours. Continuing nutritional behaviour resulting from emotional eating, uncontrolled eating and cognitive restriction may turn into eating disorders in the future. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible effects of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social isolation process on individuals' nutritional behaviours and body weight changes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Nutritional behaviours of the participants before the COVID-19 pandemic and in the social isolation process were evaluated with the Three Factor Nutrition Questionnaire. The changes in individuals' body weight during this period were also evaluated. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1036 volunteer individuals (827 women, 209 men) aged 18 years and over participated in the study. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation process, there was an increase in emotional eating and uncontrolled eating behaviours of individuals, but no significant change in cognitive restriction behaviour occurred (P = <0·00; P = <0·00 and P = 0·53, respectively). It was reported that the body weight of 35 % of the individuals who participated in the study increased during this period. CONCLUSION: Social isolation process practiced as a result of COVID-19 pandemic may lead to changes in some nutritional behaviours. Some precautions should be taken to prevent this situation that occurs in nutritional behaviours from causing negative health problems in the future.","Elmacioglu, Funda; Emiroglu, Elif; Ülker, Mutlu Tuçe; Özyilmaz Kircali, Berkin; Oruç, Sena",Public Health Nutr,,250

Growing reports argue about the potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but with inconsistent results.This study aimed to assess the potential benefits of HCQ on viral conversion, reducing the need for ICU or mechanical ventilation, and its impact on mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted enrolling confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients. They were subjected to plain CXR (HRCT of chest if needed), routine laboratory tests for COVID-19 (including CBC, CRP, LDH, D-Dimer, ferritin, and blood sugar), ECG, and blood gases. They were allocated to either HCQ or non-HCQ groups. Both groups were followed-up for symptoms resolution, need for ICU admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, duration till conversion, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 202 patients with moderate COVID-19 were enrolled with a mean age of 55.05±10.15, out of whom 80% were male patients. The most common presenting symptom was fever (87.38% in the control group versus 92% in the HCQ group), followed by cough (82.52% versus 89.9%). In total, 24.27% of patients in the control group versus 28.3% in the HCQ group deteriorated and necessitated ICU admission (p=0.52), 13.6% of the control group versus 19.2% in the HCQ group required mechanical ventilation (p=0.28), and 69.9% of the control group versus 68.9% in the HCQ group converted negative on day 7 (p=0.85). No significant mortality difference between both groups was observed (4.9% versus 6.1%, p=0.47). CONCLUSION: This work did not support any benefits of using HCQ in patients with COVID-19, neither in reducing the need for ICU, mechanical ventilation, nor mortality.","Lotfy, Samah Mohamad; Abbas, Ahmad; Shouman, Waheed",Turk Thorac J,,250

Commercially available serologic tests for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are being performed. The concept of an 'immunity passport' has gained popularity, whereby evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production would signal immunity to reinfection. For an immunity certificate to be validated for travel purposes, it should meet certain criteria. The introduction of such certificates faces multiple challenges. While there may be a future role for immunity passports in limited circumstances in the event that a protective vaccine becomes freely available, for now at least the risks of such an approach outweigh the perceived benefits.","Liew, Chee H; Flaherty, Gerard T",J. public health (Oxf),,250

Articles in English language were reviewed.Results:We tried to apply the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle in triaging and management of patients for radiotherapy. We identified protocols which have hypofractionated regimens (reducing patient visits to hospital, time spent in treatment console) with similar outcomes when compared to conventional fractionated regimens and not overburdening the healthcare facility. We also identified the tumours for which we could safely avoid or delay the initiation of radiotherapy.Conclusion:Treatment decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic rely on the safety first/do no harm principle and evidence-based prioritisation of cases for triage. This article is a tool to aid in triaging and prioritising brain tumour patient management.

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, a trained research team observed the dispensary teams of 12 community pharmacies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 6 of which were operating virtual pharmacy care. A standardized data collection form was used to include information about dispensing of OTC medicines and pharmacist interventions on those with abuse/misuse potential. The clinical significance of the interventions was evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee. RESULTS: The frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with abuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 83.2% versus 91.0%, respectively, whereas the frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with misuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 79.8% versus 41.2%, respectively. The proportions of clinically significant interventions across pharmacies with and without virtual services were 19.7% versus 10.5%, respectively. Cough medicines were dispensed significantly more across pharmacies with virtual care than across pharmacies without virtual care (25.6% vs. 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.04). Asking the patient to seek the advice of an addiction specialist (adjusted odds ratio = 4.11; P = 0.001) versus refusing to sell the drug was more likely to be associated with pharmacies with virtual services than with pharmacies operating traditional pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Virtual pharmaceutical care is a potential approach to reduce the abuse/misuse of OTC medicines but needs some improvements regarding detection of these cases. The UAE is the first country in the region to implement and regulate virtual pharmacy practice.","Al Mazrouei, Nadia; Ibrahim, Rana M; Al Meslamani, Ahmad Z; Abdel-Qader, Derar H; Mohamed Ibrahim, Osama",,,250

We aimed to study the course of pertussis in France over an 8-year period and its association with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, using multiple nationwide data sources. MethodsWe analyzed the number of French pertussis cases between 2013 and 2020, using the PCR test results from nationwide outpatient laboratories (Source 1) and the pediatric network of 41 hospitals (Source 2), and using the reports of an office-based pediatric national network (Source 3). We conducted a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis, relying on negative binomial regression models. The models accounted for seasonality, long-term cycles, and secular trend, and included a binary variable for the first national lockdown (ordered on March 16, 2021). ResultsWe identified 19,039 cases of pertussis from the three data sources during the study period. There was a significant decrease of pertussis cases following the implementation of mitigation measures, with adjusted incidence rate ratios of 0.102 (95% CI 0.040-0.256) and 0.216 (95% CI 0.071-0.656) for Source 1 and Source 2, respectively. The association was confirmed in Source 3 (median of 1 [IQR 0-2] vs. 0 [IQR 0-0] pertussis cases per month before and after lockdown, respectively, p=0.0048). ConclusionThe drastic reduction of outpatient and hospitalized cases of pertussis strongly suggests an impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures and their consequences on pertussis epidemiology. Pertussis vaccination recommendations should be carefully followed, and disease monitoring should be continued to detect any resurgence after relaxation of mitigation measures.

Who should access data? What is a legitimate role for ""Big Tech"" companies in the development and implementation of these systems? How should cultural and behavioural issues be accounted for in the design of these apps? Should use of these apps be compulsory? What does transparency and ethical oversight mean in this context? We demonstrate that responses to these questions are complex and contingent and argue that if digital contract-tracing is used, then it should be clear that this is on a trial basis and its use should be subject to independent monitoring and evaluation.","Lucivero, Federica; Hallowell, Nina; Johnson, Stephanie; Prainsack, Barbara; Samuel, Gabrielle; Sharon, Tamar",J. bioeth. inq,,250

279969,Combating climate change in a post-COVID-19 era,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define whether rapidly reallocating health care workers not experienced with PP for performing PP in ICU is feasible and safe. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In the setting of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the use of prone and supine positioning procedures (PP) has been associated with improved oxygenation resulting in decreased mortality. Nevertheless, applying PP is time consuming for ICU staffs that are at risk of mental of physical exhaustion, especially with the constant surge of admitted COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. METHODS: This prospective cohort study conducted at a single regional university hospital between March 27 and April 15, 2020. Among 117 patients admitted to ICU, 67 patients (57.3%) presented with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe ARDS requiring PP. After accelerated simulation training, 109 volunteers including surgeons, physicians, nurses and physiotherapists, multiple dedicated teams performed daily multiple PP following a systematic checklist. Patient demographics and PP data were collected. Patient safety and health care workers safety were assessed. RESULTS: Among 117 patients admitted to ICU, 67 patients (57.3%) required PP. Overall, 53 (79%) were male, with a median age of 68.5 years and median body mass index of 29.3âkg/m. A total of 384 PP were performed. Overall, complication occurred in 34 PP (8.8%) and led to PP cancelation in 4 patients (1%). Regarding health care workers safety, four health care workers presented with potential COVID-19 related symptoms and none was positive. CONCLUSIONS: To overcome the surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients, reallocating health care workers to targeted medical tasks beyond their respective expertise such as PP was safe.","Doussot, Alexandre; Ciceron, Floriane; Cerutti, Emilie; Salomon du Mont, Lucie; Thines, Laurent; Capellier, Gilles; Pretalli, Jean-Baptiste; Evrard, Philippe; Vettoretti, Lucie; Garbuio, Patrick; Brunel, Anne-Sophie; Pili-Floury, Sebastien; Lakkis, Zaher",Ann Surg,,250

We thereby develop locally adaptive smoothing methods for both functional time series and spatial data by extending trend filtering, a powerful nonparametric trend estimation technique for scalar data. We formulate the functional version of trend filtering by introducing $L_2$-norm of the differences of adjacent trend functions. Through orthonormal basis expansion, we simplify the objective function to squared loss for coefficient vectors with grouped fused lasso penalty, and develop an efficient iteration algorithm for optimization. The tuning parameter in the proposed method is selected via cross validation. We also consider an extension of the proposed algorithm to spatial functional data. The proposed methods are demonstrated by simulation studies and an application to two real world datasets.","Wakayama, Tomoya; Sugasawa, Shonosuke",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02456v2.pdf,250
281859,The state of the nursing profession in the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife 2020 during COVID-19: A Nursing Standpoint,2020,"Rising the female labour force participation has been one of the most remarkable economic developments of the last century. Yet the employment rates of women are lower than those for men and women's global labour force participation rate is 26.5 percentage points below that of men. Among factors that trigger female underrepresentation in the labour market it is the motherhood considered as the most significant one. The workplaces have been built around the men's traditional life patterns and it inevitably leads to widespread attrition among women that have children or provide care of other family members. Therefore, measures aimed at facilitating the balance between work and family obligations should be developed. Some of them have been introduced into a relatively recent EU Directive 2019/ 1158 of June 2019 on work life balance that is to be implemented by the EU Member States until June 2022. The WLB directive provides five such work-life balance measures-a paternity leave, a parental leave, a carers' leave, a time off from work on grounds of force majeure and the flexible working arrangements. WLB measures have a great potential to facilitate the work of women and diminish their vulnerability in the labour market, what has been particularly visible during the COVID-19 pandemic containment. However, the effective implementation of WLB directive requires the enterprises' favourable attitude and protection against the discrimination. At the same time, WLB measures are just a part of a multidimensional system required to enable the full enjoyment of two EU fundamental right-the right to work and the right to gender equality. © Peter Lang GmbH.

282345,Modeling in the Time of COVID-19: Statistical and Rule-based Mesoscale Models,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reducing COVID-19 transmission relies on controlling droplet and aerosol spread. Fluorescein staining reveals microscopic droplets. AIM: To compare the droplet spread in non-laminar and laminar air flow operating theatres. METHODS: A 'cough-generator' was fixed to a theatre trolley at 45°. Fluorescein-stained 'secretions' were projected on to a series of calibrated targets. These were photographed under UV light and 'source detection' software measured droplet splatter size and distance. FINDINGS: The smallest droplet detected was â¼120 µm and the largest â¼24,000 µm. An average of 25,862 spots was detected in the non-laminar theatre, compared with 11,430 in the laminar theatre (56% reduction). The laminar air flow mainly affected the smaller droplets (<1000 µm). The surface area covered with droplets was: 6% at 50 cm, 1% at 2 m, and 0.5% at 3 m in the non-laminar air flow; and 3%, 0.5%, and 0.2% in the laminar air flow, respectively. CONCLUSION: Accurate mapping of droplet spread in clinical environments is possible using fluorescein staining and image analysis. The laminar air flow affected the smaller droplets but had limited effect on larger droplets in our 'aerosol-generating procedure' cough model. Our results indicate that the laminar air flow theatre requires similar post-surgery cleaning to the non-laminar, and staff should consider full personal protective equipment for medium- and high-risk patients.","Newsom, R B; Amara, A; Hicks, A; Quint, M; Pattison, C; Bzdek, B R; Burridge, J; Krawczyk, C; Dinsmore, J; Conway, J",J Hosp Infect,,250

282764,Evaluating the influence of energy prices on tight oil supply with implications on the impacts of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Nutrition therapy is essential in critically ill adults. Little is known about appropriate nutrition therapy in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection receiving mechanical ventilation. Data regarding patient demographics and nutrition therapy were collected. Patients that received enteral nutrition within 24 hours of starting mechanical ventilation were compared with patients starting enteral nutrition later. The primary outcome was inpatient length of stay. Propensity score matching was conducted to control for baseline differences in patient groups. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients were included in final analysis. Patients who received enteral nutrition within 24 hours received a significantly greater daily amount of calories (17.5 vs 15.2 kcal/kg, P = .015) and protein (1.04 vs 0.85 g/kg, P = .003). There was no difference in length of stay (18.5 vs 23.5 days, P = .37). The propensity score analysis included 100 patients. Following propensity scoring, significant differences in daily calorie (17.7 [4.6] vs 15.1 [5.1] kcal/kg/d, P = .009) and protein (1.03 [0.35] vs 0.86 [0.38] g/kg/d, P = .014) provision remained. No differences in length of stay or other outcomes were noted in the propensity score analysis. CONCLUSION: Initiation of enteral nutrition within 24 hours was not associated with improved outcomes in mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19. No harm was detected either. Future research should seek to clarify optimal timing of enteral nutrition initiation in patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation.","Farina, Nicholas; Nordbeck, Sarah; Montgomery, Michelle; Cordwin, Laura; Blair, Faith; Cherry-Bukowiec, Jill; Kraft, Michael D; Pleva, Melissa R; Raymond, Erica",Nutr Clin Pract,,250

Eng. 36 (2021) 24–37],2021,"Acute systemic diseases, such as severe infections, can lead to electrolyte and acid-base alterations. To study the presence of electrolyte imbalance in severe COVID-19, we investigated the frequency and consequences of changes in electrolyte and acid-base patterns over time. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 406 patients with severe COVID-19. Levels of electrolytes, base excess, pH, serum osmolality and hematocrit, the first two weeks of hospitalization, were collected daily from the laboratory database and clinical data from patients' medical records. We found that hyponatremia was present in 57% of the patients at admission and hypernatremia in 2%. However, within two weeks of hospitalization 42% of the patients developed hypernatremia, more frequently in critically ill patients. Lower levels of sodium and potassium at admission was associated with need of mechanical ventilation. Decreased pH at admission was associated with both death and need of mechanical ventilation. Hypernatremia in the ICU was combined with rising base excess and a higher pH. In the group without intensive care, potassium levels was significantly lower in the patients with severe hypernatremia. Presence of hypernatremia during the first two weeks of hospitalization was associated with 3.942 (95% CI 2.269-6.851) times higher odds of death. In summary, hypernatremia was common and associated with longer hospital stay and a higher risk of death, suggesting that the dynamics of sodium is an important indicator of severity in COVID-19.","Sjöström, Anna; Rysz, Susanne; Sjöström, Henrik; Höybye, Charlotte",,,250

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey design study used an open and closed-ended questionnaire to assess the impact of the Webinar on deep learning of topical areas within the management of the post-operative tetralogy of Fallot patients. This was a quantitative research methodology using descriptive statistical analyses with a sequential explanatory design. RESULTS: One thousand-three-hundred and seventy-four participants from 100 countries on 6 continents joined the Webinar, 557 (40%) of whom completed the questionnaire. Over 70% of participants reported that they ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that the Webinar format promoted deep learning for each of the topics compared to other standard learning methods (textbook and journal learning). Two-thirds expressed a preference for attending a Webinar rather than an international conference. Over 80% of participants highlighted significant barriers to attending conferences including cost (79%), distance to travel (49%), time commitment (51%), and family commitments (35%). Strengths of the Webinar included expertise, concise high-quality presentations often discussing contentious issues, and the platform quality. The main weakness was a limited time for questions. Just over 53% expressed a concern for the carbon footprint involved in attending conferences and preferred to attend a Webinar. CONCLUSION: E-learning Webinars represent a disruptive innovation, which promotes deep learning, greater multidisciplinary participation, and greater attendee satisfaction with fewer barriers to participation. Although Webinars will never fully replace conferences, a hybrid approach may reduce the need for conferencing, reduce carbon footprint. and promote a ""sustainable academia"".","McMahon, Colin J; Tretter, Justin T; Faulkner, Theresa; Krishna Kumar, R; Redington, Andrew N; Windram, Jonathan D",Cardiol Young,,250

284470,Efficient calibration for imperfect epidemic models with applications to the analysis of COVID-19,2020-09-26,"INTRODUCTION: The genetic variability and diversity of influenza viruses, and the expansion of their hosts, present a significant threat to human health. The development of a universal influenza vaccine is urgently needed to tackle seasonal epidemics, pandemics, vaccine mismatch, and zoonotic transmissions to humans. AREAS COVERED: Despite the identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses, designing a universal influenza vaccine that induces such broadly neutralizing antibodies at protective levels in humans has remained challenging. Besides neutralizing antibodies, multiple correlates of protection have recently emerged as crucially important for eliciting broad protection against diverse influenza viruses. This review discusses the immune responses required for broad protection against influenza viruses, and suggests a paradigm shift from an HA stalk-based approach to other approaches that can induce multiple immunological correlates of protection for the development of a universal influenza vaccine. EXPERT OPINION: To develop a truly universal influenza vaccine, multiple correlates of protection should be considered, including antibody responses and T cell immunity. Balanced induction of neutralizing antibodies, antibody effector functions, and T cell immunity will contribute to the most effective vaccination strategy. Live-attenuated influenza vaccines provide an attractive platform to improve the breadth and potency of vaccines for broader protection.","Jang, Yo Han; Seong, Baik L",Expert Opin Drug Discov,,250
284481,Will there be a demand for diamonds after the pandemic?,2020,"Following its emergence in late 2019, the spread of SARS-CoV-21,2 has been tracked by phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences in unprecedented detail3-5. Although the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced. However, travel within Europe resumed in the summer of 2020. Here we report on a SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20E (EU1), that was identified in Spain in early summer 2020 and subsequently spread across Europe. We find no evidence that this variant has increased transmissibility, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant's success. Despite travel restrictions, we estimate that 20E (EU1) was introduced hundreds of times to European countries by summertime travellers, which is likely to have undermined local efforts to minimize infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our results illustrate how a variant can rapidly become dominant even in the absence of a substantial transmission advantage in favourable epidemiological settings. Genomic surveillance is critical for understanding how travel can affect transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes.","Hodcroft, Emma B; Zuber, Moira; Nadeau, Sarah; Vaughan, Timothy G; Crawford, Katharine H D; Althaus, Christian L; Reichmuth, Martina L; Bowen, John E; Walls, Alexandra C; Corti, Davide; Bloom, Jesse D; Veesler, David; Mateo, David; Hernando, Alberto; Comas, Iñaki; González-Candelas, Fernando; Stadler, Tanja; Neher, Richard A",Nature,,250
285163,Not resuscitating older people,2021,"BACKGROUND: There are concerns that individuals with chronic immune-mediated diseases are at increased risk of COVID-19 and related severe adverse outcome, including intensive care admission or death. We aimed to explore the absolute and relative risk of severe COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: This population-based cohort study used nationwide registers in Sweden, with 67,292 individuals with a diagnosis of IBD 1969-2017 (Crohn's disease, n = 21,599; ulcerative colitis: n = 43,622; IBD-unclassified: n = 2071) and alive on 1 February 2020. Patients with IBD were matched to up to five controls from the general population (n = 297,910). Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for (i) hospital admission with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 as the primary diagnosis, and (ii) severe COVID-19 (composite outcome consisting of (a) COVID-19 intensive care admission, or (b) death from COVID-19 or (c) death within 30 days of COVID-19 hospital admission), were calculated. Analyses were conditioned on age, sex, calendar period, and county and adjusted for other comorbidities. RESULTS: Between 1 February and 31 July 2020, 179 (0.27%) IBD patients and 500 (0.17%) general population controls were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (adjusted HR [aHR] = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.19-1.72). The corresponding numbers for severe COVID-19 was 65 (0.10%) and 183 (0.06%; aHR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.81-1.52). Adjusted HRs were similar in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In a propensity score-matched model taking comorbidity into account until 2016, the increased risk for COVID-19 hospital admission remained (aHR = 1.32; 1.12-1.56), but there was no increased risk of severe COVID-19 (aHR = 1.12; 0.85-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: While individuals with IBD were more likely to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19 than the general population, the risk of severe COVID-19 was not higher.","Ludvigsson, Jonas F; Axelrad, Jordan; Halfvarson, Jonas; Khalili, Hamed; Larsson, Emma; Lochhead, Paul; Roelstraete, Bjorn; Simon, Tracey G; Söderling, Jonas; Olén, Ola",,,250

We report a case of acute parotitis and submandibular sialadenitis from COVID-19 infection in an older adult that contributed to persistent dysphagia. Methods Retrospective chart review. Results An 81-year-old male resident of long-term care with a past medical history of dementia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, diabetes, and depression was hospitalized for acute hypoxic respiratory failure from COVID-19. He was treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. On day 21 of admission, he developed a new right-sided preauricular swelling. Laboratory showed leukocytosis of 12.7. CT head and neck revealed right parotitis with multifocal rim-enhancing collections, numerous small microabscesses, and sialadenitis involving the right subjacent submandibular gland. A subtle enhancement of the left parotid gland was suggestive of additional involvement as well. Parotid drainage was cultured and grew multiple organisms - Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Corynebacterium striatum. The patient was managed conservatively with antibiotics, parotid gland massage, and oral care. Two weeks later, follow-up imaging showed resolving parotitis with a resolution of intraparotid collections. His clinical course was complicated with new-onset persistent dysphagia requiring feeding tube placement at discharge. Conclusions Acute parotitis and sialadenitis are uncommon and underreported manifestations of COVID-19. The onset of symptoms ranges from 3 to 31 days. Interestingly, acute parotitis can also be the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19. The high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the salivary glands make these sites vulnerable to the virus. In our case, the viral sialadenitis led to secondary polymicrobial bacterial microabscesses that required antibiotic therapy. This report underscores sialadenitis as a complication of COVID- 19 infection, which in elderly patients could contribute to persistent symptoms such as dysphagia.","Jongyotha, K.; Rana, S.",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,,250

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic urgently demands for both prevention and treatment strategies. RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), which has no counterpart in human cells, is an excellent target for drug development. Given the time-consuming process of drug development, repurposing drugs approved for other indications or at least successfully tested in terms of safety and tolerability, is an attractive strategy to rapidly provide an effective medication for severe COVID-19 cases. Areas covered. The currently available data and upcoming studies on RdRp which can be repurposed to halt SARS-CoV-2 replication, are reviewed. Expert opinion. Drug repurposing and design of novel compounds are proceeding in parallel to provide a quick response and new specific drugs, respectively. Notably, the proofreading SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease activity could limit the potential for drugs designed as immediate chain terminators and favour the development of compounds acting through delayed termination. While vaccination is awaited to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, even partially effective drugs from repurposing strategies can be of help to treat severe cases of disease. Considering the high conservation of RdRp among coronaviruses, an improved knowledge of its activity in vitro can provide useful information for drug development or drug repurposing to combat SARS-CoV-2 as well as future pandemics.","Vicenti, Ilaria; Zazzi, Maurizio; Saladini, Francesco",,,250

Challenges and opportunities were encountered at the provider, patient, and family levels throughout the rapid transition period from in-person to online care to ensure continuity of services. Institutional, regional, and national policies that impacted the care team's capacity to respond swiftly to patients' changing needs were counterbalanced by those related to standards of care, education and training, and resource constraints. At the policy level, COVID-19 re-exposed a number of long-standing and complicated issues about professional licensure among behavioral health providers at the local and state levels and national long-distance practice restrictions during times of crisis. Issues of insurance reimbursement and regulations intended to protect the public may need to adapt and evolve as the practice of behavioral medicine increasingly takes place remotely, online, and over great distances. The sudden transition to telehealth instigated by COVID-19, in addition to the increasing recognition of the benefits of telehealth to favorably affect the reach and impact of traditional behavioral medicine services, offers an unprecedented opportunity to reimagine the medical home and continuity of care for children with diabetes.","Clary, Lauren; Wang, Christine; Byrne, Meghan E; Monaghan, Maureen",Transl Behav Med,,250
288496,"A new educational normal an intersectionality-led exploration of education, learning technologies, and diversity during COVID-19",2021,"The need for new immunomodulatory drugs is due to the side effects associated with the prolonged use of the currently used immunomodulatory drugs. In this context, the present work aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of an ethanolic concentrated extract from Physalis angulata. The cytotoxicity of samples was determined using peritoneal macrophages though the Alamar Blue assay. The immunomodulatory activity of the ethanolic extract from P. angulata on activated macrophages was determined by measurement of nitrite and cytokine production. The immunosuppressive effects of the ethanolic extract from P. angulata was evaluated on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. The effects of the extract on cell cycle progression and cell death on lymphocytes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Lastly, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata was tested in vivo in toxicological tests and in models of peritonitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity response. The ethanolic extract from P. angulata decreased nitrite, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, and TNF-&#945; production by activated macrophages without affecting the cell viability. In addition, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata inhibited lymphoproliferation and the secretion of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and IFN-Î³, and increased interleukin-4 secretion by activated splenocytes. Flow cytometry analysis in lymphocyte cultures showed that treatment with the ethanolic extract from P. angulata induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase followed by cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, mice treated with the extract from P. angulata at 100 or 200 mg/kg did not show signs of toxicity or alterations in serum components. Finally, the ethanolic extract from P. angulata significantly reduced neutrophil migration and reduced paw edema in bovine serum albumin-induced the delayed-type hypersensitivity response model. Our results demonstrate the potential of the ethanolic extract of P. angulata as an alternative for the treatment of immune-inflammatory diseases.","Daltro, Sérgio Ricardo Teixeira; Santos, Ivanilson Pimenta; Barros, Paula Ladeia; Moreira, Diogo Rodrigo Magalhães; Tomassini, Therezinha Coelho Barbosa; Ribeiro, Ivone Maria; Ribeiro Dos Santos, Ricardo; Meira, Cássio Santana; Soares, Milena Botelho Pereira",Planta med,,250

Here we show RAD27/FEN1, which encodes flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a structure-specific nuclease with roles in DNA replication and repair, and has the greatest number of synthetic lethal interactions with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome instability genes, is a druggable target for an inhibitor-based approach to kill cancers with defects in homologous recombination (HR). The vulnerability of cancers with HR defects to FEN1 loss was validated by studies showing that small-molecule FEN1 inhibitors and FEN1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) selectively killed BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective human cell lines. Furthermore, the differential sensitivity to FEN1 inhibition was recapitulated in mice, where a small-molecule FEN1 inhibitor reduced the growth of tumors established from drug-sensitive but not drug-resistant cancer cell lines. FEN1 inhibition induced a DNA damage response in both sensitive and resistant cell lines; however, sensitive cell lines were unable to recover and replicate DNA even when the inhibitor was removed. Although FEN1 inhibition activated caspase to higher levels in sensitive cells, this apoptotic response occurred in p53-defective cells and cell killing was not blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor. These results suggest that FEN1 inhibitors have the potential for therapeutically targeting HR-defective cancers such as those resulting from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and other genetic defects.","Guo, Elaine; Ishii, Yuki; Mueller, James; Srivatsan, Anjana; Gahman, Timothy; Putnam, Christopher D; Wang, Jean Y J; Kolodner, Richard D",Proc.

Participants ' challenges ranged from lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) to the absence of standardized training. Significant disparities in social determinants of health experienced by Native American and non-Native populations served by UIOs create additional challenges to the delivery of and access to care during the pandemic.

We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates among children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. A well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that Maori and Pacific peoples are at a higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.","James, A; Plank, M J; Binny, R N; Lustig, A; Hannah, K; Hendy, S C; Steyn, N",Math. med. biol,,250

293346,COVID 19 - its Impact on Packaging Research,2020,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is expressed in Barrington's nucleus (BarN), which plays an essential role in the regulation of micturition. To control the neural activities of BarN, glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs from multiple sources have been demonstrated; however, it is not clear how modulatory neurotransmitters affect the activity of BarN neurons. We have employed knock-in mice, CRH-expressing neurons of which are labeled with a modified yellow fluorescent protein (Venus). Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we examined the responses of Venus-expressing (putative CRH-expressing) neurons in BarN (BarCRH), as well as non-CRH-expressing neurons (BarCRH-negative), following bath application of cholinergic agonists. According to the present study, the activity of BarCRH neurons could be modulated by dual cholinergic mechanisms. First, they are inhibited by a muscarinic receptor-mediated mechanism, most likely through the M2 subclass of muscarinic receptors. Second, BarCRH neurons are excited by a nicotinic receptor-mediated mechanism. BarCRH-negative neurons also responded to cholinergic agents. Choline transporter-immunoreactive nerve terminals were observed in close proximity to the neurites, as well as the somata of BarCRH. The present results suggest that BarN neurons are capable of responding to cholinergic input.","Kawatani, Masahiro; Itoi, Keiichi; Talukder, Ashraf Hossain; Uchida, Katsuya; Sakimura, Kenji; Kawatani, Masahito",J. neurophysiol,,250

293821,Investigating and responding to COVID-19 cases at homeless service provider sites,2020,"Mobile phone data -- with file sizes scaling into terabytes -- easily overwhelm the computational capacity available to some researchers. Moreover, for ethical reasons, data access is often granted only to particular subsets, restricting analyses to cover single days, weeks, or geographical areas. Consequently, it is frequently impossible to set a particular analysis or event in its context and know how typical it is, compared to other days, weeks or months. This is important for academic referees questioning research on mobile phone data and for the analysts in deciding how to sample, how much data to process, and which events are anomalous. All these issues require an understanding of variability in Big Data to answer the question of how average is average? This paper provides a method, using a large mobile phone dataset, to answer these basic but necessary questions. We show that file size is a robust proxy for the activity level of phone users by profiling the temporal variability of the data at an hourly, daily and monthly level. We then apply time-series analysis to isolate temporal periodicity. Finally, we discuss confidence limits to anomalous events in the data. We recommend an analytical approach to mobile phone data selection which suggests that ideally data should be sampled across days, across working weeks, and across the year, to obtain a representative average. However, where this is impossible, the temporal variability is such that specific weekdays' data can provide a fair picture of other days in their general structure.","Toger, Marina; Shuttleworth, Ian; Osth, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00137v1.pdf,250

The most severe cases (i.e. those requiring hospitalization) present a higher frequency of sequelae, but detailed information on these effects is still lacking. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify the frequency and outcomes associated with the presence of sequelae or persistent symptomatology (SPS) during the 6 months after discharge for COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective observational 6-month follow-up study conducted in four hospitals of Spain. A cohort of all 969 patients who were hospitalized with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to April 15, 2020, was included. We collected all the SPS during the 6 months after discharge reported by patients during follow-up from primary care records. Cluster analyses were performed to validate the measures. The main outcome measures were return to the Emergency Services, hospital readmission and post-discharge death. Surviving patients' outcomes were collected through clinical histories and primary care reports. Multiple logistic regression models were applied. RESULTS: The 797 (82.2%) patients who survived constituted the sample followed, while the rest died from COVID-19. The mean age was 63.0 years, 53.7% of them were men and 509 (63.9%) reported some sequelae during the first 6 months after discharge. These sequelae were very diverse, but the most frequent were respiratory (42.0%), systemic (36.1%), neurological (20.8%), mental health (12.2%) and infectious (7.9%) SPS, with some differences by sex. Women presented higher frequencies of headache and mental health SPS, among others. A total of 160 (20.1%) patients returned to the Emergency Services, 35 (4.4%) required hospital readmission and 8 (1.0%) died during follow-up. The main factors independently associated with the return to Emergency Services were persistent fever, dermatological SPS, arrythmia or palpitations, thoracic pain and pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the first wave of the pandemic developed a significant range of mid- to long-term SPS. A detailed list of symptoms and outcomes is provided in this multicentre study. Identification of possible factors associated with these SPS could be useful to optimize preventive follow-up strategies in primary care for the coming months of the pandemic.","Romero-Duarte, Álvaro; Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Guerrero-Fernández de Alba, Inmaculada; Pérez-Contreras, Marina; Fernández-Martínez, Nicolás Francisco; Ruiz-Montero, Rafael; Serrano-Ortiz, Álvaro; González-Serna, Rocío Ortiz; Salcedo-Leal, Inmaculada; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio; Cárdenas-Cruz, Antonio",BMC Med,,250

En concreto, se vincularán problemas derivados del constitucionalismo multinivel con el derecho de acceso a la información pública en contexto actual. Se ha visto que la teoría del constitucionalismo multinivel suscita aun problemas metodológicos de integración que pueden causar dificultades en la interpretación de los derechos fundamentales. Esa falta de integración se revela de manera clara en relación con aquellos derechos que están ajustando su alcance y contenido a la luz de la realidad social del momento, y que además cuentan con diverso grado o forma de protección en atención al espacio constitucional en que se estudien. Esta idea es la que justifica la elección del derecho de acceso a la información pública como vehículo para poner de manifiesto algunas cuestiones pendientes de integración en el sistema multinivel. De un lado, el derecho de acceso a la información pública ostenta una relevancia democrática que sin duda alguna se ha visto reforzada en el marco de la actual crisis sanitaria del COVID-19. Podrá comprobarse en este sentido el papel esencial que viene desarrollando el derecho de acceso a la información pública en la gestión nacional e internacional de la pandemia para compensar arbitrariedades, falta de transparencia, inseguridad jurídica y todas las incertidumbres generadas por la propagación de desinformación. A este papel democrático esencial se suma otro dato relevante y es que el análisis del derecho de acceso a la información pública adquiere interés constitucional por sí mismo. Se trata de un derecho sumamente rico, que aporta matices en lo relativo a la interpretación de los derechos, puesto que es objeto de diferente grado o forma de protección a tenor del espacio constitucional en el que se analice (Consejo de Europa, Unión europea y ordenamiento interno español). De manera que, un acercamiento al derecho de acceso a la información pública permitirá reflejar algunas cuestiones pendientes para la interpretación de los derechos en el contexto multinivel.Alternate abstract:The aim of this paper focuses on connecting two key subjects of contemporary constitutionalism. Specifically, problems arising from multilevel constitutionalism will be link with the right of access to public information in the current context. It has been seen that the theory of multilevel constitutionalism still raises integration methodological problems that could cause difficulties in the interpretation of fundamental rights. This lack of integration is clearly revealed in relation to those rights that are adjusting their scope and content in the light of the social reality of the moment, and which also have different degrees or forms of protection depending on the constitutional space in which they are studied. This is the reason which justifies the choice of right of access to public information as vehicle to highlight some of the issues pending integration into the multilevel system. On the one hand, the right of access to public information has a democratic relevance that has undoubtedly been reinforced in the framework of the current health crisis of the COVID-19. In this regard, it will be possible to verify the essential role that the right of access to public information has been playing in the national and international management of the pandemic to compensate for arbitrariness, lack of transparency, legal insecurity and all the uncertainties generated by the spread of disinformation. To this essential democratic role is added another relevant fact, and it is that analysis of the right of access to public information acquires constitutional interest by itself. It is an extremely interesting right, which provides nuances regarding the interpretation of rights, because it is subject to a different degree or form of protection under the constitutional space in which it is analysed (Council of Europe, European Union or Spanish legal system).

295626,"Role of transport network accessibility in the spread of COVID-19 - a case study in Savar Upazila, Bangladesh",2021,"The conceptual research aims to identify antecedents conducive to bilateral trade during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the relevance of bilateral trade for foreign policy and economy studies, there is a need for a renewed framework in times of extreme economic instability. As international commerce is essential for improving the country’s economy, we have examined how economic distance, population, trade percentage of GDP, exchange rate, and political changes interconnect and relate to COVID-19, influencing trade flows. This conceptual paper illustrates the likely impact of COVID-19 on international trade by exploring pandemics’ effects on standard trading parameters such as GDP, distance, policy stability, and population. We model the resulting shock as a multifaceted variable reflected in capital underutilization, manufacturing output decline, international trade costs inflation, production costs inflation, decrease in demand for certain services and shift from everyday needs towards activities that exclude the proximity between people, e.g., proclivity towards virtual market products. The sudden decrease in GDP and bilateral trade, as well as FDI, is amplified by further development of pandemics’ long-term consequences. We take COVID-19 to be a technological, financial, and policy shock significantly influencing international trade and economic development and argue that it will have a varying impact on diverse sectors and economies. The paper offers preliminary insight into the pandemic-related economics that are unfolding and deduce recommendations on positive changes in trading policy to fully leverage on arising trading opportunities and point to potential research directions.","Saif, Nashwan M.

(preprint),2021,"Background/Case Studies: Beginning in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Transfusion Medicine had to prepare for an anticipated blood shortage due to a lack of blood donation across the United States In collaboration with Medical Directors, Laboratory Managers and hospital leadership, transfusion restrictions based on lab indication were set to limit the number of blood products used during the pandemic Consequently, in the weeks after transfusion restrictions were imposed, significantly less packed red blood cells (pRBC) and platelets (PLT) were transfused The scope of the reduction in transfused blood products to the hematology oncology population was investigated Study Design/Methods: On March 14, 2020, transfusion restrictions were implemented Patients who had a hemoglobin above 7 0 g/dl were not eligible to receive pRBC Patients who had a platelet count above 50 × 109/L or had received a unit of PLT in the last 24 hours were also not eligible to receive a unit of PLT If a patient was not able to receive the requested blood product per these restrictions, the pathology resident would investigate whether the product was needed given the circumstances and the patient's conditions Blood utilization of pRBC and PLT were analyzed for six weeks prior to the transfusion restrictions and for three, six-week intervals following transfusion restrictions Results/Findings: Transfusion Medicine observed over a twenty percent reduction in transfusions in both pRBC and PLT immediately following transfusion restrictions Transfusion rates have steadily increased since the initial implementation, however, transfusion rates of pRBC and PLT are still significantly lower than transfusion rates prior to transfusion restrictions Conclusions: While a decrease in transfused products was expected, it is unclear if the transfusion restrictions were the main driver of this decrease Other factors may include, but are not limited to, avoidance of the hospital due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government imposed “stay at home” orders or clinicians extending time between each patients' appointments A follow-up study should be conducted once the transfusion restrictions have been lifted to investigate if transfusion practices have changed","Jones, K.; Armstrong, S.

The objective of the present study was to examine perceptions of how weight-related lifestyle changed in social lockdown among UK adults compared with before the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: As part of an online cross-sectional survey conducted during social lockdown in the United Kingdom, 723 UK adults reported on the extent to which their eating (healthiness of diet, frequency of bingeing on food), physical activity, sleep and alcohol consumption had changed since the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis and completed measures of current psychological well-being. Results: Although both improvements and declines in weight gain protective behaviours were reported, 79% of participants reported a decline in one or more weight gain protective behaviours. Both participants with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30) were most likely to report declines in weight gain protective behaviours and show an overall profile of weight management behaviours worsening. Participants experiencing high levels of stress also reported reductions in more weight gain protective behaviours. Conclusions: Lifestyle behaviours associated with weight gain are likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Reductions to the perceived frequency by which people engage in behaviours usually associated with successful weight management appear to be common, and people living with obesity and mental health problems may be at increased risk.","Robinson, Eric; Gillespie, Steven; Jones, Andrew",Obes.

Two major events have occurred in the past 18âmonths: COVID-19 pandemic, and the first world consensus conference on PT. Several innovative studies were published after the consensus conference. RECENT FINDINGS: During COVID-19 pandemic PT activity decreased. COVID-19 in transplant recipients increases mortality rates, but data from kidney transplantation show that mortality might be higher in waitlisted patients.The world consensus conference provided 49 jury deliberations on the impact of PT on management of diabetic patients and 110 practice recommendations.Recent evidence demonstrates that PT alone is safe and effective, that results of simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) remain excellent despite older recipient age and higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, that use of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive donors into HCV-negative recipients is associated with good outcomes, and that use of sirolimus as primary immunosuppressant and costimulation blockade does not improve results of SPK. SUMMARY: COVID-19 pandemic and the first world consensus conference on PT were major events. Although COVID-19 pandemic should not reduce PT activity in the future, a major positive impact on both volume and outcomes of PT is awaited from the proceedings of the world consensus conference.","Vistoli, Fabio; Kauffmann, Emanuele F; Boggi, Ugo",Curr Opin Organ Transplant,,250

This study aims to objectively investigate the impact of Pulse D therapy in reducing the inflammatory markers of COVID-19. Consented COVID-19 patients with hypovitaminosis D were evaluated for inflammatory markers (N/L ratio, CRP, LDH, IL6, Ferritin) along with vitamin D on 0th day and 9th/11th day as per their respective BMI category. Subjects were randomised into VD and NVD groups. VD group received Pulse D therapy (targeted daily supplementation of 60,000 IUs of vitamin D for 8 or 10 days depending upon their BMI) in addition to the standard treatment. NVD group received standard treatment alone. Differences in the variables between the two groups were analysed for statistical significance. Eighty seven out of one hundred and thirty subjects have completed the study (VD:44, NVD:43). Vitamin D level has increased from 16 ± 6 ng/ml to 89 ± 32 ng/ml after Pulse D therapy in VD group and highly significant (p < 0.01) reduction of all the measured inflammatory markers was noted. Reduction of markers in NVD group was insignificant (p > 0.05). The difference in the reduction of markers between the groups (NVD vs VD) was highly significant (p < 0.01). Therapeutic improvement in vitamin D to 80-100 ng/ml has significantly reduced the inflammatory markers associated with COVID-19 without any side effects. Hence, adjunctive Pulse D therapy can be added safely to the existing treatment protocols of COVID-19 for improved outcomes.","Lakkireddy, Maheshwar; Gadiga, Srikanth Goud; Malathi, R D; Karra, Madhu Latha; Raju, I S S V Prasad Murthy; Chinapaka, Sangeetha; Baba, K S S Sai; Kandakatla, Manohar",Sci Rep,,250

Preven-tive measures such as hygiene, social distancing, and isolation, essential to stop the spread of coronavirus, are difficult to accomplish for vulnerable populations due to their living conditions. Seroepidemiological surveys are assets to measure the transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Until July 1st, the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Barrio Padre Mugica, one of the largest slums in Buenos Aires City, was 5.9%. This study aimed to establish the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies immunoglobulin G (IgG) immediately after the outbreak, and to identify neighbourhood, household and individual factors associated with seroconversion. The prevalence based on IgG was 53.4% (95% CI 52.8% to 54.1%). For each polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) confirmed case, nine people tested IgG positive, indicating a high rate of undetected (probably asymptomatic) infections. Hence, the high rate of undiagnosed people suggests that clinical criteria and epidemiological nexus should be considered. The high seroprevalence observed in the context of an intense epidemic in a vulnerable area might serve as a reference to other countries. This study contributes to future decision making by understanding population immunity against SARS-CoV2 and its relation to living conditions and foccus that comprehensive biosocial, household-level interventions are needed.","Figar, S.; Pagotto, V.; Luna, L.; Salto, J.; Wagner Manslau, M.; Mistchenko, A.

Our aim was to highlight the significance of a holistic approach to the patient, and scrupulous documentation of existing somatic diseases in psychiatric hospital discharge summary reports. Due to the common lack of compliance on the part of psychiatric patients, it proves utterly important to establish cooperation between healthcare providers and families of the mentally ill. Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) becomes another, additional complication in the management of psychiatric inpatients. We believe that the discussed interdisciplinary approach, together with increased family or institutional supervision can contribute to the improvement of psychiatric patients' physical and mental health status as well as general functioning.","Wroński, Michał; Dukaczewska, Zuzanna; Samochowiec, Jerzy",Psychiatria,,250
296225,The growth and development analytical controversies in economic science: A reassessment for the post-Covid-19 era,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The dimeric form of the viral Mpro is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein in 11 sites, including its own N and C-terminus. The lack of structural information for intermediary forms of Mpro is a setback for the understanding its self-maturation process. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography combined with biochemical data to characterize multiple forms of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. For the immature form, we show that extra N-terminal residues caused conformational changes in the positioning of domain-three over the active site, hampering the dimerization and diminishing its activity. We propose that this form preludes the cis and trans-cleavage of N-terminal residues. Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the Mpro bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during dimeric association stage of the maturation process. We suggest this form is a transitional state during the C-terminal trans-cleavage. This data sheds light in the structural modifications of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease during its self-maturation process.","Noske, G D; Nakamura, A M; Gawriljuk, V O; Fernandes, R S; Lima, G M A; Rosa, H V D; Pereira, H D; Zeri, A C M; Nascimento, A F Z; Freire, M C L C; Fearon, D; Douangamath, A; von Delft, F; Oliva, G; Godoy, A S",J Mol Biol,,250

METHODS: A literature review about the basis of the ongoing clinical trials using BCG against COVID-19, as well as the use of BCG in urology and if there are any implications of these trials on our practice. RESULTS: Based on data from some epidemiological studies, there are some current clinical trials on the use BCG as a possible prophylactic vaccine against SARS CoV-2 which can affect urology practice. Urologists are already struggling with the global shortage of BCG which can be even more aggravated by such trials. In addition, if the ongoing trials proved the efficacy of BCG as a prophylaxis against COVID-19, this may open the door to more urological research opportunities to question the possibility that intra-vesical BCG, given its systemic immunologic effect, may have been protective to this subgroup of urological patients. CONCLUSION: The ongoing clinical trials using BCG against COVID-19 can affect our urology practice.

Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 will be recruited as donors of CP. The recovery criteria are normality of body temperature for more than 3 days, resolution of respiratory symptoms, two consecutively negative results of sputum SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR assay (at least 24 hours apart) 22 to 35 days of post onset period, and neutralizing antibody titre &#8805; 1:160. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: This RCT consists of three arms, a. standard care, b. standard care and 200 ml CP and c. standard care and 400 ml CP. Patients will receive plasma as a single transfusion. Intervention arms will be compared to the standard care arm. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be time to clinical improvement within seven days of treatment or until discharge whichever is later and in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome would be improvement of laboratory parameters after therapy (neutrophil, lymphocyte ratio, CRP, serum ferritin, SGPT, SGOT, serum creatinine and radiology), length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, reduction in proportion of deaths, requirement of ventilator and duration of oxygen and ventilator support. RANDOMISATION: Randomization will be done by someone not associated with the care or assessment of the patients by means of a computer generated random number table using an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open level study; neither the physician nor the patients will be blinded. However, the primary and secondary outcome (oxygen saturations, PaO2/FiO2, BP, day specific laboratory tests) will be recorded using an objective automated method; the study staff will not be able to influence the recording of these data. NUMBER TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): No similar study has been performed previously. Therefore no data are available that could be used to generate a sample size calculation. This phase II study is required to provide some initial data on efficacy and safety that will allow design of a larger study. The trial will recruit 60 participants (20 in each arm).

Our study aimed to quantify the performance of available antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) in a real-world hospital setting. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, the diagnostic performance of 7 Ag-RDTs was compared with real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay in terms of sensitivity, specificity and expected predictive values. RESULTS: A total of 321 matched Ag-RDTreal-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction samples were analyzed retrospectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Ag-RDTs was 78.7% and 100%, respectively. However, a wide range of sensitivity estimates by brand (66.0%-93.8%) and cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off values (Ct <25: 96.2%; Ct 30-35: 31.1%) was observed. The optimal Ct cut-off value that maximized sensitivity was 29. CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of Ag-RDTs may be convenient in moderate-to-high intensity settings when high volumes of specimens are tested every day. However, the diagnostic performance of the commercially available tests may differ substantially.","Bruzzone, Bianca; De Pace, Vanessa; Caligiuri, Patrizia; Ricucci, Valentina; Guarona, Giulia; Pennati, Beatrice M; Boccotti, Simona; Orsi, Andrea; Domnich, Alexander; Da Rin, Giorgio; Icardi, Giancarlo",Int J Infect Dis,,250

301704,Occupational Exposure to Contagion and the Spread of COVID-19 in Europe,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shocked the world by its spread and contagiousness. There is no approved vaccine and no proven treatment for this infection. Some potential treatments that have already been associated with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects are under investigation. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a photon-based therapy that uses light to mediate a variety of metabolic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. Antiviral photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a branch of photodynamic therapy based on the reaction between a photosensitizing agent and a light source in the presence of oxygen, which can produce oxidative and free radical agents to damage the viral structures such as proteins and nucleic acids. This chapter aims to discuss the potential therapeutic benefit of PBMT and aPDT in the context of the novel coronavirus. Studies indicate that PBMT and aPDT could be useful in many viral and bacterial pulmonary complications like influenza, SARS-CoV, and MERS, but we found no direct study on SARS-CoV-2. With a combination of PBMT and aPDT, we may be able to combat COVID-19 with minimal interference with pharmaceutical agents. It might improve the efficacy of PBMT and aPDT by using monoclonal antibodies and preparing new photosensitizers at the nanoscale that target the lung tissue specifically. More animal and human studies would need to take place to reach an effective protocol. This chapter would encourage other scientists to work on this new platform.","Fekrazad, Reza; Asefi, Sohrab; Pourhajibagher, Maryam; Vahdatinia, Farshid; Fekrazad, Sepehr; Bahador, Abbas; Abrahamse, Heidi; Hamblin, Michael R",Adv Exp Med Biol,,250

302093,"Coronavirus Cavalry: Amid COVID-19 Chaos, Latin America’s Armed Forces Redeploy at Home",2021,"From the beginning of 2020, an urgent need to understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), much of which is due to dysbalanced immune responses, resonates across the world. COVID-19-associated neutrophilia, increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, aberrant neutrophil activation, and infiltration of neutrophils into lungs suggest that neutrophils are important players in the disease immunopathology. The main objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and functional characteristics of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients, with particular focus on the interaction between neutrophils and T cells. We hypothesize that the altered functional characteristics of COVID-19 patient-derived neutrophils result in skewed Th1/Th17 adaptive immune response, thus contributing to disease pathology. The expansion of G-MDSC and immature forms of neutrophils was shown in the COVID-19 patients. In the COVID-19 neutrophil/T cell cocultures, neutrophils caused a strong polarity shift toward Th17, and, conversely, a reduction of IFNÎ³-producing Th1 cells. The Th17 promotion was NOS dependent. Neutrophils, the known modulators of adaptive immunity, skew the polarization of T cells toward the Th17 promotion and Th1 suppression in COVID-19 patients, contributing to the discoordinated orchestration of immune response against SARS-CoV-2. As IL-17 and other Th17-related cytokines have previously been shown to correlate with the disease severity, we suggest that targeting neutrophils and/or Th17 represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients.","Parackova, Zuzana; Bloomfield, Marketa; Klocperk, Adam; Sediva, Anna",J. leukoc. biol,,250

Although marketed as a safer alternative to hormone therapy, red clover isoflavones have been reported to inhibit some cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in drug metabolism. To evaluate the potential for clinically relevant drug-red clover interactions, we tested a standardized red clover dietary supplement (120 mg isoflavones per day) for interactions with the pharmacokinetics of four FDA-approved drugs (caffeine, tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, and alprazolam) as probe substrates for the enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5, respectively. Fifteen peri- and postmenopausal women completed pharmacokinetic studies at baseline and 2 weeks after consuming red clover. The averaged pharmacokinetic profiles of probe substrates in serum showed no significant alterations and no changes in the areas under the curve (AUC) over 96 h. Subgroup analysis based on the demographic characteristics (BMI, menopausal status, race, and age) also showed no differences in AUC for each probe substrate.

As an example, we used reported data on viral load for 30 hospitalized patients from multiple countries (Singapore, China, Germany, and Korea) and estimated the incubation period. The median, 2.5, and 97.5 percentiles of the incubation period were 5.85 days (95 % CI: 5.05, 6.77), 2.65 days (2.04, 3.41), and 12.99 days (9.98, 16.79), respectively, which are comparable to the values estimated in previous studies.

Concurrently, macrophages shift between alternate and classical activation. A key enzyme upregulated in alternatively activated macrophages is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which converts tryptophan to kynurenine for de novo synthesis of nicotinamide. Nicotinamide can be used to replenish cellular NAD+ supplies. We hypothesize that an insufficient cellular NAD+ supply is the root cause of metabolic shifts in macrophages. We assert that manipulation of nicotinamide pathways may correct deleterious immune responses. We propose evaluation of nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) and analogues, including isoniazid, nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside, as potential therapy for infectious causes of sepsis, including COVID-19.","Suchard, Melinda S; Savulescu, Dana M",FEBS j,,250

In 2018 the flu vaccination was first provided at community pharmacies in Estonia. The aims of this study were to evaluate the experience of flu vaccination at community pharmacies by pharmacy customers and to learn about the perception of community pharmacists regarding the immunization service. METHOD: Two cross-sectional surveys: among pharmacy customers after receiving flu vaccination (n = 257), and for pharmacy professionals (n = 209). Descriptive statistics were calculated in both studies. RESULTS: In the pharmacy customers` study, 54.9% received flu vaccination for the first time. Most of the respondents (96.8%) were satisfied with the quality of service. In both studies, community pharmacies were described as an accessible and convenient setting for immunization. Age and working experience of pharmacy professionals influenced the readiness to provide flu immunization, with younger pharmacists (<36 years) keener to be involved in vaccination services (p < 0.01). EXPERT OPINION: Increasing influenza vaccination in high-risk patient groups is crucial. The involvement of other healthcare professionals, such as community pharmacists, could be key to reaching these patient groups and improving access to vaccination services in general. The development of the pharmacy profession has also shifted from pharmaceutical product based to patient oriented approach with provision of more clinical services. This enables to use professional competency of pharmacists in healthcare more widely. Lack of resources (financial, healthcare professionals, etc.) and an aging population are driving new ways to deliver healthcare more efficiently with the pharmacist working with other healthcare providers taking greater responsibility for patient health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Vaccination service at community pharmacy has a great potential to expand flu immunization coverage in Estonia. Despite on pharmacy professionals are not allowed to provide vaccination service at the moment, their contribution to increase public awareness about flu vaccination is significant.","Sepp, Kristiina; Kukk, Carmen; Cavaco, Afonso; Volmer, Daisy",Expert Rev Vaccines,,250

Chest CT scan revealed 61.11% bilateral pneumonia and 36.11% unilateral pneumonia. 47.22% of the infants developed complications. Increased leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes were observed in 11.11, 8.33, 36.11 and 44.44% of infants, respectively. Decreased leucocytes, neutrophils, thrombocyte and hemoglobin were observed in 8.33, 19.44, 2.78 and 36.11% of infants, respectively. Increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase and D-dimer were observed in 19.44, 67.74, 47.22, 19.44, 22.22 and 20.69% of infants, respectively. Only one infant had a high level of creatinine. Co-infections with other respiratory pathogens were observed in 62.86% of infants. CD3 (20.69%), CD4 (68.97%), CD19 (31.03%) and Th/Ts (44.83%) were elevated; CD8 (6.9%) and CD16+CD56 (48.28%) was reduced. IL-4 (7.69%), IL-6 (19.23%), IL-10 (50%), TNF-&#945; (11.54%) and IFN-Î³ (19.23%) were elevated. Up to March 22, 97.22% of infants recovered, while a critical ill infant died. When the infant's condition deteriorates rapidly, lymphocytopenia was discovered. Meanwhile, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, creatinine, IL-6 and IL-10 increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In the cohort, we discovered that lymphocytosis, elevated CD4 and IL-10, and co-infections were common in infants with COVID-19, which were different from adults with COVID-19. Most infants with COVID-19 have mild clinical symptoms and good prognosis.","Sun, Dan; Chen, Xue; Li, Hui; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Xiao, Han; Zhang, Fu-Rong; Liu, Zhi-Sheng",World J Pediatr,,250

(preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19 disease) exposure in pregnancy, compared to non-exposure, is associated with infection-related obstetric morbidity. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre prospective study in pregnancy based on a universal antenatal screening program for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Throughout Spain 45 hospitals tested all women at admission on delivery ward using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) for COVID-19 since late March 2020. The cohort of positive mothers and the concurrent sample of negative mothers was followed up until 6-weeks post-partum. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for known confounding variables, determined the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preterm delivery (primary), premature rupture of membranes and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. RESULTS: Among 1009 screened pregnancies, 246 were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Compared to negative mothers (763 cases), SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the odds of preterm birth (34 vs 51, 13.8% vs 6.7%, aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.32-3.36, p = 0.002); iatrogenic preterm delivery was more frequent in infected women (4.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.001), while the occurrence of spontaneous preterm deliveries was statistically similar (6.1% vs 4.7%). An increased risk of premature rupture of membranes at term (39 vs 75, 15.8% vs 9.8%, aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.57, p = 0.013) and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (23 vs 18, 9.3% vs 2.4%, aOR 4.62, 95% CI 2.43-8.94, p < 0.001) was also observed in positive mothers. CONCLUSION: This prospective multicentre study demonstrated that pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 have more infection-related obstetric morbidity. This hypothesis merits evaluation of a causal association in further research.","Martinez-Perez, Oscar; Prats Rodriguez, Pilar; Muner Hernandez, Marta; Encinas Pardilla, Maria Begoña; Perez Perez, Noelia; Vila Hernandez, Maria Rosa; Villalba Yarza, Ana; Nieto Velasco, Olga; Del Barrio Fernandez, Pablo Guillermo; Forcen Acebal, Laura; Orizales Lago, Carmen Maria; Martinez Varea, Alicia; Muñoz Abellana, Begoña; Suarez Arana, Maria; Fuentes Ricoy, Laura; Martinez Diago, Clara; Janeiro Freire, Maria Jesus; Alférez Alvarez-Mallo, Macarena; Casanova Pedraz, Cristina; Alomar Mateu, Onofre; Lesmes Heredia, Cristina; Wizner de Alva, Juan Carlos; Bernardo Vega, Rut; Macia Badia, Montserrat; Alvarez Colomo, Cristina; Sanchez Muñoz, Antonio; Pratcorona Alicart, Laia; Alonso Saiz, Ruben; Lopez Rodriguez, Monica; Del Carmen Barbancho Lopez, Maria; Meca Casbas, Marta Ruth; Vaquerizo Ruiz, Oscar; Moran Antolin, Eva; Nuñez Valera, Maria Jose; Fernandez Fernandez, Camino; Tubau Navarra, Albert; Cano Garcia, Alejandra Maria; Baena Luque, Carmen; Soldevilla Perez, Susana; Gastaca Abasolo, Irene; Adanez Garcia, Jose; Teulon Gonzalez, Maria; Puertas Prieto, Alberto; Ostos Serna, Rosa; Del Pilar Guadix Martin, Maria; Catalina Coello, Monica; Ferriols Perez, Elena; Caño Aguilar, Africa; De la Cruz Conty, Maria Luisa; Sainz Bueno, Jose Antonio",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,250

The Western blot showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins were expressed in human immortalized conjunctival cells, and this was confirmed by confocal microscopy images, that demonstrated a marked cellular expression of the viral receptors and their co-localization on the cell membranes. Healthy conjunctival samples from 11 adult patients were excised during retinal detachment surgery. We found the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in all the conjunctival surgical specimens analyzed and their co-localization in the superficial conjunctival epithelium. The ACE2 Western blot levels and immunofluorescence staining for ACE2 were variable among specimens. These results suggest the susceptibility of the conjunctival epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even though with a possible interindividual variability.","Mencucci, Rita; Favuzza, Eleonora; Becatti, Matteo; Tani, Alessia; Mazzantini, Costanza; Vignapiano, Roberto; Fiorillo, Claudia; Pellegrini-Giampietro, DomenicoE; Manetti, Mirko; Marini, Mirca; Landucci, Elisa",Exp Eye Res,,250
305346,User-centered Design and Covid-19,2020,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in December 2019 in China, medical staff went to work across the country to combat widespread infection. When health workers are suddenly faced with such a serious event, it is important to assess their mental health in order to determine whether they can meet the challenge effectively. Herein, Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was used to assess the psychological problems of 382 front-line medical staff in Chongqing. The average SCL-90 score was low, and no specific mental health problems were found. With the exception of the phobic-anxiety factor, the scores were close to normal values. A single-factor analysis of variance showed that the SCL-90 scores of male and older staff were higher than those of female and younger staff, implying that they were at greater psychological risk. We found that both gender and age have a significant impact on mental health, and our findings suggest that more attention should be given to the mental health of male and older front-line medical staff.","Wang, Shasha; Li, Ying; Li, Xin; Du, Cuiping; Yang, Yi; Xiong, Xiaoli; Wang, Yao",Psychol Health Med,,250

306172,Business and consumer uncertainty in the face of the pandemic: A sector analysis in European countries,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND: The surge of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations in New York City required rapid discharges to maintain hospital capacity. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether lenient provisional discharge guidelines with remote monitoring after discharge resulted in safe discharges home for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness. DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Tertiary care medical center PATIENTS: Consecutive adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness between March 26, 2020, and April 8, 2020, with a subset discharged home INTERVENTIONS: COVID-19 Discharge Care Program consisting of lenient provisional inpatient discharge criteria and option for daily telephone monitoring for up to 14 days after discharge MEASUREMENTS: Fourteen-day emergency department (ED) visits and hospital readmissions RESULTS: Among 812 patients with COVID-19 illness hospitalized during the study time period, 15.5% died prior to discharge, 24.1% remained hospitalized, 10.0% were discharged to another facility, and 50.4% were discharged home. Characteristics of the 409 patients discharged home were mean (SD) age 57.3 (16.6) years; 245 (59.9%) male; 27 (6.6%) with temperature &#8805; 100.4 °F; and 154 (37.7%) with oxygen saturation < 95% on day of discharge. Over 14 days of follow-up, 45 patients (11.0%) returned to the ED, of whom 31 patients (7.6%) were readmitted. Compared to patients not referred, patients referred for remote monitoring had fewer ED visits (8.3% vs 14.1%; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31-1.15, p = 0.12) and readmissions (6.9% vs 8.3%; OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.52-2.52, p = 0.73). LIMITATIONS: Single-center study; assignment to remote monitoring was not randomized. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 surge in New York City, lenient discharge criteria in conjunction with remote monitoring after discharge were associated with a rate of early readmissions after COVID-related hospitalizations that was comparable to the rate of readmissions after other reasons for hospitalization before the COVID pandemic.","Ye, Siqin; Hiura, Grant; Fleck, Elaine; Garcia, Aury; Geleris, Joshua; Lee, Paul; Liyanage-Don, Nadia; Moise, Nathalie; Schluger, Neil; Singer, Jessica; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena; Sun, Yifei; West, Harry; Kronish, Ian M",J. gen. intern. med,,250

METHODS: Demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, treatments and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy-fourCOVID-19 patients with diabetes were included. Twenty-seven patients (36.5%) were severe and 10 patients (13.5%) died. Higher levels of blood glucose, serum amyloid A (SAA), C reactive protein and interleukin 6 were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe ones (P<0.05). Levels of albumin, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, small and dense low density lipoprotein and CD4+T lymphocyte counts in severe patients were lower than those in non-severe patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified decreased CD4+T lymphocyte counts (odds ratio [OR]=0.988, 95%Confidence interval [95%CI] 0.979-0.997) and increased SAA levels (OR=1.029, 95%CI 1.002-1.058) as risk factors for severity of COVID-19 with diabetes (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic patients were more susceptible to COVID-19 than overall population, which might be associated with hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Aggressive treatment should be suggested, especially when these patients had low CD4+T lymphocyte counts and high SAA levels.","Zhang, Qianhui; Wei, Yanhong; Chen, Min; Wan, Qianqian; Chen, Xiaoqi",J Diabetes Complications,,250

306994,Media representations of nurses in the pandemic: Just doing our job?,2020,"Mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, contribute to â¼35% of cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). A common clinical picture in children with JMML is that it presents as a constitutive hyperinflammatory syndrome, partially reminiscent of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in adults. Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily conserved mouse lncRNA Morrbid is specifically expressed in myeloid cells and uniquely represses the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim to regulate the lifespan of myeloid cells. However, its role in JMML has not been investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of Morrbid and its target Bim, which are significantly dysregulated in Shp2E76K/+-bearing myeloid cells, in driving JMML. Loss of Morrbid in a mouse model of JMML driven by the Shp2E76K/+ mutation resulted in a significant correction of myeloid and erythroid cell abnormalities associated with JMML, including overall survival. Consistently, patients with JMML who had PTPN11, KRAS, and NRAS mutations and high expression of MORRBID manifested poor overall survival. Our results suggest that Morrbid contributes to JMML pathogenesis.","Cai, Zhigang; Zhang, Chi; Kotzin, Jonathan J; Williams, Adam; Henao-Mejia, Jorge; Kapur, Reuben",Blood Adv,,250
307334,BME Labs in the Era of COVID-19: Transitioning a Hands-on Integrative Lab Experience to Remote Instruction Using Gamified Lab Simulations,2020,"Inconsistencies in the preparation of histology slides and whole slide images (WSI) may lead to challenges with subsequent image analysis and machine learning approaches for interrogating the WSI. These variabilities are especially pronounced in multicenter cohorts, where batch effects (i.e. systematic technical artifacts unrelated to biological variability) may introduce biases to machine learning algorithms. To date, manual quality control (QC) has been the de facto standard for dataset curation but remains highly subjective and is too laborious in light of the increasing scale of tissue slide digitization efforts. This study aimed to evaluate a computer aided QC pipeline for facilitating a reproducible QC process of WSI datasets. An open source tool, HistoQC, was employed to identify image artifacts and compute quantitative metrics describing visual attributes of WSIs to the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) digital pathology repository. A comparison in inter-reader concordance between HistoQC aided and un-aided curation was performed to quantify improvements in curation reproducibility. HistoQC metrics were additionally employed to quantify the presence of batch effects within NEPTUNE WSIs. Of the 1814 WSIs (458 H&E, 470 PAS, 438 Silver, 448 Trichrome) from n = 512 cases considered in this study, approximately 9% (163) were identified as unsuitable for subsequent computational analysis. The concordance in the identification of these WSIs among computational pathologists rose from moderate (Gwet's AC1 range 0.43 to 0.59 across stains) to excellent (Gwet's AC1 range 0.79 to 0.93 across stains) agreement when aided by HistoQC. Furthermore, statistically significant batch effects (p < 0.001) in the NEPTUNE WSI dataset were discovered. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that quantitative QC is a necessary step in the curation of digital pathology cohorts. This article is protected by copyright.

307717,Quantifying COVID-19 enforced global changes in atmospheric pollutants using cloud computing based remote sensing,2021-01-10,"Background: We investigated six London care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak and found high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents and staff. Here we report follow-up investigations including antibody testing in the same care homes five weeks later. Methods: Residents and staff in the initial investigation had a repeat nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a blood test for SARS CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA based on SARS-CoV-2 native viral antigens derived from infected cells and virus neutralisation. Findings: Of the 518 residents and staff in the initial investigation, 186/241 (77.2%) surviving residents and 208/254 (81.9%) staff underwent serological testing. Almost all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive residents and staff were seropositive five weeks later, whether symptomatic (residents 35/35, 100%; staff, 22/22, 100%) or asymptomatic (residents 32/33, 97.0%; staff 21/22, 95.5%). Symptomatic but SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative residents and staff also had high seropositivity rates (residents 23/27, 85.2%; staff 18/21, 85.7%), as did asymptomatic RT-PCR negative individuals (residents 61/91, 67.0%; staff 95/143, 66.4%). Neutralising antibody was detected in 118/132 (89.4%) seropositive individuals and was not associated with age or symptoms. Ten residents (10/79 re-tested, 12.7%) remained RT-PCR positive but with higher RT-PCR cycle threshold values; 7/10 had serological testing and all were seropositive. New infections were detected in three residents and one staff. Interpretation: RT-PCR provides a point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection but significantly underestimates total exposure in outbreak settings. In care homes experiencing large COVID-19 outbreaks, most residents and staff had neutralising SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which was not associated with age or symptoms.

307991,On the parametrization of epidemiologic models -- lessons from modelling COVID-19 epidemic,2021-09-23,"Several public health measures have been implemented to contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The adherence to control measures is known to be influenced by people's knowledge, attitudes and practices with regard to the disease. This study aimed at assessing COVID-19 knowledge in individuals who were tested for the virus. An online cross-sectional survey of 32 items, adapted to the national context, was conducted among 1656 Ecuadorians. The mean knowledge score was 22.5 ± 3 out of 28, with significant differences being observed with regard to educational attainment. People with postgraduate training scored higher than those with college, secondary and elementary instruction. Indeed, multiple linear regression revealed that lower scores were associated significantly with the latter three levels of education. Interviewees were knowledgeable about the symptoms, detection, transmission and prevention of the disease. However, they were less assertive regarding the characteristics of the virus as well as the usefulness of traditional and unproven treatments. These outcomes indicated a lack of knowledge in fundamental aspects of virus biology, which may limit the effectiveness of further prevention campaigns. Conclusively, educational and communicational programs must place emphasis on explaining the basic molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2; such information will certainly contribute to improve the public's adherence to control measures.","Ortega-Paredes, David; Zurita, Jeannete; Zurita, Camilo; Leoro-Garzón, Paula; Leoro-Monroy, Galo; Larrea-Álvarez, César Marcelo; Loaiza, Karen; Fernandez-Moreira, Esteban; Molina-Cuasapaz, Gabriel; Larrea-Álvarez, Marco",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,250
308535,Covid-19: Art installation at NHS trust represents beacon of hope and gratitude,2021,"Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unresponsive to conventional ICU management is an accepted indication for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) support. The frequency with which patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are selected for V-V ECMO has not been described. This was a cohort study including all patients placed on either V-V ECMO or V-AV ECMO at the four adult ECMO Centers of Excellence. Primary outcomes evaluated were survival to decannulation from the ECMO circuit, survival to discharge, and 60-day survival. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, length of ECMO cannulation, and length of intubation. During the study period, which corresponded to the first surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations in Minnesota, 35 patients with ARDS were selected for V-V ECMO support out of 1849 adult ICU patients with COVID-19 infection in the state (1.9% incidence, 95% CI 1.3%-2.6%). This represents 46 (95% CI 34-61) expected V-V ECMO patients per 100,000 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. Twenty-six of the 35 patients (74.3%) supported with V-V ECMO survived to 60 days post-ECMO decannulation. Recent studies have demonstrated ongoing success rescuing patients with severe ARDS in COVID-19 infection. Our data adds to the support of ECMO and the consideration for encouraging cooperation amongst regional ECMO centers to ensure access to this highest level of care. Finally, by evaluating all the patients of a single region, we estimate overall need for this resource intensive intervention based on the overall number of COVID-19 cases and ICU admissions.","Bergman, Zachary R; Wothe, Jillian K; Alwan, Fatima S; Dunn, Alex; Lusczek, Elizabeth R; Lofrano, Arianna E; Tointon, Kelly M; Doucette, Melissa; Bohman, John K; Saavedra-Romero, Ramiro; Prekker, Matthew E; Brunsvold, Melissa E",ASAIO. j,,250

309670,Management of Diabetes During a Dual Pandemic,2021,"Since the end of 2019, China and other regions around the world have been facing a pandemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). The virus is highly transmissible, and the human population is generally susceptible. Most patients with osteoporosis are postmenopausal women or elderly people with hypoimmunity, so the osteoporosis clinic has become a new hotspot for corona virus infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to establish standardized out-patient protocols to provide safe and effective treatment for osteoporosis patients and medical staff. In an osteoporosis clinic, we advocate the following suggestions to prevent and control osteoporosis during the pandemic period: (1) specialized diagnosis and treatment techniques for osteoporosis patients in the outpatient care, including enhancing the prevention for outpatient medical staff, strengthening awareness of COVID-19 prevention, strictly screening outpatients with COVID-19 infection, and insistent administration of anti-osteoporosis drugs during outbreaks; (2) home prevention for osteoporosis patients including keeping windows open, exposing them to sunlight, supplementing them with enough protein, exercising regularly, and administrating calcium supplements; and (3) simplifying the follow-up and evaluation of osteoporosis using online platforms.","Zou, J; Song, D-W; Niu, J-J; Shi, J-W; Yang, H-L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,250

These explanations may be local, explaining an individual recommendation, or global, explaining the recommender model in general. Despite their widespread use, there has been little investigation into the relative benefits of these two approaches. Do they provide the same benefits to users, or do they serve different purposes? We conducted a 30-participant exploratory study and a 30-participant controlled user study with a research-paper recommender system to analyze how providing participants local, global, or both explanations influences user understanding of system behavior. Our results provide evidence suggesting that both explanations are more helpful than either alone for explaining how to improve recommendations, yet both appeared less helpful than global alone for efficiency in identifying false positives and negatives.

311460,Globalization in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"During the COVID-19 global pandemic, Taiwan has been universally praised for its policy actions in preventing its initial outbreak there from Wuhan and for its strict measures in containing its communal spread locally. Memory of the SARS crisis played a major role, but people in Taiwan forget that SARS was initially considered a problem confined mostly to Hong Kong. Taiwanese did not seem urgently aware, until infections multiplied locally. Taiwan’s health authorities eventually adopted a draconian quarantine policy, but mainly as a political tactic to contain the widespread panic, as though the dam had suddenly burst. In retrospect, the extremity and internal contradictions of the policy are remarkable, but they are instructive. The initial reaction of unprepared governments, most notably in the US, during COVID-19 mirrors this same ineptitude. Enabling hysteria and resorting to scapegoating were in turn diversions to cover up their inability to prevent a crisis. In the US, racism emerged, China and the WHO were blamed, people were even urged not to wear masks to avoid a run on short supplies. This is the tip of the political iceberg, if one adds tightened immigration and economic effects on the U.S. elections.","Allen, Chun",Cultural Studies,,250

311786,Jewish ethics in COVID-19,2020,"BackgroundThe Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has gravely affected several aspects of national and global society, including education. Given the risk it poses, the Government of Uganda (GOU) adopted and recommended face mask use as one of the preventive measures to limit its transmission in communities. However, there is limited data on the levels of face mask usage and associated factors among students in schools in Uganda. This study aimed at assessing the face mask usage and associated factors among students in schools in rural Eastern Uganda amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA cross sectional quantitative descriptive study was conducted among 423 students in schools in rural Eastern Uganda. Multi-stage sampling method was employed in the selection of study participants. The data was collected by trained data collectors using structured questionnaires pre-installed on ODK enabled smart phones. The data entered was cleaned using Excel 2016 and exported to Stata14.0 statistical software (Statacorp, College station, Texas, USA) for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed using 95% CI (confidence interval). Variables with p-value < 0.20 and those with literature backup evidence were included in the multivariable model. Variables with p-value < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. This study revealed that less than three quarters (62.3%) wore face masks correctly. ResultsAlmost all, 98.9% of the participants mentioned that they wore face masks due to fear of missing classes and 49.0% disagreed that they were vulnerable to COVID-19. Students in boarding schools (AOR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.05-2.47), those who believed that they were vulnerable to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.11-2.10), and those who disagreed that masks are uncomfortable (AOR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.06-2.46) were more likely to wear facemasks correctly. ConclusionThis study revealed that more than a third of the students did not wear face masks correctly. Correct wearing of face masks was associated with being in a boarding school, belief that they were susceptible to COVID-19, and disagreeing that masks were uncomfortable. This therefore highlights the need for sensitization programmes in academic institutions in order to improve students perceptions toward COVID-19 and face masks, and consequently increase correct face mask usage in schools.","Mwesige, Denis; Nalugya, Aisha; Bulafu, Douglas; Tigaiza, Arnold; Nagawa, Bridget Tamale; Balinda, Emmanuel; Walekhwa, Abel Wilson",,,250
311787,Jewish Ethics in COVID-19,2020,"The capability of generalization to unseen domains is crucial for deep learning models when considering real-world scenarios. However, current available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this issue, we propose a prior knowledge driven domain adaptation and a dual-domain enhanced self-correction learning scheme. Based on the novel learning schemes, a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels. Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods. Ablation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in our model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and self-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to multi-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical deployment.","Jin, Qiangguo; Cui, Hui; Sun, Changming; Meng, Zhaopeng; Wei, Leyi; Su, Ran",Expert Syst Appl,,250

312366,Playing the Pandemic between newsgames and playful simulation,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore quarantined individuals' emotional well-being over time and how personal response and life activity predict emotional well-being and its change. DESIGN/METHODS: Daily data were collected from 134 participants with 71 having 14 consecutive days' data. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and General Linear Model (GLM) were used to examine the primary tests. RESULTS: Overall, positive and negative emotions declined significantly during the surveyed period. Meanwhile, differences were observed in the level of positive, depressed, and negative emotions and/or patterns of change among different population categories. The personal response of worrying about work and life was positively related to depressed and negative emotions at baseline, but was negatively related to the development of both depressed and negative emotions over time. Among life activities, family stressor was a significant predictor for both depressed and negative emotions while social support predicted positive emotions. Moreover, health & hygiene activity was positively related to positive emotions at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide scientific evidence for public health policymakers on quarantine policies and inform the general public about quarantine life. They highlight the importance of addressing the needs of vulnerable groups (parents with young children, divorcees, clinicians) during the pandemic, and demonstrate the benefits of promoting healthcare and hygiene activity, having a sense of worry and access to social support.","Ma, Shaozhuang; Zeng, Weilong; Borges, Andreia; Xu, Yiqing; Zhang, Jinrui",Psychol Health,,250

However, to our best knowledge, there is no in-depth report on the course of patients with COVID-19 complicated by relapsing viral conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old man confirmed with COVID-19 developed symptoms of viral conjunctivitis in the left eye approximately 10 days after the onset of COVID-19. The results of a nucleic acid test were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival sac of the left eye. The symptoms were relieved 6 days after treatment. However, the patient was subsequently diagnosed with viral keratoconjunctivitis in both eyes 5 days after the symptoms in the left eye were satisfactorily relieved. The disease progressed rapidly, with spot staining observed at the periphery of the corneal epithelium. Although SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in conjunctival secretions, the levels of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6, were increased in both eyes. Both eyes were treated with glucocorticoids, and symptoms were controlled within 5 days. There was no recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In this case report, the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and outcome of a case with COVID-19 complicated by relapsing viral keratoconjunctivitis is described, and the involvement of topical cytokine surge in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as it relates to viral keratoconjunctivitis is reported.","Guo, Dongyu; Xia, Jianhua; Wang, Yang; Zhang, Xuhong; Shen, Ye; Tong, Jian-Ping",Virol J,,250

Despite the existence of multiple studies on the different digestive symptoms and their relationship with this disease, it is still vital to highlight the severity of the different symptoms, the need to diagnose it properly and quickly. Currently in Colombia there are no writings that highlight the above. CASE PRESENTATION: This article reports the case of a 37-year-old female patient, with no important history, who consulted for 10 h of a generalized intense abdominal pain, of sudden onset, associated with multiple stools of diarrheal consistency, and no respiratory symptoms and no epidemiological exposure. Physical examination with intense pain in the colic frame with tenderness. It was decided to rule out surgical pathology and a CT scan was performed finding no evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology, but with a peripheral alveolar, and ground-glass opacities at lung bases, classic COVID-19 radiological pattern, confirmed by a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, leading to consider that the gastrointestinal symptoms were secondary to this infection. Symptomatic management was given with subsequent improvement. CONCLUSIONS: It is extremely important to present this first case report of a young female COVID-19 patient with an acute abdominal pain as the main clinical manifestation, that almost culminates in a surgical procedure; demonstrating the scope of gastrointestinal symptoms secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sierra-Arango, Fernando; Vergara-Cabra, Cathalina; Vásquez-Roldan, Mariana; Pérez-Riveros, Erika D",BMC Gastroenterol,,250
314114,Exploring the Parent-Child Landscape Pattern after COVID-19,2020,"This study explores how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Hong Kong can be considered as 'infomediaries' (UNDP, 2003) in their use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support resilience-building across a growing population of migrant domestic workers (MDWs). It also acknowledges MDWs effective existing self-organizing community networks, including religious groups and labour unions. This study maps how NGO infomediaries are currently supporting MDW communities. It posits that NGOs are uniquely capable of developing ICTs grounded in local legal, psychological, and cultural contexts to improve MDW community resilience. The study finds that the fragmented nature of technology use between NGO infomediaries and the competition between NGOs for funding hinders NGO infomediaries' ability to support building lasting resilience within the MDW community. Recommendations from this study seek to align NGO infomediary tool development more closely with the MDW community in Hong Kong's existing communicative ecologies. It considers NGOs as infomediaries capable of adapting and streamlining various linkages across grassroots MDW social organizations, local community leaders, and governments that impact the MDW community. This study is a tool for NGO infomediaries to understand the types of resilience networks that they are uniquely capable of building with MDWs in Hong Kong.","Zinser, Sophie; Thinyane, Hannah",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10095v1.pdf,250
314182,COVID-19: An Italian Hospital Response From the Nursing Perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 pandemic has affected various countries differently due to variance in demographics, income level, health infrastructure, government response, control and enforcement, and cultural traits of different populations. This study aims to identify significant factors behind the unequal distribution of identified cases and deaths in different countries. Our study's objective is comparative analysis and identification of relations between the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, population characteristics, and government response. METHODS: The top 18 countries worst hit by COVID-19 cases were identified. The data metrics, such as the number of cases, deaths, fatality rates, tests, average life expectancy, and population, were collected and consolidated. RESULTS: Countries with significant percentage of the older population are vulnerable to a high number of deaths due to COVID-19. Developed countries have higher per capita testing, whereas testing is less intensive in developing/underdeveloped countries. There is a consensus among health experts that COVID-19 has higher fatality rates for people above 60, however, with further age, this increases exponentially. Countries with higher life expectancy are also high-income countries, and the best course of action would be to provide specialized support to self-isolate for people of ages 75 and above. CONCLUSION: The behaviour of disease occurring at a large scale and interaction with different populations is studied to understand and differentiate the factors and measures that successfully inhibited the pandemic. The study benchmarks different countries based on their performance and efforts against the pandemic and provides some useful insights on the efficiency of their governance and potential to improve & ramp up their programs. The economic status and existing healthcare infrastructure as they are the key factors in determining the country's ability to contain and minimize the losses from this pandemic.","Shams, Shahbaz A; Haleem, Abid; Javaid, Mohd",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,250

A total of 72 patients who underwent color Doppler ultrasound examination in Liaocheng Third People's Hospital from March 2015 to August 2018 were collected as research subjects, and the blood of 60 healthy subjects who underwent physical examinations was collected. The expression level of MMP-11 in serum of breast cancer patients was evaluated, and the diagnostic value of color Doppler ultrasound combined with MMP-11 in breast cancer was assessed. The diagnostic results of color Doppler ultrasound and the imaging characteristics of breast cancer patients were recorded. The results of biopsy and ultrasound were compared. The expression level of MMP-11 in serum of breast cancer patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects (P<0.05). The AUC of MMP-11 was 0.735, the sensitivity was 66.67%, and the specificity was 86.11%. Among the 72 patients, there were 41 patients diagnosed with breast cancer by serum MMP-11 examination, 38 patients diagnosed by ultrasound examination, 33 patients diagnosed by combined diagnosis, and 30 patients diagnosed by pathology biopsy. The pathological biopsy was used as the gold standard. The diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound combined with mammography examination was significantly better than the other two single examinations (P<0.050). In conclusion, Doppler ultrasound parameters combined with MMP-11 has a high diagnostic accordance rate in the diagnosis of breast cancer. At the same time, different diagnostic methods combined with the clinical manifestations of patients can improve the diagnostic accuracy, which is worthy of providing reference and advice for future clinical practice.","Ren, Hui; Shen, Zhipeng; Shen, Jirui; Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Yunhua",Oncol Lett,,250
314206,"Reporting, Recording and Communication of COVID-19 Cases in Workplace: Data Protection as a Moving Target",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge to house officers training programs because of the safety measures. OBJECTIVE: This current study aimed to introduce the adaptation of family medicine training for house officers during COVID-19 pandemic and gauge their level of satisfaction with the training. METHODS: Unfortunately, more than one-fourth of the house officers attending the family medicine training turned out to be hospital-admitted or in obligatory home isolation. A time-sensitive plan was proposed to maintain a competent training guaranteeing safety and support of house officers and fulfilling the training objectives in a virtual setting. Three mentors were assigned to each 10 house officers to provide continuous support and monitoring. Tutor and house officer interaction and reflection were maintained through a virtual clinical training session via Zoom application and a daily online discussion of a clinical scenario. Peer interaction was provided through post-webinar and small-group online discussion sessions. RESULTS: The adapted training was applied on thirteen cohorts of house officers. The response rate was 70% (666 out of 950). Most of them were satisfied with the training (84.6%). Their satisfaction with each modality of the training was encouraging. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic, successful adaptation of family medicine training has succeeded in fulfilling the training objectives and providing psychological support and engagement for house officers without burdening the hospital-admitted and home-isolated house officers.","Ahmed, Marwa M; Fares, Samar; Sayed, Asmaa A; El Sayed, Inas T",J Prim Care Community Health,,250

314837,Lessons Learned and Experiences Shared From the Front Lines: Milan and Madrid,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic was officially declared on March 11th, 2020. Since the very beginning, the spread of the virus has been tracked nearly in real-time by worldwide genome sequencing efforts. As of March 2021, more than 830,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been uploaded in GISAID and this wealth of data allowed researchers to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during this first pandemic year. In parallel, nomenclatures systems, often with poor consistency among each other, have been developed to designate emerging viral lineages. Despite general fears that the virus might mutate to become more virulent or transmissible, SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has remained relatively low during the first ~ 8 months of sustained human-to-human transmission. At the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, though, some alarming events started to raise concerns of possible changes in the evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Specifically, three new viral variants associated with extensive transmission have been described as variants of concern (VOC). These variants were first reported in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). Their designation as VOCs was determined by an increase of local cases and by the high number of amino acid substitutions harboured by these lineages. This latter feature is reminiscent of viral sequences isolated from immunocompromised patients with long-term infection, suggesting a possible causal link. Here we review the events that led to the identification of these lineages, as well as emerging data concerning their possible implications for viral phenotypes, reinfection risk, vaccine efficiency and epidemic potential. Most of the available evidence is, to date, provisional, but still represents a starting point to uncover the potential threat posed by the VOCs. We also stress that genomic surveillance must be strengthened, especially in the wake of the vaccination campaigns.","González-Candelas, Fernando; Shaw, Marie-Anne; Phan, Tung; Kulkarni-Kale, Urmila; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Luciani, Fabio; Kimura, Hirokazu; Sironi, Manuela",Infect Genet Evol,,250

315626,Effects of COVID-19 on Indian Energy Consumption,2020,"BACKGROUND: Investigating antecedents of behaviors, such as wearing face coverings, is critical for developing strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine associations between theory-based behavioral predictors of intention to wear a face covering and actual wearing of a face covering in public. METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional panel survey of U.S. adults conducted in May and June 2020 (N = 1,004) were used to test a theory-based behavioral path model. We (a) examined predictors of intention to wear a face covering, (b) reported use of cloth face coverings, and (c) reported use of other face masks (e.g., a surgical mask or N95 respirator) in public. RESULTS: We found that being female, perceived importance of others wanting the respondent to wear a face covering, confidence to wear a face covering, and perceived importance of personal face covering use was positively associated with intention to wear a face covering in public. Intention to wear a face covering was positively associated with self-reported wearing of a cloth face covering if other people were observed wearing cloth face coverings in public at least ""rarely"" (aOR = 1.43), with stronger associations if they reported ""sometimes"" (aOR = 1.83), ""often"" (aOR = 2.32), or ""always"" (aOR = 2.96). For other types of face masks, a positive association between intention and behavior was only present when observing others wearing face masks ""often"" (aOR = 1.25) or ""always"" (aOR = 1.48). CONCLUSIONS: Intention to wear face coverings and observing other people wearing them are important behavioral predictors of adherence to the CDC recommendation to wear face coverings in public.","Barile, John P; Guerin, Rebecca J; Fisher, Kiva A; Tian, Lin H; Okun, Andrea H; Vanden Esschert, Kayla L; Jeffers, Alexiss; Gurbaxani, Brian M; Thompson, William W; Prue, Christine E",Ann. behav. med,,250

316123,Covid-19 in Russia: Novels of Legal Regulation of Healthcare,2020,"Cryoablation is an emerging type of treatment for cancer. The sensitization of tumors using cryosensitizing agents prior to treatment enhances ablation efficiency and may improve clinical outcomes. Water efflux, which is regulated by aquaporin channels, contributes to cancer cell damage achieved through cryoablation. An increase in aquaporin (AQP) 3 is cryoprotective, whereas its inhibition augments cryodamage. The present study aimed to investigate aquaporin (AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5) gene expression and cellular localization in response to cryoinjury. Cultured breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) were exposed to freezing to induce cryoinjury. RNA and protein extracts were then analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. Localization of aquaporins was studied using immunocytochemistry. Additionally, cells were transfected with small interfering RNA to silence aquaporin gene expression and cell viability was assessed using the Sulforhodamine B assay. Cryoinjury did not influence gene expression of AQPs, except for a 4-fold increase of AQP1 expression in MDA-MD-231 cells. There were no clear differences in AQP protein expression for either cell lines upon exposure to frozen and non-frozen temperatures, with the exception of fainter AQP5 bands for non-frozen MCF-7 cells. The exposure of cancer cells to freezing temperatures altered the localization of AQP1 and AQP3 proteins in both MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231 cells. The silencing of AQP1, AQP3 and AQP5 exacerbated MDA-MD-231 cell damage associated with freezing compared with control siRNA. This was also observed with AQP3 and AQP5 silencing in MCF-7 cells. Inhibition of aquaporins may potentially enhance cryoinjury. This cryosensitizing process may be used as an adjunct to breast cancer cryotherapy, especially in the border area targeted by cryoablation where freezing temperatures are not cold enough to induce cellular damage.","Alkhalifa, Haifa Mohammed Fatima Taurin Sebastien Greish Khaled Taha Safa Fredericks Salim",Oncology Letters,,250
316161,Cure models to estimate time until hospitalization due to COVID-19,2021,"AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the interobserver variability of intensive care unit (ICU) practitioners and radiologists who used the M-BLUE (modified bedside lung ultrasound in emergency) protocol to assess coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients, and to determine the correlation between total M-BLUE protocol score and three different scoring systems reflecting disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was not required. Ninety-six lung ultrasonography (LUS) examinations were performed using the M-BLUE protocol in 79 consecutive COVID-19 patients. Two ICU practitioners and three radiologists reviewed video clips of the LUS of eight different regions in each lung retrospectively. Each observer, who was blind to the patient information, described each clip with M-BLUE terminology and assigned a corresponding score. Interobserver variability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis (R-value) was used to assess the correlation between the total score of the eight video clips and disease severity. RESULTS: For different LUS signs, fair to good agreement was obtained (ICC = 0.601, 0.339, 0.334, and 0.557 for 0-3 points respectively). The overall interobserver variability was good for both the five different readers and consensus opinions (ICC = 0.618 and 0.607, respectively). There were good correlations between total LUS score and scores from three systems reflecting disease severity (R=0.394-0.660, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, interobserver agreement for different signs and total scores in LUS is good and justifies its use in patients with COVID-19. The total scores of LUS are useful to indicate disease severity.","Xue, H; Li, C; Cui, L; Tian, C; Li, S; Wang, Z; Liu, C; Ge, Q",Clin Radiol,,250

Continuous cardiac monitoring has been recommended for any COVID-19 patient with a Tisdale Score of seven or more. This recommendation, however, has not been validated. METHODS: We included 178 COVID-19 patients admitted to a non-intensive care unit setting of a tertiary academic medical center. A receiver operating characteristics curve was plotted to determine the accuracy of the Tisdale Score to predict QT interval prolongation. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify additional predictors. RESULTS: The area under the curve of the Tisdale Score was 0.60 (CI 95%, 0.46-0.75). Using the cutoff of seven to stratify COVID-19, patients had a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 7.6%. Risk factors independently associated with QT interval prolongation included a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (OR, 6.42; CI 95%, 1.28-32.13), QTc &#8805;450 ms on admission (OR, 5.90; CI 95%, 1.62-21.50), and serum potassium &#8804;3.5 mmol/L during hospitalization (OR, 4.97; CI 95%, 1.51-16.36). CONCLUSION: The Tisdale Score is not a useful tool to stratify hospitalized non-critical COVID-19 patients based on their risks of developing QT interval prolongation. Clinicians should initiate continuous cardiac monitoring for patients who present with a history of ESRD, QTc &#8805;450 ms on admission or serum potassium &#8804;3.5 mmol/L.","Zhao, Wei; Gandhi, Nikhil; Affas, Saif; Szpunar, Susan; Mesiha, Nancy; Saravolatz, Louis",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,,250

319235,Market Efficiency of ESG and Traditional Indices -Pre and Post COVID Analysis of NSE Indices (preprint),2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between infection with SARS-CoV-2 and autoimmunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although most of the infected individuals are asymptomatic, a proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease with multiple organ injuries. Evidence suggests that some medications used to treat autoimmune rheumatologic diseases might have therapeutic effect in patients with severe COVID-19 infections, drawing attention to the relationship between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. COVID-19 shares similarities with autoimmune diseases in clinical manifestations, immune responses and pathogenic mechanisms. Robust immune reactions participate in the pathogenesis of both disease conditions. Autoantibodies as a hallmark of autoimmune diseases can also be detected in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some patients have been reported to develop autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain--Barré syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, after COVID-19 infection. It is speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can disturb self-tolerance and trigger autoimmune responses through cross-reactivity with host cells. The infection risk and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune diseases remains controversial, but patient adherence to medication regimens to prevent autoimmune disease flares is strongly recommended. SUMMARY: We present a review of the association between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases, focusing on similarities in immune responses, cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2, the development of autoimmune diseases in COVID-19 patients and the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with preexisting autoimmune conditions.","Liu, Yu; Sawalha, Amr H; Lu, Qianjin",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,250
319359,Gender Gaps within Couples: Evidence of Time Re-allocations during COVID-19 in Argentina,2021,"BackgroundAlthough the Czech Republic weathered the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic with relatively low incidence, the second wave of the global pandemic saw it rank among countries bearing the greatest COVID-19 burden, both in Europe and on a worldwide scale. The aim of the nationwide prospective seroconversion (PROSECO) study was to investigate the dynamics of seroconversion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the Czech population. MethodsAll clients of the second largest health insurance company in the Czech Republic were sent a written invitation to participate in this longitudinal study. The study includes the first 30,054 persons who provided a blood sample between October 2020 and March 2021. Seroprevalence was compared between calendar periods of blood sample collection, RT-PCR test results, sociodemographic factors, and other characteristics. FindingsThe data show a dramatic increase in seropositivity over time, from 28% in October/November 2020 to 43% in December 2020/January 2021 to 51% in February/March 2021. These trends were consistent with government data on cumulative viral antigenic prevalence in the population captured by PCR testing - although the seroprevalence rates established in this study were considerably higher than those listed in government data. Data pooled across the entire study period exhibited minor differences in seropositivity between sexes, age groups and body mass index categories; results were similar between test providing laboratories. Seropositivity was substantially higher among symptomatic vs. asymptomatic persons (76% vs. 34%). At least one third of all seropositive participants were asymptomatic, and 28% participants who developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 never underwent PCR testing. InterpretationAntibody response provides a better marker of past SARS-CoV-2 infection than PCR testing data. Our data on seroconversion confirm the rapidly increasing prevalence in the Czech population during the dramatically rising pandemic wave prior to the beginning of massive vaccination. The planned second and third assessment of the study participants (April 2021 - September 2021, October 2021 - March 2022) will provide valuable evidence on the seroprevalence changes following vaccination and persistence of antibodies resulting from natural infection and vaccination. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSimilarly to most European countries, the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in the Czech Republic produced a relatively low incidence (86.9 confirmed cases per 100,000 persons over three months). At the peaks of the second wave, however, over 100 confirmed cases per 100,000 persons were diagnosed daily and the Czech Republic ranked among the countries with the greatest burden of COVID-19 in Europe and in the world. Only a few nationwide population-based studies have been published covering the second wave of the epidemic in Europe, and none of them from the Central and Eastern European region. Added value of this studyThe PROSECO study will provide key data from the heavily affected Central European region and contribute to the epidemiological and serological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. All 30,054 study participants were recruited between October 2020 and March 2021, thus covering all three epidemic peaks (November 2020, January and March 2021) of the second COVID-19 epidemic wave. This allows us to follow the dynamics of seroconversion of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the immunologically naive and unvaccinated population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study participants will be re-assessed in the second (April 2021 - September 2021) and third (October 2021 - March 2022) PROSECO phases to further study the post-infection/post-vaccination dynamics of seroconversion in/after a period of massive vaccination. Implications of all the available evidenceData from the first phase of the PROSECO study indicate that the percentage of the population that has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 may be substantially higher than estimates based on official data on cumulative viral positivity incidence as at least one third of seropositive participants were asymptomatic, and 28% of participants who developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 never underwent PCR testing. Regional seroprevalence data provide key information to inform, in combination with other surveillance data, public health policies and will be instrumental for the successful management of the subsequent phases of the global pandemic. The number of seropositive participants who never underwent RT-PCR testing demonstrates the importance of serological population-based studies describing the spread and exposure to the virus in the population over time.","Piler, Pavel; Thon, Vojtech; Andryskova, Lenka; Dolezel, Kamil; Kostka, David; Pavlik, Tomas; Dusek, Ladislav; Pikhart, Hynek; Bobak, Martin; Klanova, Jana",,,250

Adapting neuropsychology services using teleneuropsychology models (e.g. video or telephone assessments) may not always be a viable option for all providers and settings. Based on the existing teleneuropsychology literature, we propose a ""contactless"" evidence-based inpatient test battery to be used for in-person assessments amenable to physical distancing. Method: In addition to the proposed test battery, we suggest a decision-making workflow process to help readers determine the appropriateness of the proposed methods given their patients' needs. Considerations for special populations (i.e. seniors, patients with brain injury, psychiatric patients), feedback, limitations of the proposed physical distancing approach, and future directions are also discussed. Conclusions: Our aim is that the suggested teleneuropsychology-informed battery and model may inform safe and practical neuropsychological inpatient assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic and other situations requiring contact precautions for infection prevention and control.","Parlar, Melissa E; Spilka, Michael J; Wong Gonzalez, Daniela; Ballantyne, Elena C; Dool, Catherine; Gojmerac, Christina; King, Jelena; McNeely, Heather; MacKillop, Emily",Clin Neuropsychol,,250

324628,Validate the integrity of research data on COVID 19,2020,"The coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become the largest global public health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, consisting of 2148 COVID-19 cases and 1182 CAP cases from five hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed method. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.","Di, Donglin; Shi, Feng; Yan, Fuhua; Xia, Liming; Mo, Zhanhao; Ding, Zhongxiang; Shan, Fei; Song, Bin; Li, Shengrui; Wei, Ying; Shao, Ying; Han, Miaofei; Gao, Yaozong; Sui, He; Gao, Yue; Shen, Dinggang",Med Image Anal,,250

The aim of this study was to describe specific clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with a history of stroke. METHODS: All the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were included in our cohort study. Clinical data were analyzed and compared between patients with and without a history of stroke. RESULTS: Of the included 1875 patients with COVID-19, 50 patients had a history of stroke. The COVID-19 patients with medical history of stroke were older with more comorbidities, had higher neutrophil count, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts than those without history of stroke. The levels of D-dimers, cardiac troponin I, NT pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and interleukin-6 were also markedly higher in patients with history of stroke. Stroke survivors who underwent COVID-19 developed more acute respiratory distress syndrome and received more noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Data from propensity-matched analysis indicated a higher proportion of patients with COVD-19 with a history of stroke were admitted to the intensive care unit requiring mechanical ventilation and were more likely to be held in the unit or die, compared with non-stroke history COVID-19 patients.

Several of these antibodies are directed against NMDA receptors (NMDAR), mostly in autoimmune encephalitis, whereas a growing field of research has identified antibodies against AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits in patients with different types of epilepsy or frontotemporal dementia. Several in vitro and in vivo studies performed in the last decade have dramatically improved our understanding of the molecular and functional effects induced by both NMDAR and AMPAR autoantibodies at the excitatory glutamatergic synapse and, consequently, their possible role in the onset of clinical symptoms. In particular, the method by which autoantibodies can modulate the localization at synapses of specific target subunits leading to functional impairments and behavioral alterations has been well addressed in animal studies. Overall, these preclinical studies have opened new avenues for the development of novel pharmacological treatments specifically targeting the synaptic activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors.","Gardoni, Fabrizio; Stanic, Jennifer; Scheggia, Diego; Benussi, Alberto; Borroni, Barbara; Di Luca, Monica",,,250

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study consisted of an Institutional Review Board-approved single-institution retrospective analysis of NET patients who received transarterial chemoembolization from 2006 to 2016 and TARE from 2005 to 2014 and survived at least 1 year from the initial treatment. Patients receiving only transarterial chemoembolization (n = 63) or TARE (n = 28) were evaluated for the presence or absence of durable hepatic toxicities occurring at least 6 months after initial treatment. The definitions and grades of liver injury were adapted from Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and were characterized by the presence of laboratory or clinical toxicities of Grade 3 or above. RESULTS: Chronic hepatic toxicity occurred in 14 of 63 transarterial chemoembolization patients (22%) with a total of 26 Grade 3-4 events, in whom elevation of bilirubin was the most common toxicity, compared to 8 of 28 TARE patients (29%) with a total of 16 Grade 3-4 and 2 Grade 5 events, in whom ascites were the most frequent toxicity. There were more laboratory toxicities in the transarterial chemoembolization group (65% vs 38%, P = .11) and fewer Grade 4-5 injuries (6% vs 27% of patients, P = .06). There was also a significantly higher number of patients who experienced intrahepatic progression of disease in the transarterial chemoembolization cohort than in the TARE patients (75% vs 43%, respectively; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed hepatotoxicity from transarterial chemoembolization and TARE occurred in 22% and 29% of patients, respectively, from 6 months to several years following treatment. Transarterial chemoembolization-related toxicities on average were less severe and manifested primarily as laboratory derangements, compared to TARE toxicities which consisted of clinical hepatic decompensation.","Currie, Brian M; Nadolski, Gregory; Mondschein, Jeffrey; Dagli, Mandeep; Sudheendra, Deepak; Stavropoulos, S William; Soulen, Michael C",J Vasc Interv Radiol,,250

The obtained data show a trend towards consumption of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, and a decrease in less healthy ones such as processed foods. In total, 46 % of the population reported they were eating more than before the confinement, with an increase in snacking between meals (54 %) and in anxiety about food due to situations of stress or nervousness bieng reported by 40 % of respondents. This has resulted in an increase in body weight, reported by 44 % of participants, with the average gain being 2.8 ± 1.5 kg. CONCLUSIONS: during confinement, the eating and lifestyle habits of the Galician population have been modified. The weight gain observed in a population that already had a high level of overweight and obesity at confinement onset aggravates the present situation and may have a negative impact on the development of chronic, non-communicable.","Sinisterra Loaiza, Laura Isabel; Vázquez Belda, Beatriz; Miranda López, José Manuel; Cepeda, Alberto; Cardelle Cobas, Alejandra",Nutr. hosp,,250

327430,Lockdown timing and efficacy in controlling COVID-19 using mobile phone tracking,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched limited public health resources beyond measures, particularly at the local level. What started as an interesting report of pneumonia of unknown etiology in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, bloomed into an international crisis by mid-January 2020. However, it was not until late January, when the first case was reported in the United States, that a new reality took shape for US public health agencies. After all, severe acute respiratory syndrome never made it to this country, and the only 2 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome here were imported and never spread. Local public health agencies are notoriously short-staffed and underfunded. Therefore, when a crisis looms, personnel from a multitude of areas within the agencies are called upon to help out. Under its innovative and forward-thinking leadership, the St. Louis County Department of Health internally implemented the Incident Command System, a component of the National Incident Management System. While reassignment of individuals to new responsibilities under a new and temporary reporting structure did not always go perfectly, ICS kept its promise to be adaptable to a fast-evolving situation, to clearly outline needed areas of responsibility, and to provide scaffolding that kept the Department of Health functional in chaotic times. It was able to be implemented quickly within hours of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in St. Louis County and enhanced the quality and timeliness of the public health response. This experience is being shared to provide a model of how organizations with limited personnel can use the Incident Command System to reorganize and meet unexpected challenges with increased success.","Baskin, Carole R; Barry, Mark; Cohen, Rachel E; Condren, Colleen; Crosley, Sarah; Dickhans, Carrie D; Donaldson, Kate; Gardner, Sharon; Griffin, Ken J A; Place, Arletta; Doucette, Emily D; Schmidt, Spring",Health Secur,,250

Elearning is the concept of education that has begun to be widely implemented at this covid-19 pandemic to avoid the spread of transmission through social distancing. One of elearning types is essay but for large participants, it need much effort for evaluate by human rater. The inconsistency of assessment by the rater due to fatigue can also affect the quality of the assessment. Developing a system that can learn and understand on its own without having to be repeatedly programmed by humans used machine learning and computational linguistics to study the interaction between computers and human natural language used natural language processing proposed in this research. Natural language processing and text mining methods are able to provide a good assessment which is influenced by several processes, namely tokenization, stopword, stemming and support with the number of keywords, and the synonym of more complex keywords. The automated essay scoring system is proven to provide consistent and objective assessments and is able to approach human raters assessments.","Gunawansyah, Rahayu R.; Nurwathi, Sugiarto B.; Gunawan, Ieee","Proceeding of 14th International Conference on Telecommunication Systems, Services, and Applications",,250
328001,Graph based Clustering Algorithm for Social Community Transmission Prediction of COVID-19,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND: Nurses, as the largest group of health professionals, are at the frontline of the healthcare system in response to COVID-19 epidemic. This study aimed to evaluate the nurses' certainty and satisfaction with medical gloves when exposed to coronavirus in Fars province, south of Iran. METHODS: Using convenience sampling, 400 hospital nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak were selected from eight hospitals of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS). A questionnaire about glove reliability, including protection in tasks, durability, integrity and tear resistance, feeling fearful, and focusing on duties, and the nurses' anxiety regarding their infection with coronavirus was distributed to the selected nurses to complete. 375 questionnaires were completed (response rate of 93.75%). Among the participants, 180 (48%) were in the corona section and 195 (52%) were hardly possible to have contact with coronavirus pneumonia patients. RESULTS: The mean score (SD) of anxiety about infection with COVID-19 for nurses in the COVID-19 section and those in the non-COVID-19 section were 6.08 (2.8) and 4.56 (2.58), respectively (p<0.05). The mean duration of gloves usage in a day was almost similar in the two groups (about 5h), but the number of glove replacements was significantly higher among the nurses in the corona section (6 times) compared to those in the non-corona section (3 times). The two groups were also significantly different regarding glove protection in daily tasks and glove durability. CONCLUSION: The nurses in the corona section had more concerns about medical gloves as a type of personal protective equipment. In addition to health education on controlling and preventing the spread of diseases, raising awareness about the reliability of personal protective equipment can improve nurses' performance.","Jahangiri, M; Malakoutikhah, M; Choobineh, A; Zare, A",J. healthc. qual. res,,250

SettingThis study was embedded within the Rhineland Study, an ongoing community-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany DesignCross-sectional nested case-control study. ParticipantsParticipants were selected based on results from a previously conducted seroprevalence survey within the framework of the Rhineland Study. Cases were defined as those individuals who had had two positive confirmatory test results, including a recombinant spike-based immunofluorescence assay and a plaque reduction neutralization test (N=21). As controls, a random sample of individuals with a negative ELISA test result (Controls I, N=1117), and those with a borderline or positive ELISA test result who failed confirmatory testing (Controls II, N=68), were selected. Outcome measuresPlasma levels of NfL at the time of measurement, as well as change in plasma NfL levels compared to previously measured pre-pandemic levels ResultsAfter adjustment for age, sex and batch effects, serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was neither associated with cross-sectional NfL levels, nor with the magnitude of change from pre-pandemic levels, compared to either of the two control groups. Similarly, after adjustment for age, sex and batch effects, self-reported neurological symptoms - including altered sense of smell or taste, headache, myalgia and fever - were not associated with changes in NfL levels in participants with a serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (all p [≥] 0.56). ConclusionsOur findings indicate that mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 is unlikely to be associated with a clinically relevant degree of neuroaxonal damage, even in those cases associated with neurological symptoms.","Aziz, N.

328864,Joint Statement on Data Protection and Privacy in the Covid-19 Response,2020,"Two devastating pandemics, the Spanish Flu and COVID-19, emerged globally in 1918 from America and 2019 from China, respectively. Influenza virus A H1N1, which caused Spanish Flu and SARS-CoV2, which caused COVID-19, belong to different virus family and bear different structure, genomic organization and pathogenicity. However, the trajectory of the current outbreak of COVID-19 depicts a similar picture of the Spanish Flu outbreak. Estimates suggest that ~500 million infected cases and ~50 million deaths occurred globally from 1918-1919 due to the H1N1 virus. While SARS-CoV2 accounted for ~2 million cases and 130, 885 deaths just within three and a half months, and the number is still increasing. To contain the spread of COVID-19 and to prevent the situation which happened a century back, it becomes essential to examine and correlate these pandemics in terms of their origin, epidemiology and clinical scenario. The strategies tailored to control the Spanish Flu pandemic may help to contain the current pandemic within time.","Agrawal, A.; Gindodiya, A.; Deo, K.; Kashikar, S.; Fulzele, P.; Khatib, N.",Open Public Health Journal,,250

However, they all need to keep on being evaluated in clinical trials. The WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group on the Next Steps for Covid-19 Vaccine suggested that countries with limited or no access to an effective vaccine could ethically permit placebo-controlled trials, even if effective vaccines were already being marketed elsewhere. Here, I argue that inclusion in a placebo-controlled trial is ethically sound for those who would be in any case ineligible for vaccination outside the trial, and as long as the access to the vaccine outside the trial depends on a transparent and just allocation framework. Conversely, carrying out placebo-controlled studies in countries where vaccines are not (or are insufficiently) available because of unequal global allocation, would be unethical, as an ethical strategy cannot be built on an unethical premise.","Ravinetto, Raffaella",Indian J Med Ethics,,250

AIMS: To examine the experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and loneliness and use of social media among people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. METHODS: A cross-country comparative survey of people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. Relevant statistical analyses were used to examine differences between the countries and to explore associations between demographic, mental health and psychosocial variables and use of social media. RESULTS: There were 3810 respondents from four countries, of which 50 - 74% showed a high level of emotional distress. The Norwegian population reported significantly better mental health, QoL and wellbeing and lower levels of loneliness compared to the other countries. High-frequent use of social media after the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with poorer mental- and psychosocial health. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak took a toll on people's experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and experienced loneliness, and high-frequent use of social media was associated with these factors.","Geirdal, Amy Østertun; Ruffolo, Mary; Leung, Janni; Thygesen, Hilde; Price, Daicia; Bonsaksen, Tore; Schoultz, Mariyana",J Ment Health,,250
331223,The possibility and importance of immersive technologies during COVID-19 for autistic people,2020,"Background: Italy's severe COVID-19 outbreak was addressed by a lockdown that gradually increased in space, time and intensity. The effectiveness of the lockdown has not been precisely assessed with respect to the intensity of mobility restriction and the time until the outbreak receded. Methods: We used processed mobile phone tracking data to measure mobility restriction, and related those data to the number of new SARS-CoV-2 positive cases detected on a daily base in the three most affected Italian regions, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, from February 1 through April 6, 2020, when two subsequent lockdowns with increasing intensity were implemented by the Italian government. Findings: During the study period, mobility restriction was inversely related to the daily number of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases only after the second, more effective lockdown, with a peak in the curve of diagnosed cases of infection occurring 14 to 18 days from lockdown in the three regions and 9 to 25 days in the included provinces. An effective reduction in transmission must have occurred nearly immediately after the tighter lockdown, given the lag time of around 10 days from asymptomatic infection to diagnosis. The period from lockdown to peak was shorter in the areas with the highest prevalence of the infection. This effect was seen within slightly more than one week in the most severely affected areas. Interpretation: It appears that the less rigid lockdown led to an insufficient decrease in mobility to reverse an outbreak such as COVID-19. With a tighter lockdown, mobility decreased enough to bring down transmission promptly below the level needed to sustain the epidemic. Funding: No funding sources have been used for this work.","Vinceti, Marco; Filippini, Tommaso; Rothman, Kenneth J; Ferrari, Fabrizio; Goffi, Alessia; Maffeis, Giuseppe; Orsini, Nicola",EClinicalMedicine,,250
331382,Social Entrepreneurship and COVID-19,2020,"In the midst of pandemic for respiratory illness, the call for non-pharmaceutical interventions become the highest priority for infectious disease and public health experts, while the race towards vaccine or medical intervention are ongoing. Individuals may modify their behavior and take preventative steps to reduce infection risk in the bid to adhere to the call by government officials and experts. As a result, the existence of relationship between the preliminary and the final transmission rates become feeble. This study evaluates the behavioral changes (mitigation and suppression measures) proposed by public health experts for COVID-19 which had altered human behavior and their day to day lives. The dynamics underlying the mitigation and suppression measures reduces the contacts among citizens and significantly interfere with their physical and social behavior. The results show all the measures have a significant impact on the decline of transmission rate. However, the mitigation measures might prolong the elimination of the transmission which might lead to a severe economic meltdown, yet, a combination of the measures show a possibility of rooting out transmission within 30 days if adhered to in an extreme manner. The result shows a peak period of infection for Ghana ranges from 64th day to 74th day of infection time period.","Nimako-Aidoo, Emmanuel de-Graft Johnson Owusu-Ansah Atinuke O.

332032,How the COVID-19 response is altering the legal and regulatory landscape on abortion,2020,"Cyanobacteria are found in most illuminated environments and are key players in global carbon and nitrogen cycling. Although significant efforts have been made to advance our understanding of this important phylum, still little is known about how members of the cyanobacteria affect and respond to changes in complex biological systems. This lack of knowledge is in part due to our dependence on pure cultures when determining the metabolism and function of a microorganism. We took advantage of the Culture Collection of Microorganisms from Extreme Environments (CCMEE), a collection of more than 1,000 publicly available photosynthetic co-cultures maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and assessed via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing if samples readily available from public culture collection could be used in the future to generate new insights into the role of microbial communities in global and local carbon and nitrogen cycling. Results from this work support the existing notion that culture depositories in general hold the potential to advance fundamental and applied research. Although it remains to be seen if co-cultures can be used at large scale to infer roles of individual organisms, samples that are publicly available from existing co-cultures depositories, such as the CCMEE, might be an economical starting point for such studies. Access to archived biological samples, without the need for costly field work, might in some circumstances be one of the few remaining ways to advance the field and to generate new insights into the biology of ecosystems that are not easily accessible. The current COVID-19 pandemic, which makes sampling expeditions almost impossible without putting the health of the participating scientists on the line, is a very timely example.","Shaw, Claire; Brooke, Charles; Hawley, Erik; Connolly, Morgan P; Garcia, Javier A; Harmon-Smith, Miranda; Shapiro, Nicole; Barton, Michael; Tringe, Susannah G; Glavina Del Rio, Tijana; Culley, David E; Castenholz, Richard; Hess, Matthias",Front Microbiol,,250

333468,Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak,2020,"Professional and tertiary health professions education (HPE) has been markedly challenged by the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Mandates for training organisations to reduce social contact during the global pandemic, and make learning available online, provide an opportunity for regional, rural and remote clinicians and students to more easily access learning and professional development opportunities. Online lectures, while posing an opportunity for regional, rural and remote HPE, entail potential risks. Educators who are familiar with face-to-face pedagogies may find a transition to remote, digital interaction unfamiliar, disarming, and therefore they may not design maximally engaging lectures. The strategies used in a face-to-face lecture cannot be directly transferred into the online environment. This article proposes strategies to ensure the ongoing effectiveness, efficiency and engagement of lectures transitioning from face-to-face to online delivery. Cognitive learning theory, strategies to promote learner engagement and minimise distraction, and examples of software affordances to support active learning during the lecture are proposed. This enables lecturers to navigate the challenges of lecturing in an online environment and plan fruitful online lectures during this disruptive time. These suggestions will therefore enable HPE to better meet the existing and future needs of regional, rural and remote learners who may not be able to easily access face-to-face learning upon the relaxation of social distancing measures. Strategies to provide equitable HPE to learners who cannot access plentiful, fast internet are also discussed.","Seymour-Walsh, Amy E; Weber, Anthony; Bell, Andy",Rural Remote Health,,250

334017,What We Can Learn from Environmental and Outdoor Education during COVID-19: A Lesson in Participatory Risk Management,2020,"Risk perceptions and trusted sources of information may have influenced consumer food handling practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used a mixed-method qualitative-quantitative approach to assess consumer risk perception and trusted sources of food safety information during the pandemic. From April to August of 2020, five waves of online surveys (N = 3,584, with a minimum of 700 per month) were distributed to a U.S. consumer panel, which included only primary food preparers and grocery shoppers. The online focus groups recruited participants (N = 43) from the first wave of survey respondents and were conducted via Webex from May to July 2020. Topics covered in both studies focused on food safety risk perceptions and trusted sources of information during the pandemic. Trusted sources of information included government agencies, healthcare professionals, scientists, and social media. Throughout the longitudinal study, survey respondents and focus group participants perceived a higher risk of getting COVID-19 from people than from food. Survey respondents believed that handwashing could protect them more from COVID-19 than from foodborne illnesses. Many focus group participants practiced handwashing to prevent them from contracting COVID-19 from food items. Both survey respondents and focus group participants trusted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and healthcare professionals for COVID-19 and food safety information. Focus group participants trusted these entities because they provide information that is “scientifically proven.” Survey data for all five months reported social media to be the least-trusted source of both COVID-19 and food safety information. Focus group participants agreed that social media has “misinformation.” The findings suggest that increased risk perception may have caused consumers to adopt good hand hygiene. However, consumers may not be connecting such practices to food safety. Food safety educators can use this time of heightened risk perception to connect COVID-19 and food safety practices. Trusted entities of information also need to be aware of their impact on consumer behavior and provide consumers with proper food safety information.","Thomas, Merlyn S.; Feng, Yaohua",Food Control,,250
334027,Risk of long QT syndrome in novel coronavirus COVID-19,2020,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities across the globe, the need to contain the spread of the outbreaks is of paramount importance. Wastewater monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent responsible for COVID-19, has emerged as a promising tool for health officials to anticipate outbreaks. As interest in wastewater monitoring continues to grow and municipalities begin to implement this approach, there is a need to further identify and evaluate methods used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA from wastewater samples. Here we evaluate the recovery, cost, and throughput of five different concentration methods for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in wastewater samples. We tested the five methods on six different wastewater samples. We also evaluated the use of a bovine coronavirus vaccine as a process control and pepper mild mottle virus as a normalization factor. Of the five methods we tested head-to-head, we found that HA filtration with bead beating performed the best in terms of sensitivity and cost. This evaluation can serve as a guide for laboratories establishing a protocol to perform wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2.","LaTurner, Zachary W; Zong, David M; Kalvapalle, Prashant; Gamas, Kiara Reyes; Terwilliger, Austen; Crosby, Tessa; Ali, Priyanka; Avadhanula, Vasanthi; Santos, Haroldo Hernandez; Weesner, Kyle; Hopkins, Loren; Piedra, Pedro A; Maresso, Anthony W; Stadler, Lauren B",Water Res,,250
334120,Facilitating Access to Multilingual COVID-19 Information via Neural Machine Translation,2020-05-01,"Social isolation in community-dwelling older adults with dementia is a growing health issue that can negatively affect health and well-being. To date, little attention has been paid to the role of technology in improving their social participation. This systematic review aims to provide a systematic overview of the effects of technological interventions that target social participation in community-dwelling older adults with and without dementia. The scientific databases Medline (PubMed), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched and independently screened by two reviewers. Results were synthesized narratively. The methodological quality of included studies was independently assessed by two reviewers. In total, 36 studies of varying methodological quality were identified. Most studies evaluated social networking technology and ICT training programs. Three studies focused on people with dementia. Quantitative findings showed limited effects on loneliness, social isolation, and social support. Nevertheless, several benefits related to social participation were reported qualitatively. Social interaction, face-to-face contact, and intergenerational engagement were suggested to be successful elements of technological interventions in improving the social participation of community-dwelling older adults. Rigorous studies with larger sample sizes are highly needed to evaluate the long-term effects of technology on the multidimensional concept of social participation.","Heins, Pascale Boots Lizzy M.

BACKGROUND: Factors affecting the recruitment and retention of suitable care workers in aged care are complex and influenced by personal, institutional and societal factors. METHODS: A qualitative description study design. RESULTS: In total, 32 staff participated in the study. Five main themes were identified: entering aged care with a passion for the job; entering aged care as it is the only employment option; factors attracting care workers to stay in aged care; factors influencing care workers to leave the job; and preferring to work in residential aged care rather than community aged care. CONCLUSION: Issues relating to the attraction and retention of aged care workers are influenced by personal, institutional and societal factors. Critical shortages in the aged care workforce make the industry more susceptible to crises such as COVID-19 outbreaks. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Aged care organizations need to create a positive psychosocial work environment for staff to improve the attraction and retention of skilled care workers. They also need to develop staff recruitment guidelines to ensure care workers with the appropriate skills and training and a passion for working with older adults are selected. Staff development programmes need to focus on learning activities that enable staff to build peers support in the work environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: There is a need to mandate curriculum to enable nursing students to receive more gerontological education and exposure to aged care throughout their education. Aged care quality standards need to mandate transition support for new graduate nurses.","Xiao, Lily Dongxia; Harrington, Ann; Mavromaras, Kostas; Ratcliffe, Julie; Mahuteau, Stephane; Isherwood, Linda; Gregoric, Carolyn",Int. nurs. rev,,250

To this purpose, we use time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) approach during the period from 02 January 2020 to 17 April 2020, while distinguishing between two sub-periods: before and after the announcement of the pandemic. The results show that the returns of both European renewable energy index and major precious metals (Gold, Silver, and Platinum) have increased after the announcement of the pandemic. However, except Soybean, the agriculture commodities (Corn and Wheat) did not respond to Covid-19 shocks during the same period. Moreover, our findings reveal that the renewable energy is the most volatile market, yet the agriculture industry is the least volatile. These results support the safe haven capability of Gold and suggest the hedging ability of some precious metals and agriculture commodities in periods of the pandemic. However, the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on renewable energy and commodity markets are expected to persist in the long term. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ghabri, Y.; Ayadi, A.",Lecture Notes in Energy,,250
336333,Democracy in times of the pandemic: explaining the variation of COVID-19 policies across European democracies,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the U.S. healthcare landscape. Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact. In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19. We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual. Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers. Notable benefits have included robust clinical volumes despite social distancing mandates, reduced logistical barrieres to care for many patients, and decreased no-show rates. Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future.","Chen, Justin A; Chung, Wei-Jean; Young, Sarah K; Tuttle, Margaret C; Collins, Michelle B; Darghouth, Sarah L; Longley, Regina; Levy, Raymond; Razafsha, Mahdi; Kerner, Jeffrey C; Wozniak, Janet; Huffman, Jeff C",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,250

BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to apply infection prevention and control measures, including interpersonal distancing and the use of personal protective equipment. These measures may impact communication and relationship between nurses, patients and caregivers especially in a complex environment, such as a paediatric setting. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was adopted. Reporting followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in two wards of a maternal and child health hospital in north-east Italy. Data were collected between September and November 2020. Transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen caregivers and 17 nurses were recruited using convenience sampling. Three themes were identified, namely: ""Impact on a trustworthy relationship""; ""Impact on common communication resources""; and ""Strategies to overcome barriers"". Participants agreed Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures impacted key elements of family-centred and compassionate care. Communication strategies and play were critical to overcoming the barriers encountered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 containment measures impact communication and family-centred care in paediatric hospital settings. There is a need for stakeholders to consider family needs in interventions aimed at controlling pandemics' impact. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While COVID-19 pandemic urgency intensified the use of PPE and social distancing, strategies to overcome issues related to family-centred care should be considered in those wards such as oncology or infectious disease paediatric departments where these measures are continuously adopted. Beyond a greater communication awareness, strategies may comprise the implementation of virtual care to guarantee support, continuity of care and information between the child, the healthcare team and the family members that are not admitted to the hospital for safety reasons.","Ferrari, Giada; Dobrina, Raffaella; Buchini, Sara; Rudan, Iva; Schreiber, Silvana; Bicego, Livia",J. clin. nurs,,250

Methods: The current study aimed to investigate serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer as well as lymphocytes and neutrophils count in COVID-19 patients, and to clarify the correlation of these parameters with disease severity and progression. For these purposes, (100) patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by polymerase chain reaction) and (20) apparently healthy people (with matched age and sex) were included in the current study and considered as a control group. Results: All study population (patients and control) were subjected to the evaluation of serum levels of IL-6, ferritin, CRP, LDH, D-dimer, as well as lymphocytes and neutrophils, count. COVID-19 patients showed a significant elevation in the levels of all parameters included in this study when compared with healthy controls. We also found that all of IL-6, ferritin, CRP, LDH, D-dimer are significantly associated with the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusion: Lymphopenia and increased neutrophils were also effectively correlated with disease progression. In line with these results, we concluded a proportional correlation between the aforementioned parameters and COVID-19 suggesting the uses of these tests to the diagnosis of critical cases.","Kadhim, A.

We compared the data with the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses included median (median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p &#8804; 0.05.Results - Acute trauma referrals in the post-COVID period were almost halved compared with 2019, with similar distribution between pediatric and adult patients, requiring a significant 19% more admissions (RR 1.3, OR 2.6, p = 0.003). Hip fractures and polytrauma cases accounted for an additional 11% of the modal number of injuries in 2020, but with 19% reduction in isolated limb injuries that were modal in 2019.

However, household person-to-person transmission studies are limited. Households participating in an ongoing cohort study of influenza incidence and prevalence in rural Egypt were followed. Baseline enrollment was done from August 2015 to March 2017. The study protocol was amended in April 2020 to allow COVID-19 incidence and seroprevalence studies. A total of 290 households including 1598 participants were enrolled and followed from April to October 2020 in four study sites. When a participant showed respiratory illness symptoms, a serum sample and a nasal and an oropharyngeal swab were obtained. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. If positive, the subject was followed and swabs collected on days three, six, nine, and 14 after the first swab day and a serum sample obtained on day 14. All subjects residing with the index case were swabbed following the same sampling schedule. Sera were collected from cohort participants in October 2020 to assess seroprevalence. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR. Sera were tested by Microneutralization Assay to measure the neutralizing antibody titer. Incidence of COVID-19, household secondary attack rate, and seroprevalence in the cohort were determined. The incidence of COVID-19 was 6.9% and the household secondary attack rate was 89.8%. Transmission within households occurred within two-days of confirming the index case. Infections were asymptomatic or mild with symptoms resolving within 10 days. The majority developed a neutralizing antibody titer by day 14 post onset. The overall seroprevalence among cohort participants was 34.8%. These results suggest that within-household transmission is high in Egypt. Asymptomatic or mild illness is common.

338055,"Who Helps the Helper? Taking Care of You, Your Family, and Your Team",2020,"Supply chains, as vital systems to the well-being of countries and economies, require systematic approaches to reduce their vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a non linear optimisation model to determine an effective distribution of protective resources among facilities in service and supply systems so as to reduce the probability of failure to which facilities are exposed in case of external disruptions. The failure probability of protected assets depends on the level of protection investments and the ultimate goal is to minimise the expected facility-customer transport or travel costs to provide goods and services. A linear version of the model is obtained by exploiting a specialised network flow structure. Furthermore, an efficient GRASP solution algorithm is developed to benchmark the linearised model and resolve numerical difficulties. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated using the Toronto hospital network. Protection measures within this context correspond to capacity expansion investments and reduce the likelihood that hospitals are unable to satisfy patient demand during periods of high hospitalisation (e.g. during a pandemic). Managerial insights on the protection resource distribution are discussed and a comparison between probabilistic and worst-case disruptions is provided. © Operational Research Society 2021.","Starita, S.; Paola Scaparra, M.",Journal of the Operational Research Society,,250

The purpose of this study was to describe changes in the weight-related behaviors of children with obesity after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Semistructured interviews (n = 51) were conducted from April to June 2020 with parents of children with obesity. Families were participants in a randomized trial testing a clinic-community pediatric obesity treatment model. During interviews, families described their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on children's diet, physical activity, sleep, and screen time behaviors. Rapid qualitative analysis methods were used to identify themes around changes in children's weight-related behaviors. Results: The mean child age was 9.7 (±2.8) years and the majority of children were Black (46%) or Hispanic (39%) and from low-income families (62%). Most parent participants were mothers (88%). There were differences in the perceived physical activity level of children, with some parents attributing increases in activity or maintenance of activity level to increased outdoor time, whereas others reported a decline due to lack of outdoor time, school, and structured activities. Key dietary changes included increased snacking and more meals prepared and consumed at home. There was a shift in sleep schedules with children going to bed and waking up later and an increase in leisure-based screen time. Parents played a role in promoting activity and managing children's screen time.

SpA - which includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis(PsA), and enteropathic arthritis - often affects young people who areotherwise fit and able. Many SpA patients take immunosuppressivemedications and therefore were advised to shield. In view of this, weconducted a survey to better understand how shielding has affectedthe physical activity and symptoms of SpA patients during thepandemic.MethodsAn online anonymised survey was created and advertised via socialmedia from 4th June to 4th July 2020. Patients with SpA were invitedto complete the survey which included 18 questions exploring theimpact of the pandemic on their symptoms, physical activity levels andmedication use.ResultsThere were 136 survey respondents, of whom 74.3% were female, with an age range from under 25 to over 75 years. The underlyingdiagnoses were PsA (60.5%), AS (28.4%), axSpA (10.5%) andenteropathic arthritis (0.8%). The majority (66.7%) of respondentswere shielding;44.1% were on disease modifying anti-rheumaticdrugs (csDMARDs) and 56.6% were on biologics (bDMARDs). Most(94.1%) had continued their DMARDs throughout the shielding period.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was reported to beincreased in 18.6% of respondents, and unchanged in 69.0%.Compared to before the pandemic, 54.8% reported worsening jointstiffness and 45.6% reported worsening joint pain.Most respondents (67.6%) reported reduced levels of physical activity, the commonest reasons being: shielding (54.6%);increased fatigue(45.8%);concerns around social distancing (45.4%);poor sleep quality(38.6%);working from home (28.6%) and low mood (28.6%). Only14.7% had attended a virtual exercise class.ConclusionApproximately 2 in 3 patients with SpA reported they were shieldingduring the first wave of the pandemic. Similar numbers of patientsreported reduced physical activity levels and increased joint stiffnessover this time. It is important to acknowledge that given the nature ofthe anonymised survey, we cannot be certain if the same patients whowere shielding were the same as those who had reduced levels ofphysical activity or worsening symptoms. We have, however, shownthat over half of the surveyed patients attributed their reduced physicalactivity levels to shielding. Taking into account that social restrictions(either self-imposed or government advised) are likely to be ongoing, we believe that a focus should be placed on supporting patients tomaintain their activity levels, through initiatives such as specialistvirtual exercise classes.","Naja, M.; Amarnani, R.; Castelino, M.",Rheumatology (United Kingdom),,250
338440,Mathematical Modelling of the Impact of Non-Pharmacological Strategies to Control the COVID-19 Epidemic in Portugal,2021,"The advantages of three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies, such as rapid-prototyping and the freedom to customize electrodes in any design, have elevated the benchmark of conventional electrochemical studies. Furthermore, the 3D printed electrodes conveniently accommodate other active layers for diverse applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and sensors. Nevertheless, to enhance a complex 3D structure while preserving the fine morphology, conformal deposition by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique is a powerful solution. Herein, we present the concept of coating Al2O3 by ALD with different thicknesses from 20 to 120 cycles on the 3D printed nanocarbon/PLA electrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of catechol as an important biomarker. Overall, 80 ALD cycle Al2O3 achieved an optimum thickness for catechol electrocatalysis. This is resonated with the enhanced adsorption of catechol at the electrode surface and efficient electron transfer, according to the two-proton, two-electron-transfer mechanism, as well as for the passivation of surface defects of the nanocarbon electrode. This work compellingly demonstrates the prospect of 3D printed electrodes modified by a functional layer utilizing a low-temperature ALD process that can be extended to other arbitrary surfaces.","Ng, Siowwoon; Iffelsberger, Christian; Michalicka, Jan; Pumera, Martin",ACS nano,,250

CDC recommends community use of face masks to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (1). As of October 22, 2020, statewide mask mandates were in effect in 33 states and the District of Columbia (2). This study examined whether implementation of statewide mask mandates was associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization growth rates among different age groups in 10 sites participating in the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) in states that issued statewide mask mandates during March 1-October 17, 2020. Regression analysis demonstrated that weekly hospitalization growth rates declined by 2.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.3-5.5) among adults aged 40-64 years during the first 2 weeks after implementing statewide mask mandates. After mask mandates had been implemented for &#8805;3 weeks, hospitalization growth rates declined by 5.5 percentage points among persons aged 18-39 years (95% CI = 0.6-10.4) and those aged 40-64 years (95% CI = 0.8-10.2). Statewide mask mandates might be associated with reductions in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and might contribute to reductions in COVID-19 hospitalization growth rates, compared with growth rates during <4 weeks before implementation of the mandate and the implementation week. Mask-wearing is a component of a multipronged strategy to decrease exposure to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce strain on the health care system, with likely direct effects on COVID-19 morbidity and associated mortality.","Joo, Heesoo; Miller, Gabrielle F; Sunshine, Gregory; Gakh, Maxim; Pike, Jamison; Havers, Fiona P; Kim, Lindsay; Weber, Regen; Dugmeoglu, Sebnem; Watson, Christina; Coronado, Fátima",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,250

The results showed that the antimalarial drug Metaquine and anti-HIV antiretroviral Saquinavir interacted with all the studied receptors, indicating that they are potential candidates for multitarget drugs for COVID-19.","Barros, Romulo O; Junior, Fabio L C C; Pereira, Wildrimak S; Oliveira, Neiva M N; Ramos, Ricardo M",,,250
339523,A phenomenological approach to COVID-19 spread in a population,2020-03-28,"Nowadays, the field of healthcare is facing difficult issues in a way that both public and private sectors are fully aware of their inability to address emerging public health-related issues without the help of the other sector. Accordingly, public-private partnerships are put on the agenda in policy-related issues as a mechanism of cooperation between the public and private sectors to take into account the interests of both parties in the related contracts. From the late of 2019, the world is struggling with a new virus called the coronavirus, which has already cost a lot to the health sector. The partnership between the government and the private sector is very important to get through the corona period since the government alone cannot be responsible for the negative effects of the virus in the field of health. Considering the successes and failures of countries in the implementation of partnership models, a question arises as to how such partnerships for health development strategies can be attractive and effective in developing Islamic countries. In addition to the review of theoretical foundations of the subject and examining the development process of public-private partnerships, the study emphasizes the use of the third sector capacities. It further reviews the endowments and charitable affairs in the framework of multi-sectoral partnerships to develop health in the community with all available potentiality. The theoretical framework of the research includes the four steps of policy-making in the country, creating common perspectives among stakeholders, ensuring key success factors in the project, and reviewing the achievements of participation are considered. These policies are described after classifying and reconstructing the components in the research literature.","Motamedi, M.; Vaezi, R.; Alvani, S.

The purpose of this review is to identify specific threats to the validity of the COVID-19 literature and to recommend resources for practicing rheumatologists and their patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 literature has rapidly expanded and includes 17â998 publications through May of 2020, 1543 of which also address rheumatic disease-related topics. Specific obstacles to acquiring high-quality information have arisen, including 'pandemic research exceptionalism' and a 'parallel pandemic' of misinformation. Unique challenges to rheumatologists include specific interest in antirheumatic disease therapies and a paucity of rheumatology-specific information. Patients with rheumatic diseases have faced shortages of critical medications and a lack of information tailored to their health conditions and medications. SUMMARY: We recommend rheumatologists develop a system to acquire high-quality information and offer guiding principles for triaging specific resources, which include relevance, accessibility, credibility, timeliness, and trustworthiness. The same principles can be applied to selecting patient oriented resources. Specific trustworthy resources are recommended.","Duron, Garret; Gelman, Lauren; Dua, Anisha; Putman, Michael",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,250
339961,The Interactive Web – Open Access COVID-19 Resources,2020,"The aim was to evaluate the physical properties and anti-bacterial activity of resin cement containing ursolic acid (UA) and determine the optimal concentration of UA. Five types of experimental resin cement were prepared according to UA concentration (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt%). Flexural strength, film thickness and in vitro cytotoxicity were measured to confirm whether the resin was appropriate under International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria. Fifty extracted human molars were prepared, and indirect resin inlays were cemented with experimental resins. Acid-resistant nail varnish was applied, except for the 2-mm area around the restoration. Artificial caries were induced for 6 days through Streptococcus (S.) mutans (ATCC25175). Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) was used to evaluate the caries progression. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Dunnett correction were used to statistically analyze the data. In all groups, the physical property of flexural strength, film thickness, and cytotoxicity were satisfied for ISO criteria (p > 0.05). On &#8710;F (-%) and &#8710;Q (-%â Px) values as QLF parameters, there was a tendency of being lower in groups of resin cement containing higher concentration of UA. Resin cement containing UA of greater than or equal to 0.5% significantly inhibited caries in the area around restoration (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups containing UA of greater than or equal to 0.5%. Resin cement containing 0.5% or more UA showed anti-carious effect in the limited range of 2% and satisfied the ISO criteria for flexural strength, film thickness and cytotoxicity.","Yoo, Hyunkyung; Kim, So Youn; Shin, Su-Jung; Park, Jeong-Won",Odontology,,250

In each case, a treatment decision must be reached based on best clinical practices for the disorder, patient comorbidities, the current state of knowledge about the pathogenesis and infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the utilization of hospital and community resources. Unfortunately, the evidence needed to standardize the decision-making process for each neuro-ophthalmologic disorder is currently absent and is likely to require months or years to develop based on the accrual of robust international data sets.

342331,A mathematical framework for estimating risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19 with application to face mask use and social distancing,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused enormous confusion around the world in our daily existence. The security measures taken, such as physical distance, wearing a mask, quarantine or closing shopping malls, and even isolating large groups of the population, did not contribute to the complete overcoming of the problem. Information on the positive results of research into the COVID-19 vaccine and, finally, its administration offered hope that the pandemic would be overcome. The undertaken problem of research concerning the subjective analysis of the feelings of doctors in Poland after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine shows an important area of the medical world, which is directly responsible for their own health and the patients entrusted to them. In addition, 149 people participated in the study (8-13 February 2021), including 57% of women and 43% of men. The minimum and maximum age of the respondents are 26 and 69 years old. Furthermore, 85% of respondents took two doses of the vaccine and 15% took one. The authorial questionnaire was completed by the participants in the study online in February 2021. The results obtained indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine generates hope for stopping the pandemic. In addition, 96% of research participants think so. Doctors in middle and mature age are the most optimistic, while the youngest ones are less optimistic. In addition, 57% of respondents do not worry about side effects after taking the vaccine. Fear at the time of vaccination was experienced by over 9% of doctors. The most frequently reported post-vaccination reactions are injection site pain, fatigue and headache. Increased temperature occurred in older female respondents. From a psychosocial perspective, men are more likely to fear being infected personally with the virus, and women are more likely to be infected with their loved ones. The presented subjective assessment presents the physicians' view captured at the moment in terms of existential and emotional. The presented feelings of the research participants reflect their personal satisfaction, responsibility for their own health, care for their relatives and patients.","Zdziarski, Krzysztof; Landowski, Marek; Zabielska, Paulina; Karakiewicz, Beata",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,250
342402,Regional air pollution persistence links to COVID-19 infection zoning,2020,"BACKGROUND: Virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-genetic multimeric nanoparticles synthesized through in vitro or in vivo self-assembly of one or more viral structural proteins. Immunogenicity and safety of VLPs make them ideal candidates for vaccine development and efficient nanocarriers for foreign antigens or adjuvants to activate the immune system. AIMS: The present study aimed to design and synthesize a chimeric VLP vaccine of the phage Qbeta (Qß) coat protein presenting the universal epitope of the coronavirus. METHODS: The RNA phage Qß coat protein was designed and synthesized, denoted as Qbeta. The CoV epitope, a universal epitope of coronavirus, was inserted into the C-terminal of Qbeta using genetic recombination, which was designated as Qbeta-CoV. The N-terminal of Qbeta-CoV was successively inserted into the TEV restriction site using mCherry red fluorescent label and modified affinity-purified histidine label 6xHE, which was denoted as HE-Qbeta-CoV. Isopropyl ß-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) assessment revealed the expression of Qbeta, Qbeta-CoV, and HE-Qbeta-CoV in the BL21 (DE3) cells. The fusion protein was purified by salting out using ammonium sulfate and affinity chromatography. The morphology of particles was observed using electron microscopy. The female BALB/C mice were immunized intraperitoneally with the Qbeta-CoV and HE-Qbeta-CoV chimeric VLPs vaccines. Their sera were collected for the detection of antibody level and antibody titer using ELISA. The serum is used for the neutralization test of the three viruses of MHV, PEDV, and PDCoV. RESULTS: The results revealed that the fusion proteins Qbeta, Qbeta-CoV, and HE-Qbeta-CoV could all obtain successful expression. Particles with high purity were obtained after purification; the chimeric particles of Qbeta-CoV and HE-Qbeta-CoV were found to be similar to Qbeta particles in morphology and formed chimeric VLPs. In addition, two chimeric VLP vaccines induced specific antibody responses in mice, and the antibodies showed certain neutralizing activity. CONCLUSION: The successful construction of the chimeric VLPs of the phage Qß coat protein presenting the universal epitope of coronavirus provides a vaccine form with potential clinical applications for the treatment of coronavirus disease.","Guo, Yukun; Guo, Ruizhen; Ma, Yingxian; Chang, Wenru; Ming, Shengli; Yang, Guoyu; Guo, Yujie",Curr. top. med. chem,,250
342648,Redefining Self-Interest - The US Response to COVID-19,2020,"Toxoplasma gondii, the etiological agent of toxoplasmosis, can cause serious public health problems. Although Toxoplasma gondii tends more to neurotropic and ocular organs, some existing evidence suggest that this disease might induce serious pathological effects on liver. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between chronic liver diseases and toxoplasmosis. Meanwhile, it attempted to assess whether patients with toxoplasmosis are susceptible to chronic liver diseases. To achieve this aim, the published studies related to the subject were systematically searched in five major electronic databases between the January 1, 1950 and October 1, 2019. The meta-analysis was carried out using the StatsDirect statistical software and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant for any test. Out of 691 identified studies, 10 studies met our inclusion criteria and entered this systematic review. The pooled prevalence rates of Toxoplasma gondii in patients with liver diseases (35.97%; 95% CI: 28.38-43.93) were higher than those in the control group (18.24%; 95% CI: 13.85-23.09). The meta-analysis indicated that the common Odd Ratio by a random effect model was 2.7 (95% CI: 2.30-3.24), revealing a significant association between chronic liver diseases and anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody. The results of this systematic review confirmed the positive connection between toxoplasmosis and chronic liver diseases.

342828,Women in academia: a warning on selection bias in gender studies from the astronomical perspective,2020-12-04,"Introduction: Cholecystectomy is the most frequently performed procedure in general surgery. The consent procedure for cholecystectomy needs to inform patients about the possibility of subtotal cholecystectomy (STC) as an alternative procedure used for ""difficult gallbladders"" as it is associated with increased postoperative morbidity. We sought to determine the quality of informed consent for patients who were scheduled for cholecystectomy but underwent STC, and evaluate whether patient or procedural factors influenced the information discussed in consenting. Materials and Methods: We classified 57 components of information necessary for a patient to give informed consent for cholecystectomy. We retrospectively reviewed the consent forms of patients scheduled for conventional cholecystecomy but instead undergoing STC between 2011 and 2017. Consent quality was measured as the percentage of components completed. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, setting (elective/nonelective), operation mode (open/laparoscopic), or the responsible surgeon affected consent quality. Results: Across 174 patients, just 9 (5.2%) had been informed about the possibility of undergoing STC, whereas the overall quality of consent was 37.5%. Patient and setting-specific factors affected the completion of specific consent components. Patients were more likely to receive a patient information leaflet if they were female (relative risk [RR] 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-7.00), <60 years (RR 3.32; 95% CI 1.39-7.90) or undergoing laparoscopic surgery (RR 8.04; 95% CI 2.50-25.88). Conclusion: The suboptimal quality of consent and multiple inconsistencies in the information disclosed to different patient cohorts emphasize the need for a more transparent and consistent consenting process.","Mesri, Mina; Nzenwa, Ikemsinachi C; Lunevicius, Raimundas","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",,250

343799,A Spatio-Temporal Analysis of the Environmental Correlates of COVID-19 Incidence in Spain,2020,"BACKGROUND: Significant uncertainty has existed about the safety of reopening college and university campuses before the COVID-19 pandemic is better controlled. Moreover, little is known about the effects that on-campus students may have on local higher-risk communities. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the range of potential community and campus COVID-19 exposures, infections, and mortality under various university reopening plans and uncertainties. METHODS: We developed campus-only, community-only, and campus × community epidemic differential equations and agent-based models, with inputs estimated via published and grey literature, expert opinion, and parameter search algorithms. Campus opening plans (spanning fully open, hybrid, and fully virtual approaches) were identified from websites and publications. Additional student and community exposures, infections, and mortality over 16-week semesters were estimated under each scenario, with 10% trimmed medians, standard deviations, and probability intervals computed to omit extreme outliers. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to inform potential effective interventions. RESULTS: Predicted 16-week campus and additional community exposures, infections, and mortality for the base case with no precautions (or negligible compliance) varied significantly from their medians (4- to 10-fold). Over 5% of on-campus students were infected after a mean of 76 (SD 17) days, with the greatest increase (first inflection point) occurring on average on day 84 (SD 10.2 days) of the semester and with total additional community exposures, infections, and mortality ranging from 1-187, 13-820, and 1-21 per 10,000 residents, respectively. Reopening precautions reduced infections by 24%-26% and mortality by 36%-50% in both populations. Beyond campus and community reproductive numbers, sensitivity analysis indicated no dominant factors that interventions could primarily target to reduce the magnitude and variability in outcomes, suggesting the importance of comprehensive public health measures and surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Community and campus COVID-19 exposures, infections, and mortality resulting from reopening campuses are highly unpredictable regardless of precautions. Public health implications include the need for effective surveillance and flexible campus operations.","Benneyan, James; Gehrke, Christopher; Ilies, Iulian; Nehls, Nicole",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,250

345435,"COVID-19, Families, and Family Therapy: Shining Light into the Darkness",2020,"Background: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current global pandemic and understandably, Obstetrics is not spared. Private maternity hospitals have a unique challenge of reassuring unaffected patients of uneventful delivery with the lowest possible rate of coronavirus infection while consequently offering compassionate and state of art services to women who turn out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. This has led to a routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of all patients before admission in many of the private hospitals in India. The current study was undertaken to determine the incidence of SARS-COV-2 among asymptomatic pregnant women and to ascertain the utility of universal screening in these women. Methodology: A retrospective observational multi-center study was conducted over a period of approximately 5 months (1-May-2020 to 10-September-2020) in a chain of privately run maternity hospitals with presence in multiple cities across India. All asymptomatic pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 prior to elective/emergency hospital admission. Results: Among 4158 women tested, 54 (1.3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and intra partum and postnatal period was uneventful for all of them. Conclusion: Universal screening should be continued as preferred approach to ensure low anxiety levels of delivering women and safety of frontline workers. Further, universal screening helps avoid emergence of maternity centers as virus clusters by effective isolation of identified positive cases and minimizing points of contact.","Sharma, Shreyasi; Wazir, Sanjay; Kumar, Rajagopal Kishore",J Obstet Gynaecol India,,250

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), as two novel technologies, have been used in many fields for emergency management of disasters. The objective of this paper was to review VR and AR applications in the emergency management of infectious outbreaks with an emphasis on the COVID-19 outbreak. A search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, IEEE, Cochrane Library, Google engine, Google scholar, and related websites for papers published up to May 2, 2020. The VR technology has been used for preventing or responding to infections by simulating human behaviors, infection transmission, and pathogen structure as a means for improving skills management and safety protection. Telehealth, telecommunication, and drug discovery have been among the other applications of VR during this pandemic. Moreover, AR has also been used in various industries, including healthcare, marketing, universities, and schools. Providing high-resolution audio and video communication, facilitating remote collaboration, and allowing the visualization of invisible concepts are some of the advantages of using this technology. However, VR has been used more frequently than AR in the emergency management of previous infectious diseases with a greater focus on education and training. The potential applications of these technologies for COVID-19 can be categorized into four groups, i.e., 1) entertainment, 2) clinical context, 3) business and industry, and 4) education and training. The results of this study indicate that VR and AR have the potential to be used for emergency management of infectious diseases. Further research into employing these technologies will have a substantial impact on mitigating the destructive effects of infectious diseases. Making use of all the potential applications of these technologies should be considered for the emergency management of the current pandemic and mitigating its negative impacts.","Asadzadeh, Afsoon; Samad-Soltani, Taha",Inform Med Unlocked,,250

METHODS: We evaluated 11 risk stratification scores in a binational retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in São Paulo and Barcelona: Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB, CURB-65, qSOFA, Infectious Disease Society of America and American Thoracic Society Minor Criteria, REA-ICU, SCAP, SMART-COP, CALL, COVID GRAM and 4C. The primary and secondary outcomes were 30-day in-hospital mortality and 7-day intensive care unit (ICU) admission, respectively. We compared their predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 1363 patients, the mean (SD) age was 61 (16) years. The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 24.6% (228/925) in São Paulo and 21.0% (92/438) in Barcelona. For in-hospital mortality, we found higher AUCs for PSI (0.79, 95% CI 0.77-0.82), 4C (0.78, 95% CI 0.75-0.81), COVID GRAM (0.77, 95% CI 0.75-0.80) and CURB-65 (0.74, 95% CI 0.72-0.77). Results were similar for both countries. For the 1%-20% threshold range in decision curve analysis, PSI would avoid a higher number of unnecessary interventions, followed by the 4C score. All scores had poor performance (AUC <0.65) for 7-day ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Recent clinical COVID-19 assessment scores had comparable performance to standard pneumonia prognostic tools. Because it is expected that new scores outperform older ones during development, external validation studies are needed before recommending their use.","Lazar Neto, Felippe; Marino, Lucas Oliveira; Torres, Antoni; Cilloniz, Catia; Meirelles Marchini, Julio Flavio; Garcia de Alencar, Julio Cesar; Palomeque, Andrea; Albacar, Núria; Brandão Neto, Rodrigo Antônio; Souza, Heraldo Possolo; Ranzani, Otavio T",Clin. microbiol. infect,,250

Smell loss has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is unknown whether monitoring for smell loss can be used to identify asymptomatic infection among high risk individuals. In this study we sought to determine if tracking smell sensitivity and loss using an at-home assessment could identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a prospective cohort study tracking 473 HCW across three months to determine if smell loss could predict SARS-CoV-2 infection in this high-risk group. HCW subjects completed a longitudinal, behavioral at-home assessment of olfaction with household items, as well as detailed symptom surveys that included a parosmia screening questionnaire, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our main measures were the prevalence of smell loss in SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW versus SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW, and timing of smell loss relative to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 17 (3.6%) of 473 HCW. HCW with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more likely to report smell loss than SARS-CoV-2-negative HCW on both the at-home assessment and the screening questionnaire (9/17, 53% vs 105/456, 23%, P < .01). 6/9 (67%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW reporting smell loss reported smell loss prior to having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and smell loss was reported a median of two days before testing positive. Neurological symptoms were reported more frequently among SARS-CoV-2-positive HCW who reported smell loss compared to those without smell loss (9/9, 100% vs 3/8, 38%, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of HCW, self-reported changes in smell using two different measures were predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smell loss frequently preceded a positive test and was associated with neurological symptoms.","Weiss, Julian J; Attuquayefio, Tuki N; White, Elizabeth B; Li, Fangyong; Herz, Rachel S; White, Theresa L; Campbell, Melissa; Geng, Bertie; Datta, Rupak; Wyllie, Anne L; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Muenker, M Catherine; Moore, Adam J; Handoko, Ryan; Iwasaki, Akiko; Martinello, Richard A; Ko, Albert I; Small, Dana M; Farhadian, Shelli F",PLoS One,,250

While reactor designers have made tremendous strides with these systems, licensing and deployment of these reactors will be aided through the development of new technology such as on-line and remote monitoring tools. Of particular interest is quantifying reactor off-gas species, such as iodine, within off-gas streams to support the design and operational control of off-gas treatment systems. Here, the development of advanced Raman spectroscopy systems for the on-line analysis of gas composition is discussed, focusing on the key control species I2(g). Signal response was explored with two Raman instruments, utilizing 532 and 671 nm excitation sources, as a function of I2(g) pressure and temperature. Also explored is the integration of advanced data analysis methods to enable real-time and highly accurate analysis of complex optical data. Specifically, the application of chemometric modeling is discussed. Raman spectroscopy paired with chemometric analysis is demonstrated to provide a powerful route to analyzing I2(g) composition within the gas phase, which lays the foundation for applications within molten salt reactor off-gas analysis and other significant chemical processes producing iodine species.","Felmy, Heather M; Clifford, Andrew J; Medina, Adan Schafer; Cox, Richard M; Wilson, Jennifer M; Lines, Amanda M; Bryan, Samuel A",Environ. sci. technol,,250

DesignSystematic review and network meta-analysis Data sourcesWHO COVID-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19 literature, and two prospective meta-analyses Study selectionTrials in which people with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 were randomized to IL-6 receptor blockers (with or without corticosteroids), corticosteroids, placebo, or standard care. ResultsWe assessed the risk of bias of included trials using a modification of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We performed a Bayesian fixed effect network meta-analysis and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We identified 45 eligible trials (20,650 patients), 36 (19,350 patients) of which could be included in the network meta-analysis. 27 of 36 trials were rated at high risk of bias, primarily due to lack of blinding. Tocilizumab (20 more per 1000, 15 fewer to 59 more; low certainty) and sarilumab (11 more per 1000, 38 fewer to 55 more; low certainty) alone may not reduce the risk of death. Tocilizumab, in combination with corticosteroids, probably reduces the risk of death compared to corticosteroids alone (35 fewer per 1000, 52 fewer to 18 more; moderate certainty) and sarilumab, in combination with corticosteroids, may reduce the risk of death compared to corticosteroids alone (43 fewer, 73 fewer to 12 more; low certainty). Tocilizumab and sarilumab, both in combination with corticosteroids, may have similar effects (8 more per 1000, 20 fewer to 35 more; low certainty).

349603,Coronavirus (COVID-19) and its Relationship with Ocular Surface,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although immune modulation is a promising therapeutic avenue in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most relevant targets remain to be found. COVID-19 has peculiar characteristics and outcomes, suggesting a unique immunopathogenesis. METHODS: Thirty-six immunocompetent non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in a single center, most requiring intensive care. Clinical and biological characteristics (including T cell phenotype and function and plasma concentrations of 30 cytokines) and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: At similar baseline respiratory severity, COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation for significantly longer than non-COVID-19 patients (15 [7-22] vs. 4 (0-15) days; p = 0.0049). COVID-19 patients had lower levels of most classical inflammatory cytokines (G-CSF, CCL20, IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, TNF-&#945;, TGF-ß), but higher plasma concentrations of CXCL10, GM-CSF and CCL5, compared to non-COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients displayed similar T-cell exhaustion to non-COVID-19 patients, but with a more unbalanced inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine response (IL-6/IL-10 and TNF-&#945;/IL-10 ratios). Principal component analysis identified two main patterns, with a clear distinction between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients. Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that GM-CSF, CXCL10 and IL-10 levels were independently associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: We identified a unique cytokine response, with higher plasma GM-CSF and CXCL10 in COVID-19 patients that were independently associated with the longer duration of mechanical ventilation. These cytokines could represent the dysregulated immune response in severe COVID-19, as well as promising therapeutic targets.

Fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM) is a structural analogue of Memantine, functionalized with a fluorine group that allowed its use as a positron emission tomography tracer. We here analyzed FENM neuroprotective potential in a pharmacological model of AD, in comparison to Memantine. METHODS: Swiss mice were treated intracerebroventricularly with aggregated Aß25-35 peptide and examined after one week in a battery of memory tests (spontaneous alternation; passive avoidance; object recognition; place learning in the water-maze; topographic memory in the Hamlet). Toxicity induced in the mouse hippocampus or cortex was analyzed biochemically or morphologically. RESULTS: Both Memantine and FENM showed symptomatic anti-amnesic effects in Aß25-35-treated mice. Interestingly, FENM was not amnesic when tested alone at 10 mg/kg, contrarily to Memantine. Drugs injected once-a-day prevented Aß25-35-induced memory deficits, oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, cytochrome c release), inflammation (IL-6, TNF&#945; increases; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and cortex), and apoptosis and cell loss (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio; cell loss in the hippocampus CA1 area). However, FENM effects were more robust than observed with Memantine, with significant attenuations vs. the Aß25-35-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: FENM therefore appeared as a potent neuroprotective drug in an AD model, with a superior efficacy as compared with Memantine, and an absence of direct amnesic effect at higher doses. These results open the possibility to use the compound at more relevant dosages than the ones actually proposed in Memantine treatment for AD.","Couly, Simon; Denus, Morgane; Bouchet, Mélanie; Rubinstenn, Gilles; Maurice, Tangui",Int. j. neuropsychopharmacol,,250

Several aspects of the pathogenesis of neosporosis in naturally infected goats remain to be established. The aims of the present study were to characterize the placental lesions in goats naturally infected by N. caninum and to evaluate several diagnostic techniques for effective detection of this protozoan in the goat placenta. Some placentas in this study originated from abortion and stillbirth in which there were severe lesions. The lesions were characterized mainly by necrosis involving the mesenchyme of the chorionic villi and trophoblast cells often alongside mononuclear inflammation and in some cases with neutrophilic infiltration. N. caninum DNA was detected in these placentas, but parasite structures were not visualized through immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, five of 11 placentas from N. caninum-infected goats that gave birth to healthy kids had histological lesions characterized by mononuclear inflammation. Of these 11 placentas, N. caninum DNA was detected in seven, and N. caninum tachyzoites were detected in only one of these seven placentas using IHC. The present study demonstrates that severe lesions in the placenta are associated with abortion and stillbirth in caprine neosporosis and the placental alterations are likely involved in abortion pathogenesis. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of using more than one diagnostic technique for the detection of the protozoan in placentas because N. caninum cannot be reliably detected by histological and immunohistochemical tests.(AU)","Mesquita, Leonardo P; Costa, Rafael C; Nogueira, Clayton I; Abreu, Camila C; Orlando, Débora R; Ascari Junior, Ivan; Peconick, Ana Paula; Varaschin, Mary S",Pesqui. vet. bras,,250

353937,"Audience Engagement with COVID-19 News: The Impact of Lockdown and Live Coverage, and the Role of Polarization",2021,"In resource allocation, it is common to assume that agents have a utility for their allocated items and zero utility for unallocated ones. We refer to such valuation domain as 1-D. This assumption of zero utility for unallocated items is not always valid. For example, in the pandemic, allocation of ventilators, oxygen beds, and critical medical help yields dis-utility to an agent when not received in time, i.e., a setting where people consume resources at the cost of others' utility. Various externalities affect an agent's utility, i.e., when an agent doesn't receive an item, it can result in their gain (positive externalities) or loss (negative externalities). The existing preference models lack capturing the setting with these externalities. We conduct a study on a 2-D domain, where each agent has a utility ($v$) for an item assigned to it and utility ($v'$) for an item not allocated to it. We consider a generalized model, i.e., goods and chores. There is a vast literature to allocate fairly and efficiently. We observe that adapting the existing notions of fairness and efficiency to the 2-D domain is non-trivial. We propose a utility transformation ($T_u$) and valuation transformation ($T_v$) to convert from the 2-D domain to 1-D. We study the retention of fairness and efficiency property given this transformation, i.e., an allocation with property $\mathcal{P}$ in a 1-D domain also satisfies property $\mathcal{P}$ in 2-D, and vice versa. If a property is retainable, we can apply the transformation, and all the existing approaches are valid for the 2-D domain. Further, we study whether we can apply current results in a 2-D domain when they do not retain. We explore fairness notions such as Envy-freeness (EF), Equitability (EQ), Maxmin Share (MMS), and Proportionality and efficiency notions such as Pareto Optimality, Utilitarian Welfare, Nash Welfare, and Egalitarian Welfare.","Mishra, Shaily; Padala, Manisha; Gujar, Sujit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12806v1.pdf,250

It can lead to multiorgan failure, including respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation, and kidney injury, with significant associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory or kidney disease. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, has shown significant cardio- and renoprotective benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes (with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and may provide similar organ protection in high-risk patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DARE-19 (NCT04350593) is an investigator-initiated, collaborative, international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study testing the dual hypotheses that dapagliflozin can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, kidney and/or respiratory complications or all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 but not critically ill on admission. Eligible patients will have &#8805;1 cardiometabolic risk factor for COVID-19 complications. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Primary efficacy endpoints are time to development of new or worsened organ dysfunction during index hospitalization, or all-cause mortality, and the hierarchical composite endpoint of change in clinical status through day 30 of treatment. Safety of dapagliflozin in individuals with COVID-19 will be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: DARE-19 will evaluate whether dapagliflozin can prevent COVID-19-related complications and all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, and assess the safety profile of dapagliflozin in this patient population. Currently, DARE-19 is the first large randomized controlled trial investigating use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.","Kosiborod, Mikhail; Berwanger, Otavio; Koch, Gary G; Martinez, Felipe; Mukhtar, Omar; Verma, Subodh; Chopra, Vijay; Javaheri, Ali; Ambery, Philip; Gasparyan, Samvel B; Buenconsejo, Joan; Sjöström, C David; Langkilde, Anna Maria; Oscarsson, Jan; Esterline, Russell",Diabetes obes. metab,,250

Robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interactions have gained an increased presence to help manage the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals, airports, transportation systems, recreation and scenic areas, hotels, restaurants, and communities in general. Humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other intelligent robots are used in many different ways to reduce human contact and the potential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including delivering materials, disinfecting and sterilizing public spaces, detecting or measuring body temperature, providing safety or security, and comforting and entertaining patients. While controversial in the past due to concerns over job losses and data privacy, the adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism will likely continue after the COVID-19 pandemic becomes less serious.

METHODS: Households were followed annually for identification of acute respiratory illness with RT-PCR confirmed HCoV infection. Serum collected before and at two time points post infection were tested using a multiplex binding assay to quantify antibody to seasonal, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and SARS-CoV-2 spike sub-domains and N protein. RESULTS: Of 3418 participants, 40% were followed for &#8805;3years. A total of 1004 HCoV infections were documented; 303 (30%) were reinfections of any HCoV type. The number of HCoV infections ranged from 1 to 13 per individual. The mean time to reinfection with the same type was estimated at 983 days for 229E, 578 days for HKU1, 615 days for OC43, and 711 days for NL63. Binding antibody levels to seasonal HCoVs were high, with little increase post-infection, and were maintained over time. Homologous, pre-infection antibody levels did not significantly correlate with odds of infection, and there was little cross response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

358970,Editorial: The Year in Review Amidst the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a major risk to health care delivery all around the world and also poses significant risks to the public and health care workers (HCWs). Surgical procedures, particularly elective procedures, have been cancelled or deferred due to increased risks associated with surgery and anesthesia both to the patient and the HCWs as well as to allocate resources to treat infected patients. This is particularly true for patients with comorbidities and cancer. As countries emerge from this pandemic, a phased return to conventional surgical procedures is being proposed, with emphasis on procedures performed in ambulatory settings and avoiding endotracheal intubation, where possible. Interventional radiological (IR) procedures offer a unique advantage in this setting, as these procedures are often performed with local or regional anesthesia with shorter hospital stay. In this brief communication, we outline the current opinion on surgical risks and guidelines and suggest areas where interventional therapies may offer an advantage to the multidisciplinary team and patient.","Roy-Choudhury, Shuvro H.; Warawdekar, Gireesh",J.

360131,"Four pandemics: Lessons learned, lessons lost",2021,"AIMS: Inflammation has important roles in atherosclerosis. CD4+CD28null (CD28null) T cells are a specialised T lymphocyte subset that produce inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. CD28null T cells expand preferentially in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rather than stable angina and are barely detectable in healthy subjects. Importantly, ACS patients with CD28null T cell expansion have increased risk for recurrent acute coronary events and poor prognosis, compared to ACS patients in whom this cell subset does not expand. The mechanisms regulating CD28null T cell expansion in ACS remain elusive. We therefore investigated the role of cytokines in CD28null T cell expansion in ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-purity sorted CD4+ T cells from ACS patients were treated with a panel of cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-7, IL-15), and effects on the number, phenotype and function of CD28null T cells were analysed and compared to the control counterpart CD28+ T cell subset. IL-7 and IL-15 induced expansion of CD28null T cells from ACS patients, while inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß and IL-6 did not. The mechanisms underlying CD28null T cell expansion by IL-7/IL-15 were preferential activation and proliferation of CD28null T cells compared to control CD28+ T cells. Additionally, IL-7/IL-15 markedly augmented CD28null T cell cytotoxic function and interferon-Î³ production. Further mechanistic analyses revealed differences in baseline expression of component chains of IL-7/IL-15 receptors (CD127 and CD122) and increased baseline STAT5 phosphorylation in CD28null T cells from ACS patients compared to the control CD28+ T cell subset. Notably, we demonstrate that CD28null T cell expansion was significantly inhibited by Tofacitinib, a selective JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor that blocks IL-7/IL-15 signalling. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel data show that IL-7 and IL-15 drive the expansion and function of CD28null T cells from ACS patients suggesting that IL-7/IL-15 blockade may prevent expansion of these cells and improve patient outcomes. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: CD28null T cells expansion in ACS patients is an independent predictor of future acute coronary events and poor prognosis. The precise mechanisms underlying CD28null T cell expansion in ACS remain elusive. We show that IL-7 and IL-15 cytokines cause expansion of CD28null T cells from ACS patients by triggering activation and proliferation, and augment the cytotoxic function of these cells and production of inflammatory cytokines. We demonstrate that CD28null T cell expansion is inhibited by Tofacitinib that specifically blocks IL-7/IL-15 signalling. Further dissection of the roles of IL-7/IL-15 may lead to more effective and specific anti-inflammatory therapies in ACS.","Bullenkamp, Jessica; Mengoni, Veronica; Kaur, Satdip; Chhetri, Ismita; Dimou, Paraskevi; Astroulakis, Zoë M J; Kaski, Juan Carlos; Dumitriu, Ingrid E",Cardiovasc. res,,250
360162,Small Business Post–COVID-19: Motivational Needs through Uncertain Times,2020,"How will higher education be different postpandemic? How might colleges and universities build on the lessons of COVID-19 to evolve their institutions? We do not yet know the answers to these questions. Likely, the changes to higher education after widespread vaccination and a ""return to normal"" will vary greatly from college to college. Just as there was no ""one way"" to run a university pre-COVID-19, there exists no single template or model to guide the post-COVID-19 university. What we do know is that now is the time to start figuring out what comes next. If colleges and universities fail to plan for life after COVID-19, then they will most likely slide back to the pre-COVID-19 status quo. The postpandemic higher education story, however, is not all doom and gloom.

360346,Mindless Response or Mindful Interpretation: Examining the Effect of Message Influence on Phishing Susceptibility,2021,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety impact up to 1 in 5 pregnant and postpartum women worldwide. Yet, as few as 20% of these women are treated with frontline interventions such as evidence-based psychological treatments. Major barriers to uptake are the limited number of specialized mental health treatment providers in most settings, and problems with accessing in-person care, such as childcare or transportation. Task sharing of treatment to non-specialist providers with delivery on telemedicine platforms could address such barriers. However, the equivalence of these strategies to specialist and in-person models remains unproven. METHODS: This study protocol outlines the Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) randomized trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, non-inferiority test of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a brief, behavioral activation (BA) treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Specialists (psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers with &#8805; 5 years of therapy experience) and non-specialists (nurses and midwives with no formal training in mental health care) were trained in the BA protocol, with the latter supervised by a BA expert during treatment delivery. Consenting pregnant and postpartum women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of &#8805; 10 (N = 1368) will be randomized to one of four arms (telemedicine specialist, telemedicine non-specialist, in-person specialist, in-person non-specialist), stratified by pregnancy status (antenatal/postnatal) and study site. The primary outcome is participant-reported depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes are maternal symptoms of anxiety and trauma symptoms, perceived social support, activation levels and quality of life at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization, and depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month post-randomization. Primary analyses are per-protocol and intent-to-treat. The study has successfully continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with needed adaptations, including temporary suspension of the in-person arms and ongoing randomization to telemedicine arms. DISCUSSION: The SUMMIT trial is expected to generate evidence on the non-inferiority of BA delivered by a non-specialist provider compared to specialist and telemedicine compared to in-person. If confirmed, results could pave the way to a dramatic increase in access to treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04153864 .

360503,Aesthetic Office Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Limited information is available regarding barriers to breastfeeding during the COVID-19 lockdown. STUDY DESIGN: This study was designed as a non-concurrent case-control study on breastfeeding initiation practices, defined according to WHO, in women giving birth during lockdown, between March 8 and May 18, 2020, in the COVID-19 'hotspot' in Northeastern Italy (study group), with an antecedent puerperae-matched group (control group). Exclusive, complementary, and formula feeding practices were collected from maternal charts at hospital discharge, on the second day post-partum, when puerperae filled out the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: The COVID-19 study group presented significantly lower exclusive breastfeeding rates than the control group who members gave birth the previous year (-15%, p = 0.003), as a consequence of the significantly higher prevalence of complementary feeding practices in the former (+20%, p = 0.002). Conversely, the COVID-19 study group showed significantly higher EPDS scores (8.03 ± 4.88 vs. 8.03 ± 4.88, p < 0.005) and higher anhedonia (0.56 ± 0.65 vs. 0.18 ± 0.38, p < 0.001) and depression (0.62 ± 0.60 vs. 0.39 ± 0.44, <0.001) subscale scores. In the general linear model analysis, women practicing exclusive breastfeeding showed significantly lower EPDS scores in comparison with those practicing complementary (p = 0.003) and formula feedings (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the highest EPDS scores were observed in women adopting formula feeding, mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine (p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that hospital containment measures adopted during lockdown in the 'hotspot' COVID-19 epidemic area of Northeastern Italy have a detrimental effect on maternal emotions and on breastfeeding exclusivity practices.","Zanardo, Vincenzo; Tortora, Domenico; Guerrini, Pietro; Garani, Gianpaolo; Severino, Lorenzo; Soldera, Gino; Straface, Gianluca",Early Hum Dev,,250

360888,COVID-19 Cyber Security Threat Update,2020,"Background and purpose - COVID-19 is among the most impactful pandemics that the society has experienced. Orthopedic surgery involves procedures generating droplets and aerosols and there is concern amongst surgeons that otherwise rational precautionary principles are being set aside due to lack of scientific evidence and a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This narrative review attempts to translate relevant knowledge into practical recommendations for healthcare workers involved in orthopedic surgery on patients with known or suspected COVID-19.Patients and methods - We unsystematically searched in PubMed, reference lists, and the WHO's web page for relevant publications concerning problems associated with the PPE used in perioperative practice when a patient is COVID-19 positive or suspected to be. A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3.Results - Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice. Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks. Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown.Interpretation - Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available. Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important.","Basso, Trude; Dale, Håvard; Langvatn, Håkon; Lønne, Greger; Skråmm, Inge; Westberg, Marianne; Wik, Tina S; Witsø, Eivind",Acta Orthop,,250

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in plasma, bronchoalveolar aspirate (BAS) and CSF in two critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Remdesivir was administered at 200 mg loading dose on the first day followed by 12 days of 100 mg in two critically ill patients. Blood samples were collected immediately after (C0) and at 1 (C1) and 24 h (C24) after intravenous administration on day 3 until day 9. BAS samples were collected on Days 4, 7 and 9 from both patients while one CSF on Day 7 was obtained in one patient. Remdesivir and GS-441524 concentrations were measured in these samples using a validated UHPLC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: We observed higher concentrations of remdesivir at C0 (6- to 7-fold higher than EC50 from in vitro studies) and a notable decay at C1. GS-441524 plasma concentrations reached a peak at C1 and persisted until the next administration. Higher concentrations of GS-441524 were observed in the patient with mild renal dysfunction. Mean BAS/plasma concentration ratios of GS-441524 were 2.3% and 6.4% in Patient 1 and Patient 2, respectively. The CSF concentration found in Patient 2 was 25.7% with respect to plasma. GS-441524 levels in lung and CNS suggest compartmental differences in drug exposure.

Several guidelines were issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) for protection against the spread of coronavirus. According to WHO, the most effective preventive measure against COVID-19 is wearing a mask in public places and crowded areas. It is very difficult to monitor people manually in these areas. In this paper, a transfer learning model is proposed to automate the process of identifying the people who are not wearing mask. The proposed model is built by fine-tuning the pre-trained state-of-the-art deep learning model, InceptionV3. The proposed model is trained and tested on the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD). Image augmentation technique is adopted to address the limited availability of data for better training and testing of the model.

METHODS: Data on 24,034 patients screened for COVID-19 as of July 2020 were extracted from the Froedtert/Medical College of Wisconsin Epic medical record. COVID-19 outcomes were defined as positive screens, proportion hospitalized among positive screens, and proportion that died among positive and hospitalized population. The primary independent variable was a 3-category variable: physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone, and combined mental and physical health diagnoses. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the independent relationship between separate and combined diagnoses and COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Compared to physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis alone had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0.68, CI=0.51;0.92) and was not associated with hospitalization or mortality among positive screens. Combined had lower odds of screening positive (OR=0.78, CI=0.69;0.88) and higher odds of hospitalization among positive screens after adjusting for demographics (OR=1.58, CI=1.20;2.08) but lost significance in the fully adjusted model. No category of diagnoses was associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: Analysis is cross-sectional and cannot speak to any causal relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, compared to physical health diagnosis alone, mental health diagnosis and combined had lower odds of positive screens. However, individuals with combined were more likely to be hospitalized, after adjusting for demographics only. These findings add new evidence for risk of COVID-19 and related hospitalization in individuals who have a physical and mental health diagnosis.","Egede, Josh; Campbell, Jennifer A; Walker, Rebekah J; Garacci, Emma; Dawson, Aprill Z; Egede, Leonard E",J Affect Disord,,250

With the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many cases of ocular manifestation in association with this disease have been reported. However, as yet we have no complete understanding of this condition. We report here the first case of FBA in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with coexisting cytomegalovirus (CMV) and COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old Malay man with underlying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy was referred to the Opthalmology Department with complaints of blurry vision for the past 2 months. He had tested positive for and been diagnosed with COVID-19 1 month previously. Clinical examination of the fundus revealed extensive perivascular sheathing of both the artery and vein suggestive of FBA in the right eye. Laboratory testing of nasal swabs for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum CMV antibody were positive. The patient was then admitted to the COVID-19 ward and treated with intravenous ganciclovir. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of and take the necessary standard precautions for possible coexistence of COVID-19 in an immunocompromised patient presenting with blurred vision, eye redness, dry eye and foreign body sensation despite the absence of clinical features suggestive of COVID-19. Whether FBA is one of the ocular signs of co-infection of COVID-19 and CMV remains unknown.

The socio-sanitary rules imposed by the government concerned the social distance and management of intimate relationships, the sense of individual responsibility toward public health. Physical distancing and housing isolation have produced new representations of intrafamily, generational, neighborhood, community responsibility, bringing out a new ""medicalized dimension"" of society. In light of this contextual framework, the research aims are to analyze how: the perception of individual responsibility for public and familial health and physical distancing has redrawn the relation between subjects-family-community; the State's technical-health intervention has reformulated the idea of social closeness, but also how the pandemic fear and social confinement has re-evaluated a desire for community, neighborhood, proximity; during the lockdown families, friends, neighbors have reconstructed feelings of closeness and forms of belonging. The methodology used is quanti-qualitative and involved 300 women through an online questionnaire. The data collected highlight how the house during the lockdown is perceived as a safe place and how women implement both the recommendations and the behaviors aimed at preventing contagion, but also ways that allow coping with the situation from a perspective of well-being. Furthermore, the data show how the dimension of distancing has loosened the relational dimension outside the family unit, with a greater distancing compared to pre-pandemic data. However, the majority of women report that they have joined solidarity initiatives, demonstrating that they want to maintain ties and participate actively in community life.","Parisi, Rosa; Lagomarsino, Francesca; Rania, Nadia; Coppola, Ilaria",Front Public Health,,250

However, it has not been clarified how the aerosol dispersion, which has been assumed to be the leading transmission factor, could be reduced by masks which are specially designed for singers. Material and Methods12 professional singers (10 of the Bavarian Radio-Chorus and two freelancers, 7 females and 5 males) were asked to sing the melody of the ode of joy of Beethovens 9th symphony ""Freude schoner Gotterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium"" in D-major without masks and afterwards with five different singers masks, all distinctive in their material and proportions. Every task was conducted after inhaling the basic liquid from an e-cigarette. The aerosol dispersion was recorded by three high-definition video cameras during and after the task. The cloud was segmented and the dispersion was analyzed for all three spatial dimensions. Further, the subjects were asked to rate the practicability of wearing the tested masks during singing activities using a questionnaire. ResultsConcerning the median distances of dispersion, all masks were able to decrease the impulse dispersion of the aerosols to the front.

366444,[Post-COVID syndrome: A reflection and opinion paper]./ Síndrome post-COVID: Un documento de reflexión y opinión,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is seen as the biggest crisis since World War II. What started out as a public health issue, has quickly morphed into a political, economic, and societal crisis of epic proportions. Administrative capacity is a major factor in determining whether societies will emerge from this unprecedented situation with resilience and optimism, or despair and disconnectedness, and whether trust in government will increase or decrease. Autonomous and competent public managers are key producers of such administrative capacity. This paper addresses those public managers, the unsung administrative heroes leading us through times of crisis from behind the scenes. Translating the state of the art in public administration literature, with a particular emphasis on publications in this journal, into accessible practitioner recommendations, it identifies three key competencies paramount to public managers in times of crisis: managing stakeholders, political masters, and collaborative networks.

366706,COVID-19 and male fertility: Taking stock of one year after the outbreak began,2021,"Plant phenology differs largely among coexisting species within communities that share similar habitat conditions. However, the factors explaining such phenological diversity of plants have not been fully investigated. We hypothesize that species traits, including leaf mass per area (LMA), seed mass, stem tissue mass density (STD), maximum plant height (Hmax), and relative growth rate in height (RGRH), explain variation in plant phenology, and tested this hypothesis in an alpine meadow. Results showed that both LMA and STD were positively correlated with the onset (i.e., beginning) and offset (i.e., ending) times of the four life history events including two reproductive events (flowering and fruiting) and two vegetative events (leafing and senescing). In contrast, RGRH was negatively correlated with the four life phenological events. Moreover, Hmax was positively correlated with reproductive events but not with vegetative events. However, none of the eight phenological events was associated with seed size. In addition, the combination of LMA and STD accounted for 50% of the variation in plant phenologies. Phylogenetic generalized least squares analysis showed plant phylogeny weakened the relationships between species traits vs. phenologies. Phylogeny significantly regulated the variation in the ending but not the beginning of phenologies. Our results indicate that species traits are robust indicators for plant phenologies and can be used to explain the diversity of plant phenologies among co-occurring herbaceous species in grasslands. The findings highlight the important role of the combination of and trade-offs between functional traits in determing plant phenology diversity in the alpine meadow.","Liu, Yinzhan; Li, Guoyong; Wu, Xinwei; Niklas, Karl J; Yang, Zhongling; Sun, Shucun",Oecologia,,250

Phages of the Skunavirus genus are by far the most isolated lactococcal phages in the cheese environments and phage p2 is the model siphophage for this viral genus. The baseplate of phage p2, which is used to recognize its host, was previously shown to display two conformations by X-ray crystallography, a rested state and an activated state ready to bind to the host. The baseplate became only activated and opened in the presence of Ca2+. However, such an activated state was not previously observed in the virion. Here, using nanobodies binding to the baseplate, we report on the negative staining electron microscopy structure of the activated form of the baseplate directly observed in the p2 virion, that is compatible with the activated baseplate crystal structure. Analyses of this new structure also established the presence of a second distal tail (Dit) hexamer as a component of the baseplate, the topology of which differs largely from the first one. We also observed an uncoupling between the baseplate activation and the tail tip protein (Tal) opening, suggesting an infection mechanism more complex than previously expected.","Spinelli, Silvia; Tremblay, Denise; Moineau, Sylvain; Cambillau, Christian; Goulet, Adeline",Viruses,,250

Concerns regarding SARS-CoV- 2 transmission risk to research staff and overburdened institutional environments create challenges for standard event monitoring. In addition, safety or outcome events often occur at other institutions rather than the enrollment site. Therefore, research methodology was adapted to effectively evaluate and categorize safety events using a remote low touch approach. Methods Trial over can be found at NCT04498273. Potential adverse events identified through patient electronic data capture survey or call center assessments are handled remotely by central clinical study staff. If an event is identified as a possible endpoint or SAE by the central study staff the electronic data collection (EDC) system notifies the central medical monitoring team, and the enrolling site coordinator if patient enrolled from an acute care setting, that additional source documents are necessary. The medical coordinator works with the site coordinator, or will reach out independently to treating institutions to obtain necessary source documents. Based on a review of clinical data from the EDC and all available source documents, final arbitration of seriousness, relatedness and expectedness is be made by the study's Medical Monitor, and appropriate study entities (NIH, FDA, IRB, study leadership, pharmaceutical co.) are notified.Results The process as described has been successfully and effectively implemented in &gt;50 patients with anticipation of 7000 patient eventual enrollment. Events have been captured, source documentation has been procured and events have been reported as per established protocol processes. Conclusion We have effectively implemented a medical safety event monitoring methodology in a “low touch” study design to assess events in the complex COVID-19 outpatient space. Elements of our system can be effectively replicated in other COVID and non-COVID clinical trials. .","Hulbert, J. C.; Krishnan, J.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with higher severity and mortality of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of comorbidities and medications in addition to determining the association between AKI, antibiotics against coinfections (AAC) and outcomes of patients. We conducted a retrospective study on adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a tertiary center. Our primary outcomes were the incidence rate of AKI based on comorbidities and medications. The secondary outcome was to determine mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged hospitalization by AKI and AAC. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression method was used to explore predictive effects of AKI and AAC on outcomes. Out of 854 included participants, 118 patients developed AKI in whom, 57 used AAC and 61 did not. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities in patients developed AKI. AAC, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and corticosteroids had significant higher rate of administration in patients developed AKI. AAC were associated with higher deaths (odds ratio [OR] = 5.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3-8.78) and ICU admission (OR = 5.87; 95%CI: 2.81-12.27), while AKI had higher OR for prolonged hospitalization (3.37; 95%CI: 1.76-6.45). Both AKI and AAC are associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19. Defining strict criteria regarding indications and types of antibiotics would help overcoming concomitant infections and minimizing related adverse events.","Mousavi Movahed, Seyed Majid; Akhavizadegan, Hamed; Dolatkhani, Fatemeh; Nejadghaderi, Seyed Aria; Aghajani, Faezeh; Faghir Gangi, Monireh; Ghazi, Zahra; Ghasemi, Hoomaan",J Med Virol,,250
368763,Currency Risk Management and Covid 19,2020,"Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are regularly complicated by respiratory failure. Although it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n = 94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n = 32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, P < 0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","Shi, Hui; Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Blair, Christopher; Woodward, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Woods, Robert J; Lood, Christian; Knight, Jason S; Kanthi, Yogendra",J Leukoc Biol,,250

Paediatric services in particular required adjustment, not only for the paediatric patients but also for their carers and the staff looking after them. Strategies were divided into streams, including the impact of COVID-19 on the hospital and the role of RCWMCH in Western Cape Province, communication strategies, adaptation of clinical services at the hospital, specifically with a paediatric-friendly approach, and staff engagement. Interventions utilised: (i) Specific COVID-19 planning was required at a children's hospital, and lessons were learnt from other international children's hospitals. A similar number of patients and staff were infected by the virus (244 patients and 212 staff members by 21 December 2020). (ii) Measures were put in place to assist creation of capacity at metro hospitals' adult services by accepting children with emergency issues directly to RCWMCH, as well as accepting adolescents up to age 18 years. (iii) The communication strategy was improved to include daily engagement with heads of departments/supervisors by earlymorning structured information meetings. There were also changes in the methods of communication with staff using media such as Zoom, MS Teams and WhatsApp. Hospital-wide information and discussion sessions were held both on social platforms and in the form of smallgroup physical meetings with senior hospital administrators (with appropriate distancing). Labour union representatives were purposefully directly engaged to assess concerns. (iv) Clinical services at the hospital were adapted. These included paediatric-friendly services and physical changes to the hospital environment. (v) Staff engagement was particularly important to assist in allaying staff anxiety, developing a staff screening programme, and provision and training in use of personal protective equipment, as well as focusing on staff wellness. In conclusion, visible management and leadership has allowed for flexibility and adaptability to manage clinical services in various contexts. It is important to utilise staff in different roles during a crisis and to consider the different perspectives of people involved in the services. The key to success, that included very early adoption of the above measures, has been hospital staff taking initiative, searching for answers and identifying and implementing solutions, effective communication, and leadership support. These lessons are useful in dealing with second and further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Parbhoo, A N; Numanoglu, A; Argent, A C; Franken, M; Mukosi, M; McCulloch, M I",S Afr Med J,,250

369892,COVID-19 disparity among Black Americans: A call to action for nurse scientists,2020,"One of the most crucial characteristic traits of Envelope (E) proteins in the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-1 and NCOVID19 viruses is their membrane-associated oligomerization led ion channel activity, virion assembly, and replication. NMR spectroscopic structural studies of envelope proteins from both the SARS CoV-1/2 reveal that this protein assembles into a homopentamer. Proof of concept studies via truncation mutants on either transmembrane (VFLLV), glycosylation motif (CACCN), hydrophobic helical bundle (PVYVY) as well as replacing C-terminal ""DLLV"" segments or point mutants such as S68, E69 residues with cysteine have significantly reduced viral titers of SARS-CoV-1. In this present study, we have first developed SARS-2 E protein homology model based on the pentamer coordinates of SARS-CoV-1 E protein (86.4% structural identity) with good stereochemical quality. Next, we focused on the glycosylation motif and hydrophobic helical bundle regions of E protein shown to be important for viral replication. A four feature (4F) model comprising of an acceptor targeting S60 hydroxyl group, a donor feature anchoring the C40 residue, and two hydrophobic features anchoring the V47 L28, L31, Y55, and P51 residues formed the protein based pharmacophore model targeting the glycosylation motif and helical bundle of E protein. Database screening with this 4F protein pharmacophore, ADMET property filtering on enamine small molecule discovery collection yielded a focused library of ~7000 hits. Further molecular docking and visual inspection of docked pose interactions at the above mention V47 L28, L31, Y55, P51, S60, C40 residues led to the identification of 10 best hits. Our STD NMR binding assay results demonstrate that the ligand 3, 2-(2-amino-2-oxo-ethoxy)-N-benzyl-benzamide, binds to NCOVID19 E protein with a binding affinity (KD) of 141.7 ± 13.6 µM. Furthermore, the ligand 3 also showed binding to C-terminal peptide (NR25) as evidenced with the STD spectrums of wild type E protein would serve to confirm the involvement of C-terminal helical bundle as envisaged in this study.","Mukherjee, Shruti; Harikishore, Amaravadhi; Bhunia, Anirban",Int J Biol Macromol,,250

There has been a great effort worldwide to contain the virus and to search for an effective treatment for patients who become critically ill with COVID-19. A promising therapeutic compound currently undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19 is nitric oxide (NO), which is a free radical that has been previously reported to inhibit the replication of several DNA and RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. Although NO has potent antiviral activity, it has a complex role in the immunological host responses to viral infections, i.e., it can be essential for pathogen control or detrimental for the host, depending on its concentration and the type of virus. In this Essay, the antiviral role of NO against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other human viruses is highlighted, current development of NO-based therapies used in the clinic is summarized, existing challenges are discussed and possible further developments of NO to fight viral infections are suggested.","Lisi, Fabio; Zelikin, Alexander N; Chandrawati, Rona",Adv Sci (Weinh),,250

This pandemic has become a disaster since the spreading rate from person to person is incredibly high and many techniques have come forth to aid in stopping the infection. Although various types of methods have been put into implementation, the search and suggestions of new approaches to reduce the increasing rate of infection will never come to an end until a vaccine terminates this pandemic. This study focuses on proposing a new framework that is based on Deep Learning algorithms for recognizing the COVID-19 cases, mostly in public places. The algorithms include Background Subtraction for extracting the foreground of thermal images from thermal videos generated by Thermal Cameras through the Thermal Imaging process and the Convolutional Neural Network for detecting people infected with the virus. This automated prototype works in a real-time scenario that helps identify people with the disease and will try to trace it while separating them from having any other contact. This proposal intends to achieve a satisfying growth in determining the real cases of COVID-19 and minimize the spreading rate of this virus to the max, ultimately avoiding more deaths.","Peddinti, Bharati; Shaikh, Amir; K R, Bhavya; K C, Nithin Kumar",Biomed Signal Process Control,,250

375102,Tourism and COVID-19 intimacy transformed or intimacy interrupted?,2020,"Here we show for the first time that the plasticity in morphology and duration of yawning in Macaca tonkeana can be associated with different functional contexts. Macaca tonkeana is classified as a tolerant macaque species characterized by social interactions minimally constrained by dominance rank or kinship. Tonkean macaques, as other egalitarian species, rely on a complex facial communicative system. We found that the degree of mouth opening (ranging from covered to uncovered tooth yawns) and the duration of yawning were not strictly dependent. The shortest uncovered tooth yawns were associated with an intense locomotor/physical activity and peaked immediately after stressful social events thus indicating an increase in arousal. In contrast, longer yawns, independently from teeth exposure, were primarily associated with a relaxed state of the subject. In conclusion, our study suggests that to explore the potential different functions of yawning, it is necessary to focus on the variability of its expression both in terms of morphology and duration, because not all yawns tell the same story.","Zannella, Alessandra; Stanyon, Roscoe; Maglieri, Veronica; Palagi, Elisabetta",Am J Primatol,,250

STUDY DESIGN: The study comprised 52 children with MIS-C admitted to University of Health Sciences Adana City Training and Research Hospital pediatric wards from September 2020 to April 2021. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were retrospectively collected from patient files. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 9 (5-13) years. Fever (92.3%), abdominal pain (76.9%), rash (48.1%) and vomiting (48.1%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Fever duration was 8 (4.25-10) days in overall. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 17.3% of patients. At admission, elevated levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, D-dimer and ferritin were found in 98.1%, 96.2%, 75%, 84.6% and 69.2% of the patients, respectively. Lymphopenia, hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia were found in 76.9%, 59.6% and 42.3% of the patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 96.2%, corticosteroids in 71.2% and anakinra in 3.8% of the patients. In total, 28.8% of the patients were admitted to pediatric intensive care unit and 17.3% received vasopressor support. Median duration of hospital length of stay was 12.5 days. Comorbidities were present in 19.2% of the patients. No mortality was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: While being rare and treatable, MIS-C is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. The increasing number of MIS-C cases shows that this phenomenon is more common than thought. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly. LAY SUMMARY: While being rare and treatable, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. MIS-C is now thought to be a post-infectious (SARS-CoV2) hyperinflammatory disease secondary to an abnormal immune response, rather than a complete obscurity. The increasing number of MIS-C cases and new case series reports from all over the world show that MIS-C is more common than thought. Despite our increasing experience, we may encounter a new finding every day in MIS-C patients. Therefore, we want to contribute to literature by presenting the MIS-C cases we treated in our clinic in detail. We have experienced that MIS-C patients can apply with similar but also different and unique characteristics. In case of delayed diagnosis or treatment, morbidity and mortality rates may increase. Therefore, the level of awareness and knowledge of all physicians, especially those dealing with pediatric patients, about MIS-C should be increased. Although the early effects of MIS-C are known, we don't have enough information about the long-term consequences yet. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly.","Tolunay, Orkun; Çelik, Ümit; Arslan, Ilknur; Orgun, Ali; Demir, Hüsnü; Demir, Oguzhan; Dagdelen, Erdi Çagri",J. trop. pedriatr,,250

METHODS: This study included 80 patients hospitalised and treated for COVID-19 in the infectious diseases clinic between March 2020 and May 2020. Data analysis was performed retrospectively from the hospital medical charts. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings were noted. Clinical symptoms and correlations with laboratory results were assessed. Besides, an analysis of patients with and without chronic disease was performed for clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. RESULTS: The frequencies of myalgia and fatigue were 46.1% and 50%, respectively. In the laboratory data, there was a significant increase in creatinine kinase (CK) level and lymphocyte count in the patients with myalgia symptoms (P < .05). There were no other significant results in the laboratory data. Of the patients with chronic disease, it has been shown that hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased (P < .05), while D-dimer was markedly increased (P < .05).

379334,Curating Covid-19 data in Links,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is higher than usual. Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then, we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression or anxiety for patients who scored &#8805;7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at five sites were randomized into two groups: cCBT + treatment as usual (TAU; n=126) and TAU without cCBT (n=126). The cCBT + TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD17 and HAMA scores. The secondary outcome measures were the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Assessments were carried out pre- and postintervention. The patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression in one of the centers were assessed again within 1 month after the postintervention assessment. RESULTS: The cCBT + TAU group displayed a significantly decreased score on the HAMD17, HAMA, SDS, SAS, and AIS after the intervention compared to the TAU group (all P<.001). A mixed-effects repeated measures model revealed significant improvement in symptoms of depression (HAMD17 and SDS scores, both P<.001), anxiety (HAMA and SAS scores, both P<.001), and insomnia (AIS score, P=.002) during the postintervention and follow-up periods in the cCBT + TAU group. Additionally, the improvement of insomnia among females (P=.14) and those with middle school education (P=.48) in the cCBT + TAU group showed no significant differences when compared to the TAU group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the cCBT program we developed was an effective nonpharmacological treatment for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among patients with COVID-19. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects of cCBT for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-COV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. FINDINGS: Of the139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8 %, 48.0 %, and 95.8 % of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and >2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3 %, 8.0 %, and 62.5 %, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4 % (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3 % (55/74) and 82.4 % (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","Imai, Kazuo; Tabata, Sakiko; Ikeda, Mayu; Noguchi, Sakiko; Kitagawa, Yutaro; Matuoka, Masaru; Miyoshi, Kazuyasu; Tarumoto, Norihito; Sakai, Jun; Ito, Toshimitsu; Maesaki, Shigefumi; Tamura, Kaku; Maeda, Takuya",J Clin Virol,,250
379943,"Haunting juxtapositions: gender, Covid-19, and the conservative modern",2021,"Homosalate (HMS) is a salicylate molecule that is commonly included within commercial sunscreen formulations to provide protection from the adverse effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. In the present work, the mechanisms by which HMS provides UV photoprotection are unravelled, using a multi-pronged approach involving a combination of time-resolved ultrafast laser spectroscopy in the gas-phase and in solution, laser-induced fluorescence, steady-state absorption spectroscopy, and computational methods. The unique combination of these techniques allow us to show that the enol tautomer of HMS undergoes ultrafast excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) upon photoexcitation in the UVB (290-320 nm) region; once in the keto tautomer, the excess energy is predominantly dissipated non-radiatively.

However, even among developed nations, access to TAVI is not uniform. The Valve for Life initiative was launched by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions in 2015 with the objective of improving access to transcatheter valve interventions across Europe. The UK has been identified as a country with low penetration of these procedures and has been selected as the fourth nation to be included in the initiative. Specifically, the number of TAVI procedures carried out in the UK is significantly lower than almost all other European nations. Furthermore, there is substantial geographical inequity in access to TAVI within the UK. As a consequence of this underprovision, waiting times for TAVI are long, and mortality among those waiting intervention is significant. This article reviews these issues, reports new data on access to TAVI in the UK and presents the proposals of the UK Valve for Life team to address the current problems in association with the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society.","Ali, Noman; Faour, Amir; Rawlins, John; Dawkins, Sam; Appleby, Clare E; MacCarthy, Philip; Byrne, Jonathan; Trivedi, Uday; Curzen, Nick; Banning, Adrian P; Ludman, Peter; Blackman, Daniel J",,,250

Prior research indicates that human mobility is one of the key factors involved in viral spreading. Indeed, in a connected planet, rapid world-wide spread is enabled by long-distance air-, land- and sea-transportation among countries and continents, and subsequently fostered by commuting trips within densely populated cities. While early travel restrictions contribute to delayed disease spread, their utility is much reduced if the disease has a long incubation period or if there is asymptomatic transmission. Given the lack of vaccines, public health officials have mainly relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, including social distancing measures, curfews, and stay-at-home orders. Here we study the impact of city organization on its susceptibility to disease spread, and amenability to interventions. Cities can be classified according to their mobility in a spectrum between compact-hierarchical and decentralized-sprawled. Our results show that even though hierarchical cities are more susceptible to the rapid spread of epidemics, their organization makes mobility restrictions quite effective. Conversely, sprawled cities are characterized by a much slower initial spread, but are less responsive to mobility restrictions. These findings hold globally across cities in diverse geographical locations and a broad range of sizes. Our empirical measurements are confirmed by a simulation of COVID-19 spread in urban areas through a compartmental model. These results suggest that investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hoc interventions in more vulnerable cities may prove most helpful in containing and reducing the impact of present and future pandemics.","Aguilar, Javier; Bassolas, Aleix; Ghoshal, Gourab; Hazarie, Surendra; Kirkley, Alec; Mazzoli, Mattia; Meloni, Sandro; Mimar, Sayat; Nicosia, Vincenzo; Ramasco, Jose J.; Sadilek, Adam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15367v1.pdf,250

We seek to examine the impact of clinical variables such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) on mortality and need for intubation, as well as demographic variables such as age, sex, and race on persons with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. METHODS: Analyses were conducted on 4413 patients with an International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test to compare subgroup analyses. RESULTS: In this multivariate analysis, male gender, older age, and hyperglycemia at admission were associated with increased mortality and intubation, but this was not seen for race, ethnicity, insurance type, or HbA1c. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, having comorbid conditions such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic levels at admission have a greater impact on health outcomes than HbA1c. Older men and those with comorbid disease are also at greater risk for mortality. Further longitudinal studies need to be done to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on type 2 diabetes.","Myers, Alyson K; Kim, Tara S; Zhu, Xu; Liu, Yan; Qiu, Michael; Pekmezaris, Renee",J. diabetes (Online),,250
383580,Critical data analysis of COVID-19 spreading in Indonesia to measure the readiness of new-normal policy,2020-11-16,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has rapidly spread worldwide from the beginning of 2020. The presence of viral RNA in samples by nucleic acid (NA) molecular analysis is the only method available to diagnose COVID-19 disease and to assess patients' viral load. Since the demand for laboratory reagents has increased, there has been a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. We, therefore, developed a fast and cost-effective viral genome isolation method that, combined with quantitative RT-PCR assay, detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient samples. The method relies on the addition of Proteinase K followed by a controlled heat-shock incubation and, then, E gene evaluation by RT-qPCR. It was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and precision. It detects as low as 10 viral copies/sample, is rapid, and has been characterized in 60 COVID-19-infected patients. Compared to automated extraction methods, our pretreatment guarantees the same positivity rate with the advantage of shortening the time of the analysis and reducing its cost. This is a rapid workflow meant to aid the healthcare system in the rapid identification of infected patients, such as during a pathogen-related outbreak. For its intrinsic characteristics, this workflow is suitable for large-scale screenings.","Mio, Catia; Cifù, Adriana; Marzinotto, Stefania; Bergamin, Natascha; Caldana, Chiara; Cattarossi, Silvia; Cmet, Sara; Cussigh, Annarosa; Martinella, Romina; Zucco, Jessica; Verardo, Roberto; Schneider, Claudio; Marcon, Barbara; Zampieri, Stefania; Pipan, Corrado; Curcio, Francesco",Dis Markers,,250

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used National Heart Failure Audit data to identify 36 974 adults who had a hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of heart failure between February and May in either 2018, 2019, or 2020. Hospital admissions for heart failure in 2018/19 averaged 160/day but were much lower in 2020, reaching a nadir of 64/day on 27 March 2020 [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.42]. The proportion discharged on guideline-recommended pharmacotherapies was similar in 2018/19 compared to the same period in 2020. Between 1 February-2020 and 31 May 2020, there was a 29% decrease in hospital deaths related to heart failure (IRR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.67-0.75; estimated decline of 448 deaths), a 31% increase in heart failure deaths at home (IRR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.24-1.39; estimated excess 539), and a 28% increase in heart failure deaths in care homes and hospices (IRR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18-1.40; estimated excess 189). All-cause, inpatient death was similar in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods [odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% CI: 0.94-1.10].

The present study was carried out to give an insight of therapeutic interventional trials registered under clinical trial registry of India (CTRI) for COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All trials registered under CTRI were evaluated using keyword ""COVID"" from its inception till 9th June 2020. Out of which, therapeutic interventional studies were chosen for further analysis. Following information was collected for each trial: type of therapeutic intervention (preventive/therapeutic), treatment given, no. of centers (single center/multicentric), type of institution (government/private), study design (randomized/single-blinded/double-blinded) and sponsors (Government/private). Microsoft Office Excel 2007 was used for tabulation and analysis. RESULTS: The search yielded total of 205 trials, out of which, 127 (62%) trials were interventional trials. Out of these, 71 (56%) were AYUSH interventions, 36 (28.3%) tested drugs, 9 (7%) tested a nondrug intervention, rest were nutraceuticals and vaccines. About 66 (56%) were therapeutic trials. Majority were single-centered trials, i.e. 87 (73.7%). Trials were government funded in 57 (48.3%) studies. Majority were randomized controlled trials, i.e. 67 (56.8%). AYUSH preparations included AYUSH-64, Arsenic Album, SamshamaniVati etc. CONCLUSIONS: The number of therapeutic interventional clinical trials was fair in India. A clear-cut need exists for an increase in both quantity and quality of clinical trials for COVID-19.

An impressive positive trajectory of advances in patient care and research faced sudden global disruptions by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and by an international movement protesting racial, socioeconomic, and health disparities. The disruptions revealed obstacles and fragility within the pediatric neurology research mission. However, renewed commitment offers unique opportunities for the pediatric neurology research community to enhance and prioritize research directions for the coming decades. METHODS: The Research Committee of the Child Neurology Society evaluated the challenges and opportunities facing the pediatric neurology research field, including reviewing published literature, synthesizing publically available data, and conducting a survey of pediatric neurologists. RESULTS: We identified three priority domains for the research mission: funding levels, active guidance, and reducing disparities. Funding levels: to increase funding to match the burden of pediatric neurological disease; to tailor funding mechanisms and strategies to support clinical trial efforts unique to pediatric neurology; and to support investigators across their career trajectory. Active guidance: to optimize infrastructure and strategies, to leverage novel therapeutics, enhance data collection, and improve inclusion of children in clinical trials. Reducing disparities: to reduce health disparities in children with neurological disease, to develop proactive measures to enhance workforce diversity and inclusion, and increase avenues to balance work-life obligations for investigators.

One of the areas that has received little attention amid this turmoil is the disruption to trainee education, particularly in specialties that involve acquisition of procedural skills. Hand surgery in Singapore is a standalone combined programme that relies heavily on dedicated cross-hospital rotations, an extensive didactic curriculum and supervised hands-on training of increasing complexity. All aspects of this training programme have been affected because of the cancellation of elective surgical procedures, suspension of cross-hospital rotations, redeployment of residents, and an unsustainable duty roster. There is a real concern that trainees will not be able to meet their training requirements and suffer serious issues like burnout and depression. The long-term impact of suspending training indefinitely is a severe disruption of essential medical services. This article examines the impact of a global pandemic on trainee education in a demanding surgical speciality. We have outlined strategies to maintain trainee competencies based on the following considerations: 1) the safety and wellbeing of trainees is paramount; 2) resource utilization must be thoroughly rationalized; 3) technology and innovative learning methods must supplant traditional teaching methods; and 4) the changes implemented must be sustainable. We hope that these lessons will be valuable to other training programs struggling to deliver quality education to their trainees, even as we work together to battle this global catastrophe.","Das De, Soumen; Puhaindran, Mark E; Sechachalam, Sreedharan; Wong, Kevin Jian Hao; Chong, Chew Wei; Chin, Andrew Yuan Hui",Bone Jt Open,,250
386959,A new road map for our nation’s response to covid-19,2020,"Coaches are an integral part of talent identification in sport and are often used as the ""gold standard"" against which scientific methods of talent identification are compared. However, their decision-making during this process is not well understood. In this article, we use an ecological approach to explore talent identification in combat sports. We interviewed twenty-four expert, international-level coaches from the Olympic disciplines of boxing, judo, and taekwondo (age: 48.7 + 7.5 years; experience: 20.8 + 8.3 years). Findings indicated that when coaches identify talent they rely on ""gut instinct"": intuitive judgements made without conscious thought, used to direct attention to particular athletes or characteristics. Our analysis revealed four major contributors to coaches' intuition: experiential knowledge, temporal factors, seeing athletes in context, and what can be worked with. Our findings demonstrate that i) athlete selections may be influenced by the coaches' perceived ability to improve certain athletes (rather than solely on athlete ability); and ii) ""instinctual"" decisions are the result of years of experience, time spent with the athlete, and the context surrounding the decision. Based on these findings, we recommend that future research focuses on the duration and conditions that are required for coaches to confidently and reliably identify talented athletes.","Roberts, Alexandra H; Greenwood, Daniel; Stanley, Mandy; Humberstone, Clare; Iredale, Fiona; Raynor, Annette",J Sports Sci,,250
387032,"Quantifying The Relationship Between Lockdowns, Mobility, and Effective Reproduction Number (Rt) During The COVID-19 Pandemic in The Greater Toronto Area",2021,"Background We considered the extent of the contribution of publicly funded research to the late-stage clinical development of pharmaceuticals and medicinal products, based on the European Commission (EC) FP7 research funding programme. Using two EC FP7-HEALTH case study examples—representing two types of outcomes—we then estimated wider public and charitable research funding contributions. Methods Using the publicly available database of FP7-HEALTH funded projects, we identified awards relating to late-stage clinical development according to the systematic application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, classified them according to product type and clinical indication, and calculated total EC funding amounts. We then identified two case studies representing extreme outcomes: failure to proceed with the product (hepatitis C vaccine) and successful market authorisation (Orfadin® for alkaptonuria). Total public and philanthropic research funding contributions to these products were then estimated using publicly available information on funding. Results 12.3% (120/977) of all EC FP7-HEALTH awards related to the funding of late-stage clinical research, totalling € 686,871,399. Pharmaceutical products and vaccines together accounted for 84% of these late-stage clinical development research awards and 70% of its funding. The hepatitis C vaccine received total European Community (FP7 and its predecessor, EC Framework VI) funding of €13,183,813;total public and charitable research funding for this product development was estimated at € 77,060,102. The industry sponsor does not consider further development of this product viable;this now represents public risk investment. FP7 funding for the late-stage development of Orfadin® for alkaptonuria was so important that the trials it funded formed the basis for market authorisation, but it is not clear whether the price of the treatment (over €20,000 per patient per year) adequately reflects the substantial public funding contribution. Conclusions Public and charitable research funding plays an essential role, not just in early stage basic research, but also in the late-stage clinical development of products prior to market authorisation. In addition, it provides risk capital for failed products. Within this context, we consider further discussions about a public return on investment and its reflection in pricing policies and decisions justified.","Schmidt, L.; Sehic, O.; Wild, C.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice,,250
387137,How did regular sports bettors behave during covid-19 lockdown? Evidence from Poland,2021,"Background: As an emerging infectious disease, COVID-19 has garnered great research interest We aimed to explore the differences between English language and Chinese language Medical/Scientific journals publications, particularly aiming to explore the efficacy/contents of the literature published in English and Chinese in relation to the outcomes of management and characterization of COVID-19 during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic Methods: Publications on COVID-19 research were retrieved from both English and Chinese databases Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOSviewer 1 6 14, and CiteSpace V software Network maps were generated to evaluate the collaborations between different authors, countries/provinces, and institutions Results: A total of 143 English and 721 Chinese original research articles and reviews on COVID-19 were included in our study Most of the authors and institutions of the papers were from China before March 1st, 2020, however, the distribution of authors and institutions were mainly in developed countries or more wealthy areas of China The range of the keywords in English publications was more extensive than those in Chinese Traditional Chinese Medicine was seen more frequently in Chinese papers than in English Of the 143 articles published in English, 54 articles were published by Chinese authors only and 21 articles were published jointly by Chinese and other overseas authors Conclusions: The publications in English have enabled medical practitioners and scientists to share/exchange information, while on the other hand, the publications in the Chinese language have provided complementary educational approaches for the local medical practitioners to understand the essential and key information to manage COVID-19 in the relatively remote regions of China, for the general population with a general level of education","Fan, J.; Gao, Y.; Zhao, N.; Dai, R.; Zhang, H.; Feng, X.; Shi, G.; Tian, J.; Chen, C.; Hambly, B.

387138,How did regular sports bettors behave during covid-19 lockdown? Evidence from Poland,2021,"In this study conducted during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, I explored how trait morbid curiosity was related to interest in 1) factual information about Coronavirus that was specifically morbid;2) general factual information about Coronavirus;3) pandemic and virus genres of films and TV shows;and 4) genres of film and TV shows that center around threat more broadly. Participants (n = 125) who scored high in morbid curiosity reported increased interest, compared to usual, in pandemic/virus genres as well as horror and thriller genres. Morbidly curious participants were also more interested specifically in morbid information about Coronavirus. Furthermore, disgust sensitivity was unrelated to these preferences. These results provide initial evidence that trait morbid curiosity can predict particular media preferences in the face of a real threat, and that morbid curiosity may reflect an adaptive predisposition in some individuals toward learning about the dangerous and disgusting aspects of a threat.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved third- and fourth-year pharmacy students at the International Islamic University Malaysia. A validated self-administered questionnaire was distributed to students who had taken a vOSCE a week before. RESULTS: Out of the 253 students who were approached, 231 (91.3%) completed the questionnaire. More than 75% of the participants agreed that the instructions and preparations were clear and helpful in familiarizing them with the vOSCE flow. It was found that 53.2% of the respondents were satisfied with the flow and conduct of the vOSCE. However, only approximately one-third of the respondents believed that the tasks provided in the vOSCE were more convenient, less stressful, and easier to perform than those in the conventional OSCE. Furthermore, 49.7% of the students favored not having a vOSCE in the future when conducting a conventional OSCE becomes feasible again. Internet connection was reported as a problem hindering the performance of the vOSCE by 51.9% of the participants. Students who were interested in clinical pharmacy courses were more satisfied than other students with the preparation and operation of the vOSCE, the faculty support, and the allocated time. CONCLUSION: Students were satisfied with the organization and operation of the vOSCE. However, they still preferred the conventional OSCE over the vOSCE. These findings might indicate a further need to expose students to telehealthcare models.","Elnaem, Mohamed Hassan; Akkawi, Muhammad Eid; Nazar, Nor Ilyani Mohamed; Ab Rahman, Norny Syafinaz; Mohamed, Mohamad Haniki Nik",J Educ Eval Health Prof,,250

The information highlighted in the article was gathered from fishermen, fishing industry experts, health and safety advisors, and advocates. From these first-hand accounts, we provide the immediate and expansive impacts of COVID-19 on fishermen's health and wellbeing. In particular, we discuss the economic impact of COVID-19 market disruptions, as well as the very real, logistical challenges of protecting workers on fishing vessels. We also provide examples of how these combined issues have led to increased occupational risk in one of the nation's most deadly industries. Lastly, we identify a number of recommendations for providing much-needed support for commercial fishermen in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sorensen, Julie; Echard, Jessica; Weil, Rebecca",J Agromedicine,,250

With COVID-19 exploding in the US, the US Geological Survey decided to recruit 31 scientists to assess the risk that SARS-CoV-2 could infect North American bats, according to Kevin Olival, a disease ecologist with EcoHealth Alliance (New York, NY) and the lead author of the study","Pelley, Janet",Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment,,250
390348,Covid-19 and doctoral research in Brazil and Portugal: Who pays the bill for confinement and remote work in research?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Developing a safe and effective vaccine will be the principal way of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, current COVID-19 vaccination trials are not adequately representing a diverse participant population in terms of age, ethnicity and comorbidities. Achieving the representative recruitment targets that are adequately powered to the study remains one of the greatest challenges in clinical trial management. To ensure accuracy and generalisability of the safety and efficacy conclusions generated by clinical trials, it is crucial to recruit patient cohorts as representative as possible of the future target population. Missing these targets can lead to reduced validity of the study results and can often slow down drug development leading to costly delays. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the key factors related to perceptions and participation in vaccination trials. METHODS: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK. Statistical analysis was done in six phases. Multi-nominal logistic models examined demographic and geographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. RESULTS: The survey had 4884 participants of which 9.44% were Black Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME). Overall, 2020 (41.4%) respondents were interested in participating in vaccine trials; 27.6% of the respondents were not interested and 31.1% were unsure. The most interested groups were male (OR = 1.29), graduates (OR = 1.28), the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups (OR = 1.88 and OR = 1.46 respectively) and those with no health issues (OR = 1.06). The least interested groups were BAME (OR = 0.43), those from villages and small towns (OR = 0.66 and 0.54 respectively) and those aged 70 and above (OR = 1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In order to have a vaccination that is generalisable to the entire population, greater work needs to be done in engaging a diverse cohort of participants. Public health campaigns need to be targeted in improving trial recruitment rates for the elderly, BAME community and the less educated rural population.","Sethi, Sonika; Kumar, Aditi; Mandal, Anandadeep; Shaikh, Mohammed; Hall, Claire A; Kirk, Jeremy M W; Moss, Paul; Brookes, Matthew J; Basu, Supratik",Trials,,250

391129,Facilitating Test Status Information Communication in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if tobacco use in patients with Covid-19 is associated with a negative disease course and adverse outcome, and if smoking, current and past, is associated with a greater possibility of developing COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) of previously published works were performed. The search strategy included all known descriptors for Covid-19 and tobacco and was conducted in different databases. Appropriate statistical models were used to address the effect size in meta-analysis, namely random effects and fixed effects model. RESULTS: Thirty-four articles were identified in the SR of which 19 were included in the MA. Being a smoker or former smoker was shown to be a risk factor for worse progression of Covid-19 infection (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 - 2.83) and a greater probability of presenting a more critical condition (OR 1.79 95% CI, 1.19 - 2.70). As limitations of the MA, we found that most of the studies analyzed were observational with limited publication bias. Two studies that disagreed with the rest were included, although after withdrawing them from the MA, smoking was maintained as a risk factor for worse progress. CONCLUSION: Current and past smoking produces a more serious clinical form of Covid-19 and more frequently leads to intensive care admission, intubation, and death.","Jiménez-Ruiz, Carlos A; López-Padilla, Daniel; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael; Solano-Reina, Segismundo; de Granda-Orive, José Ignacio",Arch. bronconeumol.

METHOD: This was a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence cross-sectional study in risk-stratified HCWs randomly selected from three main district hospitals in Oman. RESULTS: 1078 HCWs were included, with an overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 21%. The seropositivity rates in low-, variable-, and high-risk groups were 29%, 18%, and 17%, respectively (p-value < 0.001). The study found higher positivity in males (crude odds ratio [COR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-2.3), and workers residing in high-prevalence areas (COR 2.09, 95% CI 1.42-3.07). Compared with doctors, workers from supporting services, administration staff, and nurses were more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (COR 9.81, 95% CI 5.26-18.27; 2.37, 95% CI 1.23-4.58; 2.08 95% CI 1.14-3.81). The overall rate of previously undetected infection was 12%, with higher values in low-risk HCWs. High district prevalence was a driving factor for seropositivity in the low-risk group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.36, 95% CI 1.0-5.59). CONCLUSION: Low-risk supporting services workers can drive SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospitals. More attention and innovation within this area will enhance the safety of health care during epidemics/pandemics.","Al-Maani, Amal; Al Wahaibi, Adil; Al-Sooti, Jabir; Al Abri, Bader; Al Shukri, Intisar; AlRisi, Elham; Al Abri, Laila; AlDaghari, Khalid; Al Subhi, Mahmood; AlMaqbali, Salima; AlBurtamani, Salim; AlAbri, Asma; Al Salami, Ahmed; Al-Beloushi, Iman; Al-Zadjali, Najla; Alqayoudhi, Abdullah; Al-Kindi, Hanan; Al Shaqsi, Khalifa; Al-Jardani, Amina; Al-Abri, Seif",Int J Infect Dis,,250

Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in a state of immunosuppression may be considered at risk for complications in the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is increasing evidence postulating a possible protective role of selective immunosuppression. One group of such immunosuppressants used in MS comprises the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) ocrelizumab and rituximab. Anti-CD20 mAbs bind to the surface of B cells, causing their depletion. We describe our experience in seven cases of patients with multiple sclerosis who have been affected by SARS-COV-2 (with a clinical/serological diagnosis or PCR diagnosis) and who were being treated with anti-CD20+ monoclonal antibodies.

Governments have responded by restricting human movement, which has reduced economic activity. These changes may benefit biodiversity conservation in some ways, but in Africa, we contend that the net conservation impacts of COVID-19 will be strongly negative. Here, we describe how the crisis creates a perfect storm of reduced funding, restrictions on the operations of conservation agencies, and elevated human threats to nature. We identify the immediate steps necessary to address these challenges and support ongoing conservation efforts. We then highlight systemic flaws in contemporary conservation and identify opportunities to restructure for greater resilience. Finally, we emphasize the critical importance of conserving habitat and regulating unsafe wildlife trade practices to reduce the risk of future pandemics.","Lindsey, Peter; Allan, James; Brehony, Peadar; Dickman, Amy; Robson, Ashley; Begg, Colleen; Bhammar, Hasita; Blanken, Lisa; Breuer, Thomas; Fitzgerald, Kathleen; Flyman, Michael; Gandiwa, Patience; Giva, Nicia; Kaelo, Dickson; Nampindo, Simon; Nyambe, Nyambe; Steiner, Kurt; Parker, Andrew; Roe, Dilys; Thomson, Paul; Trimble, Morgan; Caron, Alexandre; Tyrrell, Peter",Nat Ecol Evol,,250

METHODS: Data were from a large US healthcare registry (Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America Rheumatoid Arthritis Registry). The analysis included patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with a documented diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a valid baseline Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of >2.8 and no prior bDMARD or tsDMARD use. Outcomes were captured at 1-year postinitiation of a TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, golimumab or infliximab) or a non-TNFi (abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab, anakinra or tofacitinib) and included CDAI, 28-Joint Modified Disease Activity Score, patient-reported outcomes (including the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, EuroQol-5 Dimension score, sleep, anxiety, morning stiffness and fatigue) and rates of anaemia. Groups were propensity score-matched at baseline to account for potential confounding. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences observed between the TNFi and non-TNFi treatment groups for outcomes assessed, except the incidence rate ratio for anaemia, which slightly favoured the TNFi group (19.04 per 100 person-years) versus the non-TNFi group (24.01 per 100 person-years, p=0.03). No potential effect modifiers were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of no significant differences in outcomes between first-line TNF versus first-line non-TNF groups support RA guidelines, which recommend individualised care based on clinical judgement and consideration of patient preferences.","Pappas, Dimitrios A; St John, Gregory; Etzel, Carol J; Fiore, Stefano; Blachley, Taylor; Kimura, Toshio; Punekar, Rajeshwari; Emeanuru, Kelechi; Choi, Jeannie; Boklage, Susan; Kremer, Joel M",Ann. rheum. dis,,250

The Marseille-4 variant caused an epidemic that started in August and is still ongoing. METHODS: The 1038 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained in our laboratory by next-generation sequencing with Illumina technology were analysed using Nextclade and nextstrain/ncov pipelines and IQ-TREE. A Marseille-4-specific qPCR assay was implemented. Demographic and clinical features were compared between patients with the Marseille-4 variant and those with earlier strains. RESULTS: Marseille-4 harbours 13 hallmark mutations. One leads to an S477N substitution in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein targeted by current vaccines. Using a specific qPCR, it was observed that Marseille-4 caused 12-100% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Marseille from September 2020, being involved in 2106 diagnoses. This variant was more frequently associated with hypoxemia than were clade 20A strains before May 2020. It caused a re-infection in 11 patients diagnosed with different SARS-CoV-2 strains before June 2020, suggesting either short-term protective immunity or a lack of cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Marseille-4 should be considered as a major SARS-CoV-2 variant. Its sudden appearance points towards an animal reservoir, possibly mink. The protective role of past exposure and current vaccines against this variant should be evaluated.","Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Colson, Philippe; Levasseur, Anthony; Devaux, Christian A; Gautret, Philippe; Bedotto, Marielle; Delerce, Jeremy; Brechard, Ludivine; Pinault, Lucile; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Fenollar, Florence; Raoult, Didier",Int J Infect Dis,,250

395977,Strengths-based actions to enhance wellbeing in the time of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since a national lockdown was introduced across the UK in March, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer screening has been suspended, routine diagnostic work deferred, and only urgent symptomatic cases prioritised for diagnostic intervention. In this study, we estimated the impact of delays in diagnosis on cancer survival outcomes in four major tumour types. METHODS: In this national population-based modelling study, we used linked English National Health Service (NHS) cancer registration and hospital administrative datasets for patients aged 15-84 years, diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and oesophageal cancer between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2010, with follow-up data until Dec 31, 2014, and diagnosed with lung cancer between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2012, with follow-up data until Dec 31, 2015. We use a routes-to-diagnosis framework to estimate the impact of diagnostic delays over a 12-month period from the commencement of physical distancing measures, on March 16, 2020, up to 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. To model the subsequent impact of diagnostic delays on survival, we reallocated patients who were on screening and routine referral pathways to urgent and emergency pathways that are associated with more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. We considered three reallocation scenarios representing the best to worst case scenarios and reflect actual changes in the diagnostic pathway being seen in the NHS, as of March 16, 2020, and estimated the impact on net survival at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis to calculate the additional deaths that can be attributed to cancer, and the total years of life lost (YLLs) compared with pre-pandemic data. FINDINGS: We collected data for 32â583 patients with breast cancer, 24â975 with colorectal cancer, 6744 with oesophageal cancer, and 29â305 with lung cancer. Across the three different scenarios, compared with pre-pandemic figures, we estimate a 7·9-9·6% increase in the number of deaths due to breast cancer up to year 5 after diagnosis, corresponding to between 281 (95% CI 266-295) and 344 (329-358) additional deaths. For colorectal cancer, we estimate 1445 (1392-1591) to 1563 (1534-1592) additional deaths, a 15·3-16·6% increase; for lung cancer, 1235 (1220-1254) to 1372 (1343-1401) additional deaths, a 4·8-5·3% increase; and for oesophageal cancer, 330 (324-335) to 342 (336-348) additional deaths, 5·8-6·0% increase up to 5 years after diagnosis. For these four tumour types, these data correspond with 3291-3621 additional deaths across the scenarios within 5 years. The total additional YLLs across these cancers is estimated to be 59â204-63â229 years. INTERPRETATION: Substantial increases in the number of avoidable cancer deaths in England are to be expected as a result of diagnostic delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Urgent policy interventions are necessary, particularly the need to manage the backlog within routine diagnostic services to mitigate the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with cancer.

In this paper we provide an assessment of the targeted approach to containment. We propose a SIR-macro model that allows for heterogeneous agents in terms of mortality rates and contact rates, and in which the government optimally bans people from working. We find that under a targeted policy, the optimal containment reaches a larger portion of the population than under a blanket policy and is held in place for longer. Compared to a blanket policy, a targeted approach results in a smaller death count. Yet, it is not a panacea: the recession is larger under such approach as the containment policy applies to a larger fraction of people, remains in place for longer, and herd immunity is achieved later. Moreover, we find that increased interactions between low- and high-risk individuals effectively reduce the benefits of a targeted approach to containment. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.","Checo, A.; Grigoli, F.; Mota, J.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper first describes the recent evolution (quarterly 2020 data) of the Spanish non-financial corporate sector (gross value added, labor cost, capital formation, profits) in the assessment of the vulnerability and resilience of the sector to the shock of the COVID pandemic. Then second, it estimates a probit model to evaluate the EU country effects in the explanation of the different propensity firms in the European Company Survey database to adopt innovative management and organization practices. Findings: In the Spring of 2020, the Spanish NFC were still recovering from the great recession (low resilience), and the severe contraction in value-added and profits of the corporate sector in the first three quarters of the year evidences its high vulnerability. The proved complementarity between organizational and information related assets implies that the low endowment of organizational capital of Spanish firms, could be a severe limitation for the advancement toward digitalization. Research limitations/implications: The aggregate corporate sector data used in the analysis of vulnerability and resilience of Spanish firms does not account for the heterogeneous effects of the pandemic across economic sectors (manufacturing and services, for example) and across firms (large versus small ones). Originality/value: The paper complements the country-level analysis of the impact of the COVID pandemic in the Spanish economy with the analysis of the impact of the pandemic in the performance of the corporate sector. It provides one of the first analysis of the current endowment of organization capital of Spanish firms and highlights its relevance for productivity growth. © 2021, Vicente Salas-Fumás.","Salas-Fumás, V.",Applied Economic Analysis,,250

In this paper, we theorize a new notion-the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply-demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed.","Ivanov, Dmitry",Ann Oper Res,,250

This unprecedented public health risk has motivated research towards understanding the disease in general, identifying drugs to treat the disease, developing potential vaccines, etc. This has given rise to a rapidly growing body of literature that doubles in number of publications every 20 days as of May 2020. Providing medical professionals with means to quickly analyze the literature and discover growing areas of knowledge is necessary for addressing their question and information needs.

We do that by applying state-of-the-art named entity recognition, classification, clustering and other NLP techniques. By applying NER tools, we capture relevant bioentities (such as diseases, internal body organs, etc.) and assess the strength of their relationship with COVID-19 by the extent they are discussed in the corpus. We also collect a variety of symptoms and co-morbidities discussed in reference to COVID-19. Our clustering algorithm identifies topics represented by groups of related terms, and computes clusters corresponding to documents associated with the topic terms. Among the topics we observe several that persist through the duration of multiple weeks and have numerous associated documents, as well several that appear as emerging topics with fewer documents.

402480,Covid-19: US reports low rate of new infections in people already vaccinated,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In France, the entire population was put under a total lockdown from March 17 to May 11, 2020 during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Whether the lockdown had consequences on the management of medical emergencies such as stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) has yet to be fully evaluated. This article describes hospitalization rates for acute stroke in 2 French regions that experienced contrasting rates of COVID-19 infection, before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown (January to June 2020). METHODS: All patients admitted for acute stroke/TIA into all public and private hospitals of the 2 study regions were included. Data were retrieved from the National Hospitalization Database (PMSI). In the most affected region (Grand-Est), the hospitalization rates observed in April 2020 were compared with the rates in the same period in the least affected region (Occitanie) and in the 3 prior years (2017-2019). RESULTS: There was a significant decline in hospitalization rates for stroke/TIA within the region most affected by COVID-19 during the month of April 2020 compared with previous years, while no significant change was seen in the least affected region. After lockdown, we observed a fast rebound in the rate of hospitalization for stroke/TIA in the most affected region, contrasting with a slower rebound in the least affected region. In both regions, patients with COVID-19 stroke more frequently had ischemic stroke, a nonsignificant greater prevalence of diabetes, they were less frequently admitted to stroke units, and mortality was higher than in patients without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrates a significant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a fast recovery after the end of the French lockdown in the most affected region, while the least affected region saw a nonsignificant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a slow recovery. These results and recommendations could be used by the health authorities to prepare for future challenges.","Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Giroud, Maurice; Benzenine, Eric; Cottenet, Jonathan; Roussot, Adrien; Aho-Glélé, Ludwig Serge; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Béjot, Yannick; Quantin, Catherine",Stroke,,250

This study explores a specific phenotype of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation (COV-HI), and its associations with escalation of respiratory support and survival. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive inpatients (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to University College London Hospitals and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals in the UK with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of community-acquired infection. Demographic data, laboratory tests, and clinical status were recorded from the day of admission until death or discharge, with a minimum follow-up time of 28 days. We defined COV-HI as a C-reactive protein concentration greater than 150 mg/L or doubling within 24 h from greater than 50 mg/L, or a ferritin concentration greater than 1500 µg/L. Respiratory support was categorised as oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation. Initial and repeated measures of hyperinflammation were evaluated in relation to the next-day risk of death or need for escalation of respiratory support (as a combined endpoint), using a multi-level logistic regression model. Findings: We included 269 patients admitted to one of the study hospitals between March 1 and March 31, 2020, among whom 178 (66%) were eligible for escalation of respiratory support and 91 (34%) patients were not eligible. Of the whole cohort, 90 (33%) patients met the COV-HI criteria at admission. Despite having a younger median age and lower median Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, a higher proportion of patients with COV-HI on admission died during follow-up (36 [40%] of 90 patients) compared with the patients without COV-HI on admission (46 [26%] of 179). Among the 178 patients who were eligible for full respiratory support, 65 (37%) met the definition for COV-HI at admission, and 67 (74%) of the 90 patients whose respiratory care was escalated met the criteria by the day of escalation. Meeting the COV-HI criteria was significantly associated with the risk of next-day escalation of respiratory support or death (hazard ratio 2·24 [95% CI 1·62-2·87]) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity. Interpretation: Associations between elevated inflammatory markers, escalation of respiratory support, and survival in people with COVID-19 indicate the existence of a high-risk inflammatory phenotype. COV-HI might be useful to stratify patient groups in trial design.

METHOD: Cross-sectional study based on a survey administered to medical and nursing staff. In May 2020, Argentine facilities with more than 500 annual births were contacted; 58 % of these were from the public sector. RESULTS: In total, 104/147 facilities answered (71 %). All had guidelines for care during the pandemic, and 93 % indicated they had been trained on how to use them. A companion was not allowed during childbirth in 26 % of private facilities and in 60 % of public ones (p < 0.01). Deferred cord clamping was recommended in 87 %; rooming-in with asymptomatic newborns was promoted in 62 %; breastfeeding using protective measures was recommended in 70 %; and breast milk using a bottle, in 23 %. In 94 %, family visiting in the Neonatology Unit was restricted. Difficulties included the unavailability of individual rooms for symptomatic newborn infants and a potential shortage of health care staff and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: All facilities are aware of the national guidelines to fight the pandemic. Most have the resources to comply with the recommended protective measures. There is uncertainty as to whether personal protective equipment, staff, and physical space available at the different facilities would be enough if cases increased significantly.","Geffner, Sofía C; Ávila, Aldana S; Etcharrán, M Luz; Fernández, Ariel L; Mariani, Gonzalo L; Vain, Néstor E",Arch Argent Pediatr,,250

Knowledge of the increased risk of infection in dental settings has been disseminated to the public and guidelines have been formulated to assist dental attendance decision-making. However, dental attendance behaviors incompatible with treatment need is not uncommon in clinical settings. Important gaps remain in the knowledge about how psychological factors are affecting dental attendance behaviors during the COVID-19 epidemic. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was performed during February and March 2020. A total of 342 and 294 dental patients who attended and avoided dental visits, respectively, were included. The participants were classified into four groups based on dental attendance behavior and emergent/urgent dental treatment need. Bivariate analysis was performed to investigate factors associated with dental attendance. Multivariable logistic regression based on principal component scores was performed to identify major psychological constructs associated with unnecessary dental avoidance and attendance. Among all the factors explored, inability to wear masks during dental treatment (P &lt; 0.001;effect size: 0.32) was most closely associated with the overall pattern of dental attendance among participants. Multivariable regression suggested that unnecessary dental avoidance was associated with perceived risk of infection in general and in dental settings (odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.62 [0.53, 0.72];p &lt; 0.001), perceived impact of COVID-19 and dental problems on general health (0.79 [0.65, 0.97];0.021), and personal traits such as trust and anxiety (0.77 [0.61, 0.98];0.038). Unnecessary dental attendance was associated with optimism toward the epidemic (1.68 [1.42, 2.01];&lt;0.001) and trust (1.39 [1.13, 1.74];0.002). Multidisciplinary efforts involving dental and medical professionals as well as psychologists are warranted to promote more widespread adoption, among the general public, of dental attendance behaviors compatible with dental treatment need during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wen, Y.

Inhibiting interaction of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (SRBD ) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid these limitations, we demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers' binding to the region on SRBD that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. With aptamer selection against SRBD and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2-6 was identified and applied to prevent, compete with, and substitute ACE2 from binding to SRBD . CoV2-6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent aptamer CoV2-6C3 (cb-CoV2-6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. cb-CoV2-6C3 is stable in serum for more than 12â h and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14â days. Furthermore, cb-CoV2-6C3 binds to SRBD with high affinity (Kd =0.13â nM) and blocks authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with an IC50 of 0.42â nM.","Sun, Miao; Liu, Siwen; Wei, Xinyu; Wan, Shuang; Huang, Mengjiao; Song, Ting; Lu, Yao; Weng, Xiaonan; Lin, Zhu; Chen, Honglin; Song, Yanling; Yang, Chaoyong",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,250

407604,Global oil market rebalancing amid COVID-19 risk,2020,"The question of how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted remains surprisingly controversial today, especially with reference to airborne transmission. In fact, despite a large body of scientific evidence, health and regulatory authorities still require direct proof of this mode of transmission. To close this gap, we measured the saliva viral load of SARS-CoV-2 of an infected subject located in a hospital room, as well as the airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the room resulting from the person breathing and speaking. As the next step, we simulated the same scenarios to estimate the concentration of RNA copies in the air through a novel predictive theoretical approach. Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis (i.e. a metrological compatibility analysis) of the differences between the experimental and theoretical results by estimating the uncertainties of these two approaches. Our results showed that for an infected subject's saliva load ranging between 2.4x106 and 5.5x106 RNA copies mL-1, the corresponding airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration was not detectable when the person was breathing, but was 16.1 (with an uncertainty of 32.8) RNA copies m-3 when speaking. The application of the novel predictive estimation approach provided average concentrations of 3.2 (uncertainty range of 0.2-8.3) and 18.5 (uncertainty range of 4.5-43.0) RNA copies m-3 for breathing and speaking scenarios, respectively, thus confirming that for the breathing scenario, the airborne RNA concentration would be undetectable, being below the minimum detection threshold of the experimental apparatus (<2 RNA copies m-3).","Buonanno, G.; Robotto, A.; Brizio, E.; Morawska, L.; Civra, A.; Corino, F.; Lembo, D.; Ficco, G.; Stabile, L.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02706v1.pdf,250

The objective of this study is to build and validate a practical nomogram for estimating the risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: A cohort of 366 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was used to develop a prediction model using data collected from 47 locations in Sichuan province from January 2020 to February 2020. The primary outcome was the development of severe COVID-19 during hospitalization. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to reduce data size and select relevant features. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a prediction model incorporating the selected features. The performance of the nomogram regarding the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness was assessed. Internal validation was assessed by bootstrapping. RESULTS: The median age of the cohort was 43 years. Severe patients were older than mild patients by a median of 6 years. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were more common in severe patients. The individualized prediction nomogram included seven predictors: body temperature at admission, cough, dyspnea, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic kidney disease. The model had good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.862, C-index of 0.863 (95% confidence interval, 0.801-0.925), and good calibration. A high C-index value of 0.839 was reached in the interval validation. Decision curve analysis showed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: We established an early warning model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on admission. This model can be used to help predict severe COVID-19 and identify patients at risk of developing severe disease.","Zhou, Yiwu; He, Yanqi; Yang, Huan; Yu, He; Wang, Ting; Chen, Zhu; Yao, Rong; Liang, Zongan",PLoS One,,250

The common encoder in our architecture can capture useful common features present in the different tasks. The common encoder has another advantage of efficient computations, which speeds up the inference time compared to separate models. The specialized decoders heads can then capture the task-specific features. We employ teacher forcing to address the issue of negative samples that hurt the segmentation and localization performance. Finally,we employ transfer learning to fine tune the classifier on unseen pneumonia-like diseases. The MTL architecture can be trained on joint or dis-joint labeled data sets. The training of the architecture follows a carefully designed protocol, that pre trains different sub-models on specialized datasets, before being integrated in the joint MTL model. Our experimental setup involves variety of data sets, where the baseline performance of the 3 tasks is compared to the MTL architecture performance. Moreover, we evaluate the transfer learning mode to COVID-19 data set,both from individual classifier model, and from MTL architecture classification head.","Farag, Abdullah Tarek; El-Wahab, Ahmed Raafat Abd; Nada, Mahmoud; El-Hakeem, Mohamed Yasser Abd; Mahmoud, Omar Sayed; Rashwan, Reem Khaled; Sallab, Ahmad El",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01973v1.pdf,250

The aim of our study was to investigate in asthmatic children the level of asthma control and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown. METHODS: Among asthmatic children attending our clinic, we identified those who had been prescribed the same therapy in March-April 2019 and March-April 2020. The level of asthma control (GINA-score) and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown (March-April 2020) were compared with those of March-April 2019. We separately analyzed a small group of children with severe asthma treated with Omalizumab during the lockdown. RESULTS: We enrolled 92 asthmatic children (67 males). Compared to 2019, in 2020 a higher proportion of children modified their maintenance therapy (38% vs. 15.2%, p < .001), with a significant increase in both the proportion of children who increased (p = .033) and in that of children who decreased their therapy (p = .026). The level of control resulted as significantly higher in 2020 (March p = .023; April p = .007). Also, the 13 children treated with Omalizumab showed a good level of control in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatic children, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had a significant impact on their asthma control and on their attitude toward maintenance therapy.","Ferraro, Valentina Agnese; Zamunaro, Andrea; Spaggiari, Silvia; Di Riso, Daniela; Zanconato, Stefania; Carraro, Silvia",Immun.

The databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, and medRxiv.org were searched for studies comparing the clinical outcomes of asthmatic patients with those of nonasthmatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Mortality data were summarized using the Mantel-Haenszel OR with 95% CI in a random-effects model. Five retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of data from 744 asthmatic patients and 8,151 nonasthmatic patients indicated that the presence of asthma had no significant effect on mortality (OR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.70-1.30; I2 = 0%; p = 0.79). Results were stable in a sensitivity analysis. A descriptive analysis of other clinical outcomes indicated no difference in the duration of hospitalization and the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer between asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients. To conclude, preliminary data indicates that asthma as a comorbidity may not increase the mortality of COVID-19. Data on the influence of asthma on the risk of hospitalization, the duration of hospitalization, the requirement of ICU admission, and disease severity is still too limited to draw any strong conclusions. Further studies with a larger sample size are required to establish strong evidence.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Chen, Jingjing; Chen, Wei; Liu, Ling; Dong, Mei; Ji, Juan; Hu, Die; Zhang, Nianzhi",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,,250

In this paper, graphene oxide was used as a template to prepare ZIF-67, and GO/ZIF-67 was successfully prepared. GO/ZIF-67 was used for the first time to remove boron from water. SEM, XRD, and other characterization methods were used to confirm the structure. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, adsorption thermodynamics, and adsorption mechanism of boron by GO/ZIF-67 were studied in this paper. The adsorption capacity of GO/ZIF-67 for boron is up to 66.65 mg·g-1 at 25 °C, and adsorption process reaches equilibrium in 400 min. Adsorption kinetics indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and adsorption thermodynamics indicates that the adsorption process is a spontaneous endothermic process controlled by entropy change. The adsorption capacity of boron by GO/ZIF-67 does not decrease significantly after four cycles. The adsorption of boron by GO/ZIF-67 has both chemical and physical adsorption. From Zeta potential and adsorption kinetics, it can be seen that there is physical adsorption during the adsorption process and boron mainly has positive charge on the surface of GO/ZIF-67 and graphene oxide hydroxyl bonding. Based on the adsorption thermodynamics and XPS, it is known that there is chemisorption during the adsorption process, and mainly the combination of boron and cobalt sites.","Hu, Guangzhuang; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Yuantao; Xu, Cheng; Liu, Rong; Han, Zhen",,,250

A scale has been recently designed to assess COVID-19-related phobic reactions named the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S). The present study aimed to evaluate factor structure, reliability, and validity of the Persian version of the C19P-S (Persian-C19P-S) in patients with anxiety disorders and to compare COVID-19-related phobia among these patients. Three hundred patients with anxiety disorders completed the Persian-C19P-S and other scales assessing anxiety traits (e.g., the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), the Health Concerns Questionnaire-54 (HCQ-54), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4)) and COVID-19-related distress (e.g., the COVID Stress Scales (CSS) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19)). The results showed that the Persian-C19P-S replicated the four-factor structure of the original C19P-S. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability coefficients evidenced the reliability of the scale. The validity of the scale (convergent and discriminant validity) was confirmed. Patients who had generalized anxiety and panic disorders showed higher phobic reactions related to COVID-19 than those with social anxiety disorder and specific phobia. This study indicates that the Persian version of the C19P-S is a valid scale to be used in Iranian patients with anxiety disorders to evaluate COVID-19-related phobia.

413201,Navigating the Unchartered Waters in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to a current pandemic of unprecedented scale. Although diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately applicable protocol. METHODS: RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8. RESULTS: A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, although this may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction. CONCLUSIONS: As it uses the standard protocols, reagents, and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for coronavirus disease 2019 would allow expanding current screening capacities, thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.","Yelin, Idan; Aharony, Noga; Tamar, Einat Shaer; Argoetti, Amir; Messer, Esther; Berenbaum, Dina; Shafran, Einat; Kuzli, Areen; Gandali, Nagham; Shkedi, Omer; Hashimshony, Tamar; Mandel-Gutfreund, Yael; Halberthal, Michael; Geffen, Yuval; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Kishony, Roy",Clin Infect Dis,,250

In the present work, a novel thermophilic extradiol dioxygenase from Thermomonospora curvata DSM43183 was cloned, expressed, and characterized by phylogenetic and biochemical analyses. This enzyme exhibited excellent thermo-tolerance, displaying optimal activity at 50 °C, remaining >40% activity at 70 °C. Structural modeling and molecular docking demonstrated that both active center and pocket-construction loops locate at the C-terminal domain. Site-specific mutants D285A, H205V, F301V based on a rational design were obtained to widen the entrance of substrates; resulting in significantly improved catalytic performance for all the 3 mutants. Compared to the wild-type, the mutant D285A showed remarkably improved activities with respect to the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, catechol, and 3-chlorocatechol, by 17.7, 6.9, and 3.7-fold, respectively. The results thus verified the effectiveness of modeling guided design; and confirmed that the C-terminal loop structure indeed plays a decisive role in determining catalytic ring-opening efficiency and substrate specificity of the enzyme. This study provided a novel thermostable dioxygenase with a broad substrate promiscuity for detoxifying environmental pollutants and provided a new thinking for further enzyme engineering of EDOs.","Zhang, Xiaowen; Huang, Zihao; Wang, Dan; Zhang, Yan; Eser, Bekir Engin; Gu, Zhenyu; Dai, Rongrong; Gao, Renjun; Guo, Zheng",J Hazard Mater,,250

The study aims to assess the short-term influence of air pollution and climate on COVID19 incidence in Lombardy (Italy), during the early stage of the outbreak, before the implementation of the lockdown measures. The daily number of COVID19 cases in Lombardy from February 25th to March 10th, 2020, and the daily average concentrations up to 15 days before the study period of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), O3, SO2, and NO2 together with climate variables (temperature, relative humidity - RH%, wind speed, precipitation), were analyzed. A univariable mixed model with a logarithm transformation as link function was applied for each day, from 15 days (lag15) to one day (lag1) before the day of detected cases, to evaluate the effect of each variable. Additionally, change points (Break Points-BP) in the relationship between incident cases and air pollution or climatic factors were estimated. The results did not show a univocal relationship between air quality or climate factors and COVID19 incidence. PM10, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the last lags seem to be related to an increased COVID19 incidence, probably due to an increased susceptibility of the host. In addition, low temperature and low wind speed in some lags resulted associated with increased daily COVID19 incidence. The findings observed suggest that these factors, in particular conditions and lags, may increase individual susceptibility to the development of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.","Stufano, Angela; Lisco, Stefania; Bartolomeo, Nicola; Marsico, Antonella; Lucchese, Guglielmo; Jahantigh, Hamidreza; Soleo, Leonardo; Moretti, Massimo; Trerotoli, Paolo; De Palma, Giuseppe; Lovreglio, Piero",Environ Res,,250

METHODS: We reviewed neurologic symptoms in 71 deaths due to COVID-19 at the first US hospital with reported cases, of which 66 (93%) had medical comorbidities, 47 (66%) came from assisted living facilities or nursing homes and 35 (49%) had baseline dementia. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (86%) demonstrated neurologic symptoms at hospital admission. Altered mental status was seen in 47 patients (66%) and represented the most common neurologic symptom. Seven patients (10%) were comatose at hospital admission and 5 (7%) presented with altered mental status without respiratory symptoms. Three patients had seizures and two had strokes. Hypertension (61%), cardiovascular disease (59%), and dementia (49%) were the most common comorbidities associated with death due to COVID-19 in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic symptoms, particularly altered mental status, are very common in COVID-19 patients with high risk of mortality.

The percentage of viable frozen-thawed sperm (%ViableSperm) determined by flow cytometry varied from -2.2 in LF to + 7.8 in HF bulls, as compared to the average %ViableSperm (54.7%) measured in an 860-sire population. Seminal proteins were analyzed by label free mass spectrometry, with the support of statistical and bioinformatics analyses. This approach identified 1,445 proteins, associated with protein folding, cell-cell adhesion, NADH dehydrogenase activity, ATP-binding, proteasome complex, among other processes. There were 338 seminal proteins differentially expressed (p < 0.05) in LF and HF bulls. Based on multivariate analysis, BSP5 and seminal ribonuclease defined the HF phenotype, while spermadhesin-1, gelsolin, tubulins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, calmodulin, ATP synthase, sperm equatorial segment protein 1, peroxiredoxin-5, secretoglobin family 1D and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase characterized the LF phenotype. Regression models indicated that %ViableSperm of bulls was related to seminal plasma peroxiredoxin-5, spermadhesin-1 and the spermadhesin-1 × BSP5 interaction (R2 = 0.84 and 0.79; p < 0.05). This report is the largest dataset of bovine seminal plasma proteins.

414411,"Re-thinking Information Ethics: Truth, Conspiracy Theories, and Librarians in the COVID-19 Era",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with autoimmune diseases were advised to shield to avoid COVID-19, but information on their prognosis is lacking. We characterised 30-day outcomes and mortality after hospitalisation with COVID-19 among patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, and compared outcomes after hospital admissions among similar patients with seasonal influenza. METHODS: A multinational network cohort study was conducted using electronic health records data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (United States [US]), Optum [US], Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (US), Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalisation Linked Data (SIDIAP-H) (Spain), and claims data from IQVIA Open Claims (US) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) (South Korea). All patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, diagnosed and/or hospitalised between January and June 2020 with COVID-19, and similar patients hospitalised with influenza in 2017-2018 were included. Outcomes were death and complications within 30 days of hospitalisation. RESULTS: We studied 133 589 patients diagnosed and 48 418 hospitalised with COVID-19 with prevalent autoimmune diseases. Most patients were female, aged &#8805;50 years with previous comorbidities. The prevalence of hypertension (45.5-93.2%), chronic kidney disease (14.0-52.7%) and heart disease (29.0-83.8%) was higher in hospitalised vs diagnosed patients with COVID-19. Compared with 70 660 hospitalised with influenza, those admitted with COVID-19 had more respiratory complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and higher 30-day mortality (2.2% to 4.3% vs 6.3% to 24.6%).

Particularly in health and medical research, Google Trends has been increasingly used over the last decade. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the search activity of pain-related parameters on Google Trends from among the most populated regions worldwide over a 3-year period from before the report of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in these regions (January 2018) until December 2020. METHODS: Search terms from the following regions were used for the analysis: India, China, Europe, the United States, Brazil, Pakistan, and Indonesia. In total, 24 expressions of pain location were assessed. Search terms were extracted using the local language of the respective country. Python scripts were used for data mining. All statistical calculations were performed through exploratory data analysis and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Although the overall search activity for pain-related terms increased, apart from pain entities such as headache, chest pain, and sore throat, we observed discordant search activity. Among the most populous regions, pain-related search parameters for shoulder, abdominal, and chest pain, headache, and toothache differed significantly before and after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 cases (for all, P<.001). In addition, we observed a heterogenous, marked increase or reduction in pain-related search parameters among the most populated regions. CONCLUSIONS: As internet searches are a surrogate for public interest, we assume that our data are indicative of an increased incidence of pain after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as these increased incidences vary across geographical and anatomical locations, our findings could potentially facilitate the development of specific strategies to support the most affected groups.","Szilagyi, Istvan-Szilard; Ullrich, Torsten; Lang-Illievich, Kordula; Klivinyi, Christoph; Schittek, Gregor Alexander; Simonis, Holger; Bornemann-Cimenti, Helmar",J Med Internet Res,,250

Here, we report the generation and the preclinical evaluation of a novel replication-defective gorilla adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAd-COV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, T helper (Th)1-dominated cellular response. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at a massive scale, different GRAd genome deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank bioreactors. This preliminary dataset identified GRAd-COV2 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate, supporting the translation of the GRAd-COV2 vaccine in a currently ongoing phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04528641).","Capone, Stefania; Raggioli, Angelo; Gentile, Michela; Battella, Simone; Lahm, Armin; Sommella, Andrea; Contino, Alessandra Maria; Urbanowicz, Richard A; Scala, Romina; Barra, Federica; Leuzzi, Adriano; Lilli, Eleonora; Miselli, Giuseppina; Noto, Alessia; Ferraiuolo, Maria; Talotta, Francesco; Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Castilletti, Concetta; Matusali, Giulia; Colavita, Francesca; Lapa, Daniele; Meschi, Silvia; Capobianchi, Maria; Soriani, Marco; Folgori, Antonella; Ball, Jonathan K; Colloca, Stefano; Vitelli, Alessandra",Mol. ther,,250

416973,All roads lead to coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which may be driven, in part, by nosocomial exposure. If HCW exposure is predominantly nosocomial, HCWs in paediatric facilities, where few patients are admitted with COVID-19, may lack antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and be at increased risk during the current resurgence. AIM: To compare the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 amongst HCWs in paediatric facilities in seven European countries and South Africa (N=8). METHODS: All categories of paediatric HCWs were invited to participate in the study, irrespective of previous symptoms. A single blood sample was taken and data about previous symptoms were documented. Serum was shipped to a central laboratory in London where SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G was measured. FINDINGS: In total, 4114 HCWs were recruited between 1st May and mid-July 2020. The range of seroprevalence was 0-16.93%. The highest seroprevalence was found in London (16.93%), followed by Cape Town, South Africa (10.36%). There were no positive HCWs in the Austrian, Estonian and Latvian cohorts; 2/300 [0.66%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-2.4] HCWs tested positive in Lithuania; 1/124 (0.81%, 95% CI 0.14-4.3) HCWs tested positive in Romania; and 1/76 (1.3%, 95% CI 0.23-7.0) HCWs tested positive in Greece. CONCLUSION: Overall seroprevalence amongst paediatric HCWs is similar to their national populations and linked to the national COVID-19 burden. Staff working in paediatric facilities in low-burden countries have very low seroprevalence rates and thus are likely to be susceptible to COVID-19. Their susceptibility to infection may affect their ability to provide care in the face of increasing cases of COVID-19, and this highlights the need for appropriate preventative strategies in paediatric healthcare settings.","Goldblatt, D; Johnson, M; Falup-Pecurariu, O; Ivaskeviciene, I; Spoulou, V; Tamm, E; Wagner, M; Zar, H J; Bleotu, L; Ivaskevicius, R; Papadatou, I; Jõgi, P; Lischka, J; Franckling-Smith, Z; Isarova, D; Grandjean, L; Zavadska, D",J Hosp Infect,,250

Drawing on social information processing (SIP) and job-demand resource (JD-R) theory, job stress was proposed as a mediator explaining this relationship. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected via a structured questionnaire through Google Docs from 258 respondents working at different capacity in Indian organizations. The study includes those respondents who are working from home during COVID-19 pandemic situation. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings Psychological contract breach was negatively impacting innovative behavior and well-being. Job stress mediated the relationship between psychological contract breach and innovative behavior as well as well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic situation and especially for those who are working from home only. Research limitations/implications The data for the study were collected from the employees working from home during this COVID-19 pandemic situation was cross-sectional. The study implied or spoke about the unmet expectations leading to reduced innovative behavior harming the organization's effectiveness and it also reduces well-being which harms the individual in the era of social and financial uncertainty. Originality/value The novel contribution of the study is integrating SIP and JD-R theory during the pandemic situation. The results highlighted meticulous empirical evidence which answers the question that how the unmet expectations cause a detrimental effect on the employees as well as the organizations in this COVID-19 pandemic situation.","Karani, A.; Deshpande, R.; Mall, S.; Jayswal, M.",International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy,,250

It is a respiratory disease, and acute kidney injury (AKI) is rare; however, if a patient develops severe AKI, renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be considered. Recently, we had a critically ill COVID-19 patient who developed severe AKI and needed continuous RRT (CRRT). To avoid the potential risk of infection from CRRT effluents, we measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic material in the effluents by qRT-PCR, and low copy numbers of the viral genome were detected. Due to unstable hemodynamic status in critically ill patients, CRRT should be the first choice for severe AKI in COVID-19 patients. We suggest prevention of clinical infection and control during administration of RRT in the acute phase of COVID-19 patients with AKI or multiple organ failure.","Katagiri, Daisuke; Ishikane, Masahiro; Ogawa, Tatsunori; Kinoshita, Noriko; Katano, Harutaka; Suzuki, Tadaki; Fukaya, Takashi; Hinoshita, Fumihiko; Ohmagari, Norio",Blood Purif,,250

CONCLUSION: The rapid HTA evaluation showed that Reduning injection has good safety, effectiveness and economy. The mechanisms of Reduning in antipyretic and anti-inflammatory, immune regulation and anti-virus suggest the rationality of Reduning in treating COVID-19, but drug monitoring should be done well in the use process.","Guo, Si-Rui; Zhao, Zi-Nan; Jin, Peng-Fei; Zhang, Bi-Hua; Wu, Xue-Jun; Zhang, Shan-Shan; Hu, Xin",Chin.

Here, among other things, planning, training, exercises and stockpiling are crucial elements of being prepared to deal with a pandemic.","Walus, Andreas; Holbe, Fabian",Gesundheitswesen,,250

Case report: We reported a case of a 68-year-old asymptomatic male referred with a cataract in his right eye (OD). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 70 letters (20/ 40) in the OD and 85 letters (20/ 20) in the left eye (OS). Ophthalmological examination revealed a significant nuclear cataract in the OD that explained the visual acuity. Fundus imaging showed a faint nasal margin elevation of the optic disc of both eyes (OU). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a sectorial retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) atrophy in the inferior quadrant in the OS. Nevertheless, visual field (VF) did not demonstrate defects. Neuroimaging was normal and examination of CSF revealed an opening pressure of 500 mmH2O. A diagnosis of IIH was confirmed and acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily was recommended. After 12 months of follow-up, RNFL thickness remained stable and VF did not confirm defects. Conclusion: A routine eye examination was the onset of IIH in our case. Thus, the ophthalmologist played a crucial role in the early diagnosis of this syndrome. Papilledema is usually a key criterion for IIH, so after its detection, exclusion diagnosis and treatment should be initiated in order to avoid permanent visual loss.","Sargues, Lidia Remolí; Sanchis, María Isabel Soler; Adsuara, Clara Monferrer; Villanueva, Carolina García; Salvador, Belén López; Taulet, Enrique Cervera",Rom J Ophthalmol,,250

Self-selected urologists worldwide completed an online survey by the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). A total of 2494 urologists from 76 countries responded, including 1161 (46.6%) urologists in an academic setting, 719 (28.8%) in a private practice, and 614 (24.6%) in the public sector. The largest proportion (1074 (43.1%)) were from Europe, with the remainder from East/Southeast Asia (441 (17.7%)), West/Southwest Asia (386 (15.5%)), Africa (209 (8.4%)), South America (198 (7.9%)), and North America (186 (7.5%)). An analysis of differences in responses was carried out by region and practice setting. The results reveal significant restrictions in outpatient consultation and non-emergency surgery, with nonspecific efforts towards additional precautions for preventing the spread of COVID-19 during emergency surgery. These restrictions were less notable in East/Southeast Asia. Urologists often bear the decision-making responsibility regarding access to elective surgery (40.3%). Restriction of both outpatient clinics and non-emergency surgery is considerable worldwide but is lower in East/Southeast Asia. Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 during emergency surgery are common but not specific. The pandemic has had a profound impact on urology practice. There is an urgent need to provide improved guidance for this and future pandemics.","Gravas, Stavros; Bolton, Damien; Gomez, Reynaldo; Klotz, Laurence; Kulkarni, Sanjay; Tanguay, Simon; de la Rosette, Jean",,,250

In protein-nucleic acid interfaces, hotspot residues contribute the majority of binding affinity toward molecular recognition. Hotspot residues are commonly regarded as potential binding sites for compound molecules in drug design projects. The dynamic property is a considerable factor that affects the binding of ligands. Computational approaches have been developed to expedite the prediction of hotspot residues on protein-nucleic acid interfaces. However, existing approaches overlook hotspot dynamics, despite their essential role in protein function. Here, we report a web server named Hotspots In silico Scanning on Nucleic Acid and Protein Interface (HISNAPI) to analyze hotspot residue dynamics by integrating molecular dynamics simulation and one-step free energy perturbation. HISNAPI is capable of not only predicting the hotspot residues in protein-nucleic acid interfaces but also providing insights into their intensity and correlation of dynamic motion. Protein dynamics have been recognized as a vital factor that has an effect on the interaction specificity and affinity of the binding partners. We applied HISNAPI to the case of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a vital target of the antiviral drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. We identified the hotspot residues and characterized their dynamic behaviors, which might provide insight into the target site for antiviral drug design.

425304,The Value of Adapting Clinical Reasoning Teaching Methods,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined three independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cigs led to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome-related genes. Specifically, chemokines including CCL20 and CXCL8 are upregulated in smokers, and CCL5 and CCR1 are upregulated in flavor/nicotine-containing e-cig users. We also found genes implicated in inflammasomes, such as CXCL1, CXCL2, NOD2, and ASC, to be upregulated in smokers and these e-cig users. Vaping flavor and nicotine-less e-cigs, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to COVID-19.","Lee, Abby C; Chakladar, Jaideep; Li, Wei Tse; Chen, Chengyu; Chang, Eric Y; Wang-Rodriguez, Jessica; Ongkeko, Weg M",,,250

SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CoV infections in target cells may stimulate the formation of numerous double-membrane autophagosomes and induce autophagy. Several studies provided evidence that hCoV infections are closely related to various cellular aspects associated with autophagy. Autophagy may even promote hCoV infection and replication. However, so far it is unclear how hCoV infections induce autophagy and whether the autophagic machinery is necessary for viral propagation. Here, we summarize the most recent advances concerning the mutual interplay between the autophagic machinery and the three emerging hCoVs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 and the model system mouse hepatitis virus. We also discuss the applicability of approved and well-tolerated drugs targeting autophagy as a potential treatment against COVID-19.","Zhao, Zhenyu; Lu, Kefeng; Mao, Binli; Liu, Shi; Trilling, Mirko; Huang, Ailong; Lu, Mengji; Lin, Yong",Emerg Microbes Infect,,250

METHODS: A total of 36 confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into the general (n = 17) and critical group (n = 19). The suspected group enrolled 23 suspected COVID-19 patients with the negative nucleic acid test result. We collected all patients' clinical characteristics and some laboratory indicators at the time of admission and conducted Logistic regression analysis after comparing the differences between groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, gender, disease duration, fever history, and comorbidities between the suspected and general group (P > 0.05); however, fibrinogen was statistically different (P < 0.05). Compared with the general group, the oxygenation index and lymphocytes were significantly reduced and the Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and total bilirubin were increased in the critical group (P < 0.05). The fibrinogen OR value was 2.52 (95% CI 1.18-5.36, P = 0.017) and the NLR OR value was 2.91 (95% CI 1.36-6.21, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Fibrinogen is a valuable diagnostic predictor for patients with suspected COVID-19. For confirmed COVID-19 patients, the NLR is a valuable early warning indicator.","Song, Lu; Dong, Yongkang; Xu, Ming; Shi, Dongwu; Guo, Wei; Li, Yaojun; Zhang, Xinri; Ma, Xia",Expert Rev Respir Med,,250

This article aims to determine the prognostic biomarker of ceRNA for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. Methods: The expression and clinical significance of LINC00973 in NSCLC tissues were analyzed via the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), lnCAR, and clinical samples in Taihe Hospital. The biological functions and signaling pathways involved in target genes of ceRNA network were analyzed via Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used for prognostic-related mRNA. Results: Expression of LINC00973 was increased in NSCLC tissues. High expression of LINC00973 was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. There were 15 miRNA and 238 differential mRNA in the INC00973-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network, involving cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, tumor growth factor (TGF)-ß, cellular senescence, phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxy kinase (PI3K)-Akt, Hippo, Rap1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cell cycle signaling pathway, etc. The expression levels of RTKN2, NFIX, PTX3, BMP2 and LOXL2 were independent risk factors for the poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Conclusions: LINC00973-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network might be the basis for determining pivotal post-translational regulatory mechanisms in the progression of NSCLC. BMP2, LOXL2, NFIX, PTX3 and RTKN2 might be valuable prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets.","Guo, Qiang; Li, Dan; Luo, Xiangyu; Yuan, Ye; Li, Tian; Liu, Huasong; Wang, Xinju",Front Immunol,,250

However, inspite of initial efforts at understanding the contributions of SARS-CoV-2 variants, most were unable to delineate causality. Hence, in this study we re-visited the contributions of different clades of viruses (G, GR and GH) along with other attributes in explaining the disparity in mortality rates among countries. A total of 26,642 high quality SARS-CoV-2 sequences were included and the A23,403G (S:D614G) variant was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with C14,408 U (RdRp: P323L). Linear regression analyses revealed increase in age [Odds ratio: 1.055 (p-value 0.000358)] and higher frequency of clade-G viruses [Odds ratio: 1.029(p-value 0.000135)] could explain 37.43% of the differences in mortality rates across the 58 countries (Multiple R-squared: 0.3743). Next, Machine-Learning algorithms LogitBoost and AdaboostM1 were applied to determine whether countries belonging to high/low mortality groups could be classified using the same attributes and accurate classification was achieved in 70.69% and 62.07% of the countries, respectively. Further, evolutionary analyses of the Indian viral population (n = 662) were carried out. Allele frequency spectrum, nucleotide diversity (&#960;) values and negative Tajima's D values across ORFs were indicative of population expansion. Network analysis revealed the presence of two major clusters of viral haplotypes, namely, clade-G and a variant of clade L [Lv] having the RdRp:A97V amino acid change. Clade-G genomes were found to be evolving more rapidly and were also found in higher proportions in three states with highest mortality rates namely, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. Thus, the findings of this study and results from in vitro studies highlighting the role of these variants in increasing transmissibility and altering response to antivirals reflect the role of viral factors in disease prognosis.","Pandit, Bhaswati; Bhattacharjee, Samsiddhi; Bhattacharjee, Bornali",Infect Genet Evol,,250

Method: A total of 179 children, 5-14 years of age, including a healthy control group (CG, n = 49), and 107 patients with ADHD participated in the study. The ADHD group was further subdivided into predominantly attention deficit (PAD) and predominantly hyperactive impulsive (PHI) subgroups. Blood samples were drawn at 20:00 and 09:00 hours, and urine was collected between blood draws, at baseline and after 4.63 ± 2.3 months of methylphenidate treatment in the ADHD group. Levels and daily fluctuations of ITM were measured by tandem mass spectrometer, and S100B (as a glial inflammatory marker) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Factorial analysis of variance (Stata 12.0) was performed with groups/subgroups, time (baseline/after treatment), hour of day (morning/evening), and presence of depressive symptoms (DS; no/yes) as factors. Results: Tryptamine and indoleacetic acid (IAA) showed no differences between the CG and ADHD groups. Tryptamine exhibited higher evening values (p < 0.0001) in both groups. No changes were associated with methylphenidate or DS. At baseline, in comparison with the rest of study sample, PHI with DS+ group showed among them much greater morning than evening IAA (p < 0.0001), with treatment causing a 50% decrease (p = 0.002). Concerning indolepropionic acid (IPA) MPH was associated with a morning IPA decrease and restored the daily profile observed in the CG. S100B protein showed greater morning than evening concentrations (p = 0.001) in both groups. Conclusion: Variations in ITM may reflect changes associated with the presence of DS, including improvement, among ADHD patients.","Fernández-López, Luisa; Molina-Carballo, Antonio; Cubero-Millán, Isabel; Checa-Ros, Ana; Machado-Casas, Irene; Blanca-Jover, Enrique; Jerez-Calero, Antonio; Madrid-Fernández, Yolanda; Uberos, José; Muñoz-Hoyos, Antonio",J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol,,250

The Howard Brown Health organization has rapidly expanded to include COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and linkage to resources since the first cases were identified in Chicago, Illinois. COVID-19 is penetrating the most vulnerable networks in the United States; existing inequities are widening as community resources and organizations have had to place services on hold.Here we address several questions that arise as organizations build capacity for contact tracing, including questions involving the potential impact of contact tracing, stakeholders who could be involved, the timing of contact tracing deployment, and the impact potential for digital technology.Contact tracing is critical at later stages of epidemic decline given the potential for isolated outbreaks as larger events, schools, stadiums, and festivals reopen. Local contact tracing efforts can have other indirect benefits with respect to limiting transmission, such as increasing testing rates and addressing structural barriers through provision of life-saving resources and access to crucial social support.","Schneider, John; Love, Willie; Rusie, Laura; Flores, Ariana; Tadesse, Beth; Hazra, Anu; Munar, David",Am J Public Health,,250
429028,Coronavirus Disease in South Korea: Antibody Testing from the Perspective of Effective Quarantine Measures,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There is growing concern about the effect of lockdown and social distancing on mental health. Subjective feelings related to social relationships such as detachment have shown a strong effect on mental health, whereas objective factors might have a moderating role in that association. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether social support and living situation have a moderating effect on the association between detachment and affective disorder symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: 3,305 Spanish adults were interviewed by phone at the end of the COVID-19 lockdown (May-June 2020). Detachment during confinement was assessed with a single-item frequency question. Anxiety symptoms were measured through GAD-7, depressive symptoms through PHQ-9, and social support through the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS). Associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms were tested through Tobit regression models. Interactions of detachment with living situation and social support were tested as independent variables. RESULTS: People living alone showed significantly lower levels of anxiety whereas people living with another (but not as a couple) showed higher levels of depression. Detachment was strongly associated with both affective disorders. Social support had a statistically significant moderating effect on that association. Those with a low level of social support and a high level of detachment reported means of depression and anxiety above major depression (10.5 CI 95% 9.6, 11.4 at OSSS=10) and generalized anxiety disorders (10.1 CI 95% 9.2, 11.0 at OSSS=9) cut offs CONCLUSION: Interventions centered on improving social support could alleviate feelings of detachment and prevent affective disorders during lockdowns.","Domènech-Abella, Joan; Gabarrell-Pascuet, Aina; Faris, Lydia Hanaa; Cristóbal-Narváez, Paula; Félez-Nobrega, Mireia; Mortier, Philippe; Vilagut, Gemma; Olaya, Beatriz; Alonso, Jordi; Haro, Josep Maria",J Affect Disord,,250

Despite concerted efforts to curb the spread of the disease, the pandemic continues to strain healthcare systems globally and a safe, highly effective, and globally acceptable and equitable vaccination program, together with pre-existing precautionary measures, is essential to effectively contain the outbreak. We commented on the need to level any uneven power dynamics in COVID-19 vaccine access and distribution. The COVID-19 vaccine distribution must not allow for sovereignty which is tightly linked to historical imbalances in power and resources to result into discrimination between rich and poor countries. Poor countries must be supported in ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccine by levelling the power dynamics that perpetuate inequality and fuel inequity. We must ensure equity, fairness and transparency in COVID-19 distribution and gain public trust in COVID-19 vaccine through participatory community engagement.

Overall, people with diabetes have a higher risk of developing different infectious diseases and demonstrate increased mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a significant risk factor for COVID-19 progression and its severity, poor prognosis, and increased mortality. How diabetes contributes to COVID-19 severity is unclear;however, it may be correlated with the effects of hyperglycemia on systemic inflammatory responses and immune system dysfunction. Using the envelope spike glycoprotein SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, a key protein expressed in metabolic organs and tissues such as pancreatic islets. Therefore, it has been suggested that diabetic patients are more susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, as glucose metabolism impairments complicate the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease in these patients. In this review, we provide insight into the COVID-19 disease complications relevant to diabetes and try to focus on the present data and growing concepts surrounding SARS-CoV-2 infections in T2DM patients.","Norouzi, Mahnaz Norouzi Shaghayegh Ruggiero Alistaire Khan Mohammad S.; Myers, Stephen Kavanagh Kylie Vemuri Ravichandra",Microorganisms,,250
430733,Opportunities amid COVID-19: Advancing intra-African food integration*,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Metabolic myopathies comprise a clinically etiological diverse group of disorders caused by defects in cellular energy metabolism including the breakdown of carbohydrates and fatty acids, which include glycogen storage diseases and fatty acid oxidation disorders. Their wide clinical spectrum ranges from infantile severe multisystemic disorders to adult-onset myopathies. To suspect in adults these disorders, clinical features such as exercise intolerance and recurrent myoglobinuria need investigation while another group presents fixed weakness and cardiomyopathy as a clinical pattern. AREAS COVERED: In metabolic myopathies, clinical manifestations are important to guide diagnostic tests used in order to lead to the correct diagnosis. The authors searched in literature the most recent techniques developed. The authors present an overview of the most common phenotypes of Pompe disease and what is currently known about the mechanism of ERT treatment. The most common disorders of lipid metabolism are overviewed, with their possible dietary or supplementary treatments. EXPERT COMMENTARY: The clinical suspicion is the clue to conduct in-depth investigations in suspected cases of metabolic myopathies that lead to the final diagnosis with biochemical molecular studies and often nowadays by the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to determine gene mutations.","Angelini, Corrado; Marozzo, Roberta; Pegoraro, Valentina; Sacconi, Sabrina",Expert Rev Neurother,,250

430864,From the Quarantine to the General Strike: On Bataille’s Political Economy1,2020,"Norms-shifting interventions (NSI) seek to improve people's well-being by facilitating the transformation of harmful social norms, the shared rules of acceptable actions in a group that prop up harmful health behaviours. Community-based NSI aim for incremental normative change and complement other social and behaviour change strategies, addressing gender, other inequalities, and the power structures that hold inequalities in place. Consequently, they demand that designers and implementers-many who are outsiders-grapple with power, history, and community agency operating in complicated social contexts. Ethical questions include whose voices and values, at which levels, should inform intervention design; who should be accountable for managing resistance that arises during implementation? As interest and funding for NSI increases in lower and middle-income countries, their potential to yield sustained change is balanced by unintentionally reinforcing inequities that violate human rights and social justice pillars guiding health promotion efforts. A review of 125 articles on ethical considerations in public health, social justice, and human rights-where NSI actions intersect-indicated little guidance on practice. To begin to address this gap, we propose ten ethical values and practical ways to engage ethically with the social complexities of NSI and the social change they seek, and a way forward.","Igras, Susan; Kohli, Anjalee; Bukuluki, Paul; Cislaghi, Beniamino; Khan, Sonali; Tier, Catherine",Glob Public Health,,250

While most suffer from mild symptoms, some patients progress to a severe disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and an associated systemic hyper-inflammation. First to characterize key cytokines and their dynamics in this hyper-inflammatory condition, we assessed abundance and correlative expression of a panel of forty eight cytokines in patients progressing to ARDS, as compared to patients with mild disease. Then in an ongoing randomized control trial of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), we analyzed rapid effects of CPT on the systemic cytokine dynamics, as a correlate for the level of hypoxia experienced by the patients. We identified an anti-inflammatory role of CPT independent of its neutralizing antibody content. Neutralizing antibodies as well as reductions in circulating interleukin-6 and interferon gamma induced protein 10, contributed to marked rapid reductions in hypoxia in response to CPT.","Bandopadhyay, Purbita; Rozario, Ranit D039; Lahiri, Abhishake; Sarif, Jafar; Ray, Yogiraj; Paul, Shekhar Ranjan; Roy, Rammohan; Maiti, Rajshekhar; Chaudhuri, Kausik; Bagchi, Saugata; Maiti, Ayan; Perwez, Md Masoom; Sharma Sarkar, Biswanath; Roy, Devlina; Chakraborty, Rahul; Vasudevan, Janani Srinivasa; Sharma, Sachin; Biswas, Durba; Maiti, Chikam; Saha, Bibhuti; Bhattacharya, Prasun; Pandey, Rajesh; Chatterjee, Shilpak; Paul, Sandip; Ganguly, Dipyaman",J. infect. dis,,250
431066,"The BMJ interview: Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, on covid-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: There are two distinctive acral manifestations of COVID-19 embodying disparate clinical phenotypes: one is perniosis occurring in mildly symptomatic patients, typically children; the second is the thrombotic retiform purpura of critically ill COVID19 adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compare light-microscopic, phenotypic, cytokine, and SARS-CoV-2 protein and RNA profiles in COVID-19-associated perniosis of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with the thrombotic retiform purpura of critical patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: The COVID-19-associated perniosis exhibited vasocentric and eccrinotropic T-cell and monocyte-derived CD11c, CD14, and CD123+ dendritic cell infiltrates. Both COVID associated and idiopathic perniosis showed striking expression of the type I interferon-inducible myxovirus resistance protein-A (MXA), an established marker for type I interferon signaling in tissue. SARS-CoV-2 RNA, IL- 6 and caspase 3 were minimally expressed and confined to mononuclear inflammatory cells. The biopsies from livedo/retiform purpura showed pauci-inflammatory vascular thrombosis without any MXA decoration. Blood vessels exhibited extensive complement deposition with endothelial cell localization of SARS-CoV-2 protein, IL6, and caspase 3; SARS CoV-2 RNA was not seen. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19-associated perniosis represents an exaggerated immune reaction to a virus with significant type-I interferon signaling important to SARS-CoV-2 eradication and has implications in regards to a more generalized highly-inflammatory response. We hypothesize that in the thrombotic retiform purpura of critically ill patients with COVID-19, the vascular thrombosis in the skin and other organ systems is associated with a minimal interferon response allowing excessive viral replication with release of viral proteins that localize to extrapulmonary endothelium and trigger extensive complement activation.","Magro, C; Mulvey, J J; Laurence, J; Sanders, S; Crowson, N; Grossman, M; Harp, J; Nuovo, G",Br. j. dermatol,,250

The purpose of the study is to evaluate mortality and morbidity in orthopedic trauma patients surgically treated with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, comparing them to a control group of COVID-19 negative. We retrospectively identified patients admitted to our Emergency Room from March 8th to May 4th 2020 (time frame corresponding to the first wave of the pandemic peak, one of the most severe in the world at that time) with a diagnosis of fracture that were subsequently surgically treated. We applied a dedicated pathway for the management of COVID-19 trauma patients allowed to perform an early surgery and short hospitalization. For each patient included demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiological data and type of treatment for COVID-19 infection were collected. Sixty-five (65) patients were identified. Of those, 17 (6 women and 11 men, mean age 63.41 years old, mean ASA grade 2.35) were COVID-19 positive (study group), while the others were control group (mean age 56.58 years old, mean ASA grade 2.21). In the study group, the preoperative laboratory tests showed leukocytosis in six and lymphopenia in 15 cases. Fourteen patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. Fifteen patients had an abnormal level of D-dimer. The mortality recorded was 5.8% and 4.1% in the study and control group respectively. Perioperative adverse events were registered in 5 cases (29.4%) in the study group and in 8 (16.6%) in the control group (p>0.05). Dedicated COVID-19 trauma pathway with the aim of an early surgery could be key for a better result in terms of mortality and morbidity. Age and ASA grade could represent independent risk factors for perioperative complications.","Giorgi, Pietro Domenico; Gallazzi, Enrico; Capitani, Paolo; Biancardi, Elena; Bove, Federico; Mezzadri, Umberto; Capitani, Dario; Schirò, Giuseppe Rosario",Pan Afr Med J,,250
431249,'Uncertainty is the only certainty': how pragmatic sociology provides a useful theoretical framework for researching the third sector during COVID-19,2021,"Background: In this paper, we are studying the response of the Serbian government and health authorities to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the early stage of the local outbreak between Mar. 15 thand Apr. 15 th, 2020 by predictive numerical models. Such a study should be helpful to access the effectiveness of measures conducted to suppress the pandemic at a local scale. Methods: We have performed extrapolation of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the first stable set of data exploiting exponential growth (linear in logarithmic scale). Based on obtained coefficients it is performed prediction of a number of cases until the end of March. After initial exponential growth, we have changed predictive model to the generalized gamma function. Obtained results are compared with the number of infections and the prediction for the remainder of the outbreak is given. Findings: We have found that the daily growth rate was above 21.5% at the beginning of the period, increased slightly after the introduction of the State of Emergency and the first set of strict epidemical control measures. It took about 13 days after the first set of strict measures to smooth daily growth. It seems that early government measures had an only moderate impact to reduce growth due to the social behavior of citizens and influx of diaspora returning to Serbia from highly affected areas, i.e., the exponential growth of infected persons is kept but with a reduced slope of about 14–15%. Anyway, it is demonstrated that period required that any measure has effect is up to 15 days after introduction, firstly to exponential growth with a smaller rate and after to smooth function representing the number of infected persons below exponential growth rate. Conclusions: Obtained results are consistent with findings from other countries, i.e., initial exponential growth slows down within the presumed incubation period of 2 weeks after adopting lockdown and other non-pharmaceutical epidemiological measures. However, it is also shown that the exponential growth can continue after this period with a smaller slope. Therefore, quarantine and other social distancing measures should be adopted as soon as possible in a case of any similar outbreak since alternatives mean prolonged epidemical situation and growing costs in human life, pressure on the health system, economy, etc. For modeling the remainder of the outbreak generalized gamma function is used showing accurate results but requiring more samples and pre-processing (data filtering) concerning exponential part of the outbreak. We have estimated the number of infected persons for the remaining part of the outbreak until the end of June.","Djurović, Igor",Heliyon,,250

Morbidity and mortality rates make Madrid one of the worst affected places so far in the wake of the coronavirus. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of post-traumatic growth during the coronavirus crisis and to understand the contribution of meaning, religiosity, and spirituality to such growth; 1,492 people completed the questionnaire; N = 1,091 residents in Madrid were selected for the study. We assessed the personal experience of COVID-19, the Spirituality, Religiosity, Meaning trough Purpose in Life-10 test, and Posttraumatic Growth (Community Post-Traumatic Growth Scale). Results showed significant differences for all measures of growth, with higher values in women. Sex and direct impact of COVID-19 accounted for 4.4% of the variance of growth. The different dimensions of meaning contribute differently to growth. Only religiosity was associated with total growth when meaning was included in the model. This same pattern of results is obtained in models predicting interpersonal and social growth. However, in predicting personal growth, it is spirituality that predicts this type of growth once meaning has been previously controlled for, while religiosity fails to reach a statistically significant level. Our results reflect the interest in maintaining the distinction between spirituality and religiosity, their different roles in traumatic growth and the different dimensions on which each has an effect. Finally, it confirms the importance of meaning in post-traumatic growth, especially the dimension of life goals and purposes.","Prieto-Ursúa, María; Jódar, Rafael",Front Psychol,,250

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our Department is the only urologic service in the Trento Province, near Lombardy, the epicenter of Covid-19 in our Country. We reviewed the surgical and ward activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9 to April 5, 2020). The following outcomes were investigated: surgical load, rate of admissions and bed occupation, and the rate and characteristics of unrecognized Covid-positive patients. Data were compared with that of the same period of 2019 (March 11 to April 7). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: About 63%, 70%, 64%, and 71%, decline in surgery, endoscopy, bed occupation, and admission, respectively, occurred during the 4 weeks after the lockdown, as compared to 2019. Urgent procedures also declined by 32%. Three (8%) of 39 admissions regarded unrecognized Covid-19 overlapping or misinterpreted with urgent urologic conditions such as fever-associated urinary stones or hematuria. In spite of a significant reduction of activity, a non-negligible portion of admissions to our Covid-free unit regarded unrecognized Covid-19. In order to preserve its integrity, we propose an enhanced triage prior to the admission to a Covid-free unit including not only routine questions on fever and respiratory symptoms but also nonrespiratory symptoms, history of exposure, and a survey about the social and geographic origin of the patient.","Luciani, Lorenzo G; Mattevi, Daniele; Giusti, Guido; Proietti, Silvia; Gallo, Fabrizio; Schenone, Maurizio; Malossini, Gianni",Urology,,250

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify potential failure points in a new chemotherapy preparation technology and to implement changes that prevent or minimize the consequences of those failures before they occur using the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) approach. METHODS: An FMEA was conducted by a team of medication safety pharmacists, oncology pharmacists and technicians, leadership from informatics, investigational drug, and medication safety services, and representatives from the technology vendor. Failure modes were scored using both Risk Priority Number (RPN) and Risk Hazard Index (RHI) scores. RESULTS: The chemotherapy preparation workflow was defined in a 41-step process with 16 failure modes. The RPN and RHI scores were identical for each failure mode because all failure modes were considered detectable. Five failure modes, all attributable to user error, were deemed to pose the highest risk. Mitigation strategies and system changes were identified for 2 failure modes, with subsequent system modifications resulting in reduced risk. CONCLUSION: The FMEA was a useful tool for risk mitigation and workflow optimization prior to implementation of an intravenous compounding technology. The process of conducting this study served as a collaborative and proactive approach to reducing the potential for medication errors upon adoption of new technology into the chemotherapy preparation process.","Feemster, Agnes Ann; Augustino, Melissa; Duncan, Rosemary; Khandoobhai, Anand; Rowcliffe, Meghan",Am. j. health system pharm,,250

Regarding the clinical implications of genetic information, little is known about the lifelong clinical effect of sarcomere mutations in Japanese HCM patients.MethodsâandâResults:We studied 211 consecutive Japanese patients with HCM who had agreed to genetic testing between 2003 and 2013. Genetic analyses were performed by direct DNA sequencing in the 6 common sarcomere genes (MYH7,MYBPC3,TNNT2,TNNI3,TPM1,ACTC). Through variant filtering, 21 mutations were identified in 67 patients. After excluding 8 patients whose variants were determined as having uncertain significance, finally 203 patients (130 men, age at study entry: 61.8±14.1 years) were investigated for clinical presentation and course. At the time of study entry, patients with mutations were younger, had more frequent non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, had greater interventricular wall thickness, were more frequently in the dilated phase and less frequently had apical HCM. Through their lifetimes, a total of 98 HCM-related morbid events occurred in 72 patients. Survival analysis revealed that patients with sarcomere gene mutations experienced those morbid events significantly more frequently, and this tendency was more prominent for lethal arrhythmic events. CONCLUSIONS: In our HCM cohort, patients with sarcomere gene mutations had poorer lifelong outcome. Genetic information is considered important for better management of HCM.","Nakashima, Yasuteru; Kubo, Toru; Sugiura, Kenta; Ochi, Yuri; Takahashi, Asa; Baba, Yuichi; Hirota, Takayoshi; Yamasaki, Naohito; Kimura, Akinori; Doi, Yoshinori L; Kitaoka, Hiroaki",Cir. j,,250

Variable definitions, selection bias, mainly retrospective analyses of hospitalized patients and different methodologies are implemented in the research of this new disease. Central nervous system (CNS) pathology presents most frequently features of non-specific neuroinflammation with microglial activation and lymphoid infiltrations, ischemic/hypoxic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disease, and microthrombi. Some brain specimens remain unaffected or show only non-specific changes of the critical status. Interpretations of the neuropathological findings are not always balanced in a clinical context and discrepant in consequence. Designing of longitudinal neuropathological studies, more frequent autopsies, and building of COVID-19 brain banks, together with neuroimaging analyses is essential. Genetic predispositions or immunological factors corresponding to the disease profile as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum biomarkers of COVID-19, the impact of different virus variants and influence of the therapy need to be identified.

Our evaluations, based on a large data-set from the US CPI-U index, indicate that the HRNN model significantly outperforms a vast array of well-known inflation prediction baselines.","Barkan, Oren; Caspi, Itamar; Hammer, Allon; Koenigstein, Noam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07920v2.pdf,250

435702,Ideas for how informaticians can get involved with COVID-19 research,2020,"Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by a progressive fibro-fatty replacement of the working myocardium and by life-threatening arrhythmias and risk of sudden cardiac death. Pathogenic variants are identified in nearly 50% of affected patients mostly in genes encoding for desmosomal proteins. AC incomplete penetrance and phenotypic variability advocate that other factors than genetics may modulate the disease, such as microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs with a primary role in gene expression regulation and network of cellular processes. The implication of miRNAs in AC pathogenesis and their role as biomarkers for early disease detection or differential diagnosis has been the objective of multiple studies employing diverse designs and methodologies to detect miRNAs and measure their expression levels. Here we summarize experiments, evidence, and flaws of the different studies and hitherto knowledge of the implication of miRNAs in AC pathogenesis and diagnosis.","Bueno Marinas, Maria; Celeghin, Rudy; Cason, Marco; Thiene, Gaetano; Basso, Cristina; Pilichou, Kalliopi",,,250
435703,Ideas for how informaticians can get involved with COVID-19 research,2020,"In addition to acting as a transcriptional coactivator, YAP1 directly mediates translocalization of the pro-oncogenic phosphatase SHP2 from the cytoplasm to nucleus. In the cytoplasm, SHP2 potentiates RAS-ERK signaling, which promotes cell proliferation and cell motility, while in the nucleus, it mediates gene regulation. As a result, elucidating the details of SHP2 trafficking is important for understanding its biological roles, including in cancer. YAP1 comprises multiple splicing isoforms defined in part by the presence (as in YAP1-2Î³) or absence (as in YAP1-2&#945;) of a Î³-segment encoded by exon 6 that disrupts a critical leucine zipper. While the disruptive segment is known to reduce coactivator function, it is unclear how this element impacts the physical and functional relationships between YAP1 and SHP2. To explore this question, we first demonstrated that YAP1-2Î³ cannot bind SHP2. Nevertheless, YAP1-2Î³ exhibits stronger mitogenic and motogenic activities than does YAP1-2&#945; because the YAP1-2&#945;-mediated delivery of SHP2 to the nucleus weakens cytoplasmic RAS-ERK signaling. However, YAP1-2Î³ confers less in vivo tumorigenicity than does YA1-2&#945; by recruiting tumor-inhibitory macrophages. Mechanistically, YAP1-2Î³ transactivates and the YAP1-2&#945;-SHP2 complex transrepresses the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant CCL2. Thus, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic pro-oncogenic YAP1 activities are inversely regulated by alternative splicing of exon 6. Notably, oncogenic KRAS downregulates the SRSF3 splicing factor that prevents exon 6 skipping, thereby creating a YAP1-2&#945;-dominant situation that supports a ""cold"" immune microenvironment.","Ben, Chi; Wu, Xiaojing; Takahashi-Kanemitsu, Atsushi; Knight, Christopher Takaya; Hayashi, Takeru; Hatakeyama, Masanori",J. biol. chem,,250

436111,E-Triage Systems for COVID-19 Outbreak: Review and Recommendations,2021,"BACKGROUND: Commercial availability of serological tests to evaluate immunoglobulins (Ig) targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has grown exponentially since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Thorough validation of these tests is important before use as epidemiological tools to infer seroprevalence in specific populations and as diagnostic tools to complement molecular approaches (e.g., quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). METHODS: Commercial serological tests from 11 suppliers were assayed side-by-side using 126 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected inpatients and 36 from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. RESULTS: The majority of the tests assayed have >95% specificity. For the sensitivity calculation, samples were stratified by days since symptoms onset; sensitivity peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum 91.2%, Euroimmun) and, dependant on the test, at 16-21 or >21 days for IgG (maximum 94.1%, Snibe). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with a severe clinical presentation have lower levels of Ig targeting SARS-CoV-2 at <10 days since symptoms onset and higher levels at >21 days, compared to patients with a non-severe presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the heterogeneity of sensitivity and generally high specificity of the serological tests and establishes a basis for their usefulness to complement diagnostic techniques and population seroprevalence studies.","Serre-Miranda, C; Nobrega, C; Roque, S; Canto-Gomes, J; Silva, C S; Vieira, N; Barreira-Silva, P; Alves-Peixoto, P; Cotter, J; Reis, A; Formigo, M; Sarmento, H; Pires, O; Carvalho, A; Petrovykh, D Y; Diéguez, L; Sousa, J C; Sousa, N; Capela, C; Palha, J A; Cunha, P G; Correia-Neves, M",Int J Infect Dis,,250

The objective of the present study is to identify specific clinical features of cases of GBS reported in the literature associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched Pubmed, and included single case reports and case series with full text in English, reporting original data of patients with GBS and a confirmed recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data were extracted.We identified 28 articles (22 single case reports and 6 case series), reporting on a total of 44 GBS patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed through serum RT-PCR in 72.7% of cases. A total of 40 patients (91%) had symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection before the onset of the GBS. The median period between the onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms of the GBS was 11.2 days (range, 2-23). The most common clinical features were: leg weakness (61.4%), leg parethesia (50%), arm weakness (50.4%), arm paresthesia (50.4%), hyporeflexia/areflexia (48%), and ataxia (22.7%). 38.6% (n = 17) were found to have facial paralysis. Among 37 patients in whom nerve-conduction studies and electromyography were performed, of which 14 patients (31.8%) were consistent with the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) subtype of the GBS. The present retrospective analysis support the role of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the development of the GBS, may trigger GBS as para-infectious disease, and lead to SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS.","Li, Xiujun; Wang, Yanchao; Wang, Hongquan; Wang, Yumin",QJM,,250
436621,Reviewing COVID-19 Literature on Business Management: What It Portends for Future Research?,2021,"Covid-19 is a recently-emerged infectious disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV2. SARS-CoV2 differs from previous coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS) due to its high infectivity (reproduction value, R0, typically 2-4) and pre- or asymptomatic transmission, properties that have contributed to the current global Covid-19 pandemic. Identified risk factors for disease severity and death from SARS-Cov2 infection include older age, male sex, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. The reasons for these associations are still largely obscure. Evidence is also emerging that SARS-CoV2 infection exacerbates the underlying pathophysiology of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. Here, we discuss potential mechanisms through which diabetes may affect the risk of more severe outcomes in Covid-19 and, additionally, how diabetic emergencies and longer term pathology may be aggravated by infection with the virus. We consider roles for the immune system, the observed phenomenon of microangiopathy in severe Covid-19 infection and the potential for direct viral toxicity on metabolically-relevant tissues including pancreatic beta cells and targets of insulin action.","Muniangi-Muhitu, Hermine; Akalestou, Elina; Salem, Victoria; Misra, Shivani; Oliver, Nicholas S; Rutter, Guy A",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,250

In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. CHALLENGES: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management. PURPOSE: This commentary aims to summarise some of the potential mental health and psychosocial challenges that may arise in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","O039,; Neil, Adriene; Nicholls, Stephen J; Redfern, Julie; Brown, Alex; Hare, David L",Heart lung circ,,250

439768,A Fuzzy Graph Approach Analysis for COVID-19 Outbreak,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The current paper examines the intersection between social vulnerability, individual risk, and social/psychological resources with adult suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Data come from a national sample (n =10, 368) of U.S. adults. Using an online platform, information was gathered the third week of March 2020, and post-stratification weighted to proportionally represent the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and geography. RESULTS: Nearly 15 percent of sampled respondents were categorized as high risk, scoring 7+ on the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R). This level of risk varied across social vulnerability groupings: Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, families with children, unmarried, and younger respondents reported higher SBQ-R scores than their counterparts (p < 0.000). Regression results confirm these bivariate differences, and also reveal that risk factors (food insecurity, physical symptoms, and CES-D symptomatology) are positive and significantly related to suicidality (p < 0.000). Additionally, resource measures are significant and negatively related to suicidality (p < 0.000).

Passive immune therapy with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy was utilized as an investigational therapy. We designed an open label study and received an investigational new drug (IND) number from the Food and Drug Administration for the study on April 11, 2020. Methods:Patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled and identical ABO CCP was administered. CCP was collected from recovered COVID-19 patients by our hospital blood donor services in line with FDA guidelines. Patients could receive up to three doses of CCP and each dose came from a different donor to potentiate therapeutic response. Subjects were followed for 28 days after infusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in hospital or with weekly phone calls if discharged home. Results:45 patients received CCP through the study period of April 24th through August 21st. The median age was 60 (range: 16-87), and two thirds were male (n=30) with Hispanic predominance (58%). Patients also received supplemental therapies such as remdesivir, tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and inhaled nitric oxide. Twenty-six recipients received 1 dose, 12 received 2 doses, and 7 received 3 doses of CCP all of which were collected internally by the hospital blood donor center. 22 recipients were O positive, 17 were A positive, and 6 were B positive. During their hospital course, 18 patients were on mechanical ventilation, 3 of which were on ECMO, 19 were on high-flow nasal cannula, and 8 were on low-flow nasal cannula as the highest level of oxygen therapy. At the 28 day follow up, 14 patients were deceased (31%), 4 (9%) were still hospitalized, and 27 (60%) were discharged home. Two patients had a suspected transfusion related reaction that resolved with supportive care including diphenhydramine and furosemide. Conclusion:We designed and implemented a pragmatic study to provide a treatment option for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Sixty percent of our very sick study population survived to hospital discharge and there were only two transient infusion reactions. While larger studies with a control group are necessary to more clearly evaluate the benefit of CCP in COVID-19, our study lays the foundation for the rapid implementation of a Convalescent Plasma Program for possible future pandemics as a bridge to vaccine and therapeutic trials.","Collins, A.

441303,COVIDECONOMICS: The Evaluation of COVID-19 Economic Effects (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: The pressures exerted by the pandemic of COVID-19 pose an unprecedented demand on health care services. Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence. METHODS: We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was re-parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model). RESULTS: The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. CONCLUSIONS: The models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.","Donker, Tjibbe; Bürkin, Fabian; Wolkewitz, Martin; Haverkamp, Christian; Christoffel, Dominic; Kappert, Oliver; Hammer, Thorsten; Busch, Hans-Jörg; Biever, Paul; Kalbhenn, Johannes; Bürkle, Hartmut; Kern, Winfried; Wenz, Frederik; Grundmann, Hajo",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,250

INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention group will receive the anticoagulant bivalirudin intravenously with a target aPTT of 45-70 sec for three days while the control group will stay on the standard treatment with low-molecular-weight heparins /unfractionated heparin subcutaneously (see scheme in Additional file 1). All other treatment will be unchanged and left to the attending physicians. MAIN OUTCOMES: As a surrogate parameter for clinical improvement and primary outcome we will use the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio. RANDOMISATION: After inclusion, the patients will be randomized using a closed envelope method into the conventional treatment group, which uses the standard strategy and the experimental group which receives anticoagulation treatment with bivalirudin using an allocation ratio of 1:1. BLINDING (MASKING): Due to logistical and safety reasons (assessment of aPTT to titrate the study drug) only the data-analyst will be blinded to the groups. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We performed a sample size calculation and assumed the data for P/F ratio (according to literature) is normally distributed and used the mean which would be: 160 and SD is 80. We expect the treatment will improve this by 30%. In order to reach a power of 80% we would need 44 patients per group (in total 88 patients). Taking approximately 10% of dropout into account we will include 100 patients (50 in each group). TRIAL STATUS: The local registration number is MRC-05-082 with the protocol version number 2. The date of approval is 18th June 2020. Recruitment started on 28th June and is expected to end in November 2020.

Anticoagulants are efficacious, but their optimal preventive doses are unknown. The present study was aimed to compare different enoxaparin doses/kg of body weight in the prevention of clot complications in COVID-19 pneumonia. Retrospective data from a cohort of adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, never underwent to oropharyngeal intubation before admission, were collected in an Internal Medicine environments equipped for non-invasive ventilation. Unfavorable outcomes were considered as: deep venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, cardiovascular death. Fourteen clinical thromboembolic events among 42 hospitalized patients were observed. Patients were divided into two group on the basis of median heparin dose (0.5 mg-or 50 IU-for kg). The decision about heparin dosing was patient by patient. Higher enoxaparin therapy (mean 0.62±0.16 mg/kg) showed a better thromboprophylactic action (HR=0.2, p=0.04) with respect to lower doses (mean 0.42±0.06 mg/kg), independently from the clinical presentation of the disease. Therefore, COVID-19 pneumonia might request higher enoxaparin doses to reduce thromboembolic events in hospitalized patients, even if outside intensive care units.","Carallo, Claudio; Pugliese, Fabiola; Vettorato, Elisa; Tripolino, Cesare; Delle Donne, Livia; Guarrera, Giovanni; Spagnolli, Walter; Cozzio, Susanna",J. invest. med,,250

443797,"The COVID-19, migration and livelihood in India: Challenges and policy issues",2020,"Despite progress in understanding the pathophysiology of acute lung damage, currently approved treatment possibilities are limited to lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning, and supportive interventions. Various pharmacological approaches have also been tested, with neuromuscular blockers and corticosteroids considered as the most promising. However, inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) also exert a broad spectrum of favorable effects potentially beneficial in acute lung damage. This article reviews pharmacological action and therapeutical potential of nonselective and selective PDE inhibitors and summarizes the results from available studies focused on the use of PDE inhibitors in animal models and clinical studies, including their adverse effects. The data suggest that xanthines as representatives of nonselective PDE inhibitors may reduce acute lung damage, and decrease mortality and length of hospital stay. Various (selective) PDE3, PDE4, and PDE5 inhibitors have also demonstrated stabilization of the pulmonary epithelial-endothelial barrier and reduction the sepsis- and inflammation-increased microvascular permeability, and suppression of the production of inflammatory mediators, which finally resulted in improved oxygenation and ventilatory parameters. However, the current lack of sufficient clinical evidence limits their recommendation for a broader use. A separate chapter focuses on involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and PDE-related changes in its metabolism in association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The chapter illuminates perspectives of the use of PDE inhibitors as an add-on treatment based on actual experimental and clinical trials with preliminary data suggesting their potential benefit.","Mokra, Daniela; Mokry, Juraj",Int. j. mol. sci.

444140,The United States and the Transatlantic Relationship,2020,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, whose progression and stability are modulated, among other factors, by an innate and adaptive immune response. Prodiginines are bacterial secondary metabolites with antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities; however, their effect on the progression or vulnerability of atheromatous plaque has not been evaluated. This study assessed the therapeutic potential of prodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin on inflammatory marker expression and atherosclerosis. An in vitro and in vivo study was carried out. Migration, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and angiogenesis assays were performed on cell types involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. In addition, male LDL receptor null (Ldlr-/-) C57BL/6J mice were treated with prodigiosin or undecylprodigiosin for 28 days. Morphometric analysis of atherosclerotic plaques, gene expression of atherogenic factors in the aortic sinus and serum cytokine quantification were performed. The treatments applied had slight effects on the in vitro tests performed, highlighting the inhibitory effect on the migration of SMCs (smooth muscle cells). On the other hand, although no significant difference in atherosclerotic plaque progression was observed, gene expression of IL-4 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2) was downregulated. In addition, 50 µg/Kg/day of both treatments was sufficient to inhibit circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) in serum. These results suggested that prodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin modulated inflammatory markers and could have an impact in reducing atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability.","Cuevas, Alejandro; Saavedra, Nicolás; Salazar, Luis A; Cavalcante, Marcela F; Silva, Jacqueline C; Abdalla, Dulcineia S P",,,250
444141,The United States and the Transatlantic Relationship,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Although calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) is common, there are no published outcome domains or validated measurement instruments for CPPD studies. In this paper, we describe the framework for development of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) CPPD Core Domain Sets. METHODS: The OMERACT CPPD working group performed a scoping literature review and qualitative interview study. Generated outcomes were presented at the 2020 OMERACT CPPD virtual Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting with discussion focused on whether different core domain sets should be developed for different calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) clinical presentations and how the future CPPD Core Domain Set may overlap with already established osteoarthritis (OA) domains. These discussions informed development of a future work plan for development of the OMERACT CPPD Core Domain Sets. FINDINGS: Domains identified from a scoping review of 112 studies and a qualitative interview study of 36 people (28 patients with CPPD, 7 health care professionals, one stakeholder) were mapped to core areas of OMERACT Filter 2.1. The majority of SIG participants agreed there was need to develop separate core domain sets for ""short term"" and ""long term"" studies of CPPD. Although CPPD + OA is common and core domain sets for OA have been established, participants agreed that existing OA core domain sets should not influence the development of OMERACT core domain sets for CPPD. Prioritization exercises (using Delphi methodology) will consider 40 potential domains for short term studies of CPPD and 47 potential domains for long term studies of CPPD. CONCLUSION: Separate OMERACT CPPD Core Domain Sets will be developed for ""short term"" studies for an individual flare of acute CPP crystal arthritis and for ""long term"" studies that may include participants with any clinical presentation of CPPD (acute CPP crystal arthritis, chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis, and/or CPPD + OA).","Cai, Ken; Fuller, Amy; Zhang, Yiling; Hensey, Owen; Grossberg, David; Christensen, Robin; Shea, Beverley; Singh, Jasvinder A; McCarthy, Geraldine M; Rosenthal, Ann K; Filippou, Georgios; Taylor, William J; Diaz-Torne, Cesar; Stamp, Lisa K; Edwards, N Lawrence; Pascart, Tristan; Becce, Fabio; Nielsen, Sabrina M; Tugwell, Peter; Beaton, Dorcas; Abhishek, Abhishek; Tedeschi, Sara K; Dalbeth, Nicola",Semin. arthritis rheum,,250

There is a pressing need to understand how the virus counteracts host innate immune responses. Deleterious clinical manifestations of coronaviruses have been associated with virus-induced direct dysregulation of innate immune responses occurring via viral macrodomains located within nonstructural protein-3 (Nsp3). However, no substantial information is available concerning the relationship of macrodomains to the unusually high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that structural evolution of macrodomains may impart a critical role to the unique pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Using sequence, structural, and phylogenetic analysis, we identify a specific set of historical substitutions that recapitulate the evolution of the macrodomains that counteract host immune response. These evolutionary substitutions may alter and reposition the secondary structural elements to create new intra-protein contacts and, thereby, may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit host immunity. Further, we find that the unusual virulence of this virus is potentially the consequence of Darwinian selection-driven epistasis in protein evolution. Our findings warrant further characterization of macrodomain-specific evolutionary substitutions in in vitro and in vivo models to determine their inhibitory effects on the host immune system.","Hussain, Irfan; Pervaiz, Nashaiman; Khan, Abbas; Saleem, Shoaib; Shireen, Huma; Wei, Dong-Qing; Labrie, Viviane; Bao, Yiming; Abbasi, Amir Ali",Genes immun,,250

METHODS: Disease Outbreak Response (DORS) measures implemented at our center and its satellite clinics included strict infection prevention, manpower preservation, prudent resource allocation, and adaptation of standard-of-care treatments. Critical day-to-day clinical operations, number of persons screened before entry, staff temperature monitoring, and personal protection equipment stockpile were reviewed as a dashboard at daily DORS taskforce huddles. Polymerase chain reaction swab tests performed for patients and staff who met defined criteria for testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were tracked. Descriptive statistics of outpatient attendances and treatment caseloads from February 3 to May 23, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: We performed COVID-19 swabs for 80 patients and 93 staff, detecting three cancer patients with community-acquired COVID-19 infections with no nosocomial transmission. Patients who required chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery and patients who are on maintenance treatment continued to receive timely treatment without disruption. The number of intravenous chemotherapy treatments was maintained at 97.8% compared with 2019, whereas that of weekly radiotherapy treatments remained stable since December 2019. All cancer-related surgeries proceeded without delay, with a 0.3% increase in workload. Surveillance follow-ups were conducted via teleconsultation, accounting for a 30.7% decrease in total face-to-face clinic consultations. CONCLUSION: Through the coordinated efforts of a DORS taskforce, it is possible to avoid nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmissions among patients and staff without compromising on care delivery at a national cancer center.","Kwek, Jin Wei; Chan, Jack J; Kanesvaran, Ravindran; Wang, Michael L C; Neo, Patricia S H; Chia, Claramae S; Tham, Chee Kian; Chew, Lita S T; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Yap, Swee Peng; Dent, Rebecca A; Hwang, William Y K; Lim, Soon Thye",JCO Oncol Pract,,250

Social innovation resonates with the challenges the pandemic presents. This paper aims to address the question of which form of social innovation will be most pivotal in the post-pandemic world. Design/methodology/approach: The paper has been developed by reviewing key literature on social innovation, with a specific focus on the most current contributions of Moulaert and MacCallum and Mulgan. Findings: Social innovation is embedded in debates around social change but the “type” of social change that dominates the future of social innovation is connected to how social innovation interacts at different scales and with different actors engaged in shaping change in specific contexts. Building upon extant knowledge of social innovation we can hypothesise two paths of social innovation emerging/intensifying: one that seeks economic reform with an emphasis on meeting social needs in new ways and another that seeks complete systemic change.

We draw on a number of key sources, including key papers and book chapters, discussion forums, agency reports, and conference presentations. We develop the potential dimensions of patient-based evidence, describe its key attributes, and consider its future development. Patient-based evidence has the potential to be a key concept in HTA, comprised of a series of related elements of importance to patients. We recognize that we raise more questions than can be answered, but as an emerging concept, recognition and understanding of patient-based evidence is still developing. The concepts and methods that support its application in HTA require urgent development. We conclude that clinical and economic forms of evidence are not enough for HTA. For HTA to be complete, we need to consider all relevant aspects of the phenomena, including patient-based evidence.

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of liver steatosis and fibrosis in patients with COVID-19 and their association with clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was conducted. The risk for liver steatosis was estimated by HSI > 36, and risk for advanced liver fibrosis with APRI > 1.0, NAFLD FS > 0.675 and/or FIB-4 > 3.25. Clinical outcomes were admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and mortality. RESULTS: Of 155 patients, 71.6% were male (n = 111), and 28.4% (n = 44) were obese. Abnormal LFT were present in 96.8% (n = 150), prevalence of steatosis was 42.6% (n = 66) and of significative liver fibrosis was 44.5% (n = 69). Liver fibrosis by FIB-4 was associated with risk of ICU admission (OR 1.74 [95%CI 1.74-2.68; p = 0.023]) and mortality (OR 6.45 [95%CI 2.01-20.83, p = 0.002]); no independent associations were found. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of steatosis and significant liver fibrosis was high in COVID-19 patients but was not associated with clinical outcomes.","Lopez-Mendez, Ivan; Aquino-Matus, Jorge; Gall, Sofia Murua-Beltrán; Prieto-Nava, Jose D; Juarez-Hernandez, Eva; Uribe, Misael; Castro-Narro, Graciela",Ann Hepatol,,250
453295,Mass vaccination in a roaring pandemic,2021-09-19,"INTRODUCTION: Some local protocols suggest using intermediate or therapeutic doses of anticoagulants for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the incidence of bleeding, predictors of major bleeding, or the association between bleeding and mortality remain largely unknown. METHODS: We performed a cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that received intermediate or therapeutic doses of anticoagulants from March 25 to July 22, 2020, to identify those at increased risk for major bleeding. We used bivariate and multivariable logistic regression to explore the risk factors associated with major bleeding. RESULTS: During the study period, 1965 patients were enrolled. Of them, 1347 (69%) received intermediate- and 618 (31%) therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, with a median duration of 12 days in both groups. During the hospital stay, 112 patients (5.7%) developed major bleeding and 132 (6.7%) had non-major bleeding. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate for major bleeding was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36%-54%) and for non-major bleeding 32% (95% CI: 24%-40%). Multivariable analysis showed increased risk for in-hospital major bleeding associated with D-dimer levels >10 times the upper normal range (hazard ratio [HR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.38-3.59), ferritin levels >500 ng/ml (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.02-3.95), critical illness (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.14-3.18), and therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01-1.97). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 receiving intermediate- or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation, a major bleeding event occurred in 5.7%. Use of therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation, critical illness, and elevated D-dimer or ferritin levels at admission were associated with increased risk for major bleeding.","Demelo-Rodriguez, Pablo; Farfán-Sedano, Ana Isabel; Pedrajas, José María; Llamas, Pilar; Sigüenza, Patricia; Jaras, María Jesús; Quintana-Diaz, Manuel; Fernández-Capitán, Carmen; Bikdeli, Behnood; Jiménez, David; Monreal, Manuel",J Thromb Haemost,,250
454202,Influence of Community and Culture in the Ethical Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources in a Pandemic Situation: Deliberative Democracy Study,2020,"It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 as a receptor to gain entry into human cells, in a way similar to that of SARS-CoV. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may help clinicians and researchers gain more insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and design therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","Li, Guoping; He, Xiang; Zhang, Lei; Ran, Qin; Wang, Junyi; Xiong, Anying; Wu, Dehong; Chen, Feng; Sun, Jinlyu; Chang, Christopher",J Autoimmun,,250

Going beyond a cause of disease or death, they can have consequences in many aspects, psychological, social and economic ones being in the first place. The Covid-19 outbreak, which first emerged in China and has spread to the whole world as of the first months of 2020, has the potential to constitute a breaking the course of history, as well. Turkey is located on the transit point between Asia and Europe with its geographical position, and thus, received its share from the outbreak of Covid-19, which spreads through social contact. The first official case was recorded on 11 March 2020, and then the virus spread rapidly. This study aims to assess the attitude of the public towards Covid-19 at times when the impact of the disease reached maximum. To this end, data were collected from 1586 people with different socio-demographic features through Covid-19 Pandemic Community Scale. The impact of the pandemic on the society was measured in three dimensions as Sensitivity to Pandemic, Protection against Pandemic and Social Trust. The research results showed that the people had high levels of sensitivity to the pandemic, exerted the maximum effort for protection and social trust was above the average although it fell behind the other dimensions. As a consequence, it can be concluded that Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the Turkish people.","Bostan, Sedat; Erdem, Ramazan; Öztürk, Yunus Emre; Kılıç, Taşkın; Yılmaz, Ali",Electro. J.

Cancer treatment of patients who belong to external centres, namely spoke centres, could be organized in different pathways according to the grade of involvement and/or availability of the medical team of the spoke centre. Moreover, dedicated areas should be created for the management and treatment of patients who developed COVID-19 symptoms after hospitalization (i.e., dedicated wards, operation rooms and intensive care beds). Lastly, hospital staff must be highly trained for both preventing COVID-19 contagion and treating patients who develop the infection.

Although LIDs offer sustainable runoff management, these infrastructures can be considered a risk to public health due to the presence of pathogens in the runoff and human exposure to contaminated water held in and transported by LIDs. The objective of this study is to examine the disease burden of Gastrointestinal illness (GI) from exposure to LIDs at the residential, neighbourhood, and municipal levels. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of literature on three water features: (1) harvested rainwater obtained from LIDs, (2) surface water, and (3) floodwater. A set of 32 studies were systematically selected to collect values of risks of infection and expressed as the disease burden, i.e. disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The results showed that the percentage of GI illness exceeding the health guidelines were high for harvested rainwater, i.e. 22% of annual disease burden exceeded the WHO guidelines (0.001 DALYs/1000 persons), and 2% exceeded the US EPA guidelines (5.75 DALYs/1000 bathers). Among the six exposures for harvested rainwater, exposure to spray irrigation, exceeded US EPA guidelines whereas; five exposures, i.e. flushing, hosing, daily shower, spray irrigation, and children playing, surpassed the WHO guidelines. Considering LID treatment, the values of annual disease burden from all the selected barriers were below US EPA guidelines however, these values exceeded the WHO guidelines for three barriers i.e. water plaza, grass swale, and open storage ponds. These findings provide a broader perspective of the disease burden associated with LIDs and emphasise to consider the type of exposures and required treatment barriers for developing LID infrastructures in urban areas.","Ishaq, Sadia; Sadiq, Rehan; Farooq, Shaukat; Chhipi-Shrestha, Gyan; Hewage, Kasun",Sci Total Environ,,250

OBJECTIVE: Describe the COVID-19 pandemic experiences of and effects on individuals participating in the HERO registry. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered registry enrollment survey conducted from April 10 to July 31, 2020. SETTING: Participants worked in hospitals (74.4%), outpatient clinics (7.4%), and other settings (18.2%) located throughout the nation. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14,600 healthcare workers. MAIN MEASURES: COVID-19 exposure, viral and antibody testing, diagnosis of COVID-19, job burnout, and physical and emotional distress. KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 42.0 years, 76.4% were female, 78.9% were White, 33.2% were nurses, 18.4% were physicians, and 30.3% worked in settings at high risk for COVID-19 exposure (e.g., ICUs, EDs, COVID-19 units). Overall, 43.7% reported a COVID-19 exposure and 91.3% were exposed at work. Just 3.8% in both high- and low-risk settings experienced COVID-19 illness. In regression analyses controlling for demographics, professional role, and work setting, the risk of COVID-19 illness was higher for Black/African-Americans (aOR 2.32, 99% CI 1.45, 3.70, p < 0.01) and Hispanic/Latinos (aOR 2.19, 99% CI 1.55, 3.08, p < 0.01) compared with Whites. Overall, 41% responded that they were experiencing job burnout. Responding about the day before they completed the survey, 53% of participants reported feeling tired a lot of the day, 51% stress, 41% trouble sleeping, 38% worry, 21% sadness, 19% physical pain, and 15% anger. On average, healthcare workers reported experiencing 2.4 of these 7 distress feelings a lot of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at high risk for COVID-19 exposure, but rates of COVID-19 illness were low. The greater risk of COVID-19 infection among race/ethnicity minorities reported in the general population is also seen in healthcare workers. The HERO registry will continue to monitor changes in healthcare worker well-being during the pandemic.

This posed new challenges for university students. Based on the classification proposed in the Mental Health Continuum model by Keyes, the aims were to estimate university students' prevalence of mental health during lookdown outbreak, and to examine the associations between mental health and, respectively, academic stress, self-efficacy, satisfaction for degree course, locus of control, COVID-19 risk perception, taking into account the level of information seeking about pandemic. Overall, 1124 Italian university students completed a self-report questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational analyses. Results showed that 22.3% of participants were flourishing, and levels of mental well-being appeared in line with normative values in young Italian adults; levels of academic stress were not significantly higher than those found in other student samples before the COVID-19 outbreak. Students with high levels of information seeking presented higher levels of well-being and risk perception. Results could be considered useful to realize training pathways, to help the university students to improve their well-being, post-pandemic.","Capone, Vincenza; Caso, Daniela; Donizzetti, Anna Rosa; Procentese, Fortuna",Sustainability,,250

It has been shown that periods of isolation may induce a spike in alcohol use disorder (AUD). In addition, alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is the most common consequence of excessive alcohol consumption worldwide. Moreover, liver impairment has also been reported as a common manifestation of COVID-19. AIMS: The aim of our position paper was to consider some critical issues regarding the management of ALD in patients with AUD in the era of COVID-19. METHODS: A panel of experts of the Italian Society of Alcohology (SIA) met via ""conference calls"" during the lockdown period to draft the SIA's criteria for the management of ALD in patients with COVID-19 as follows: (a) liver injury in patients with ALD and COVID-19 infection; (b) toxicity to the liver of the drugs currently tested to treat COVID-19 and the pharmacological interaction between medications used to treat AUD and to treat COVID-19; (c) reorganization of the management of compensated and decompensated ALD and liver transplantation in the COVID-19 era. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly carried us toward a new governance scenario of AUD and ALD which necessarily requires an in-depth review of the management of these diseases with a new safe approach (management of out-patients and in-patients following new rules of safety, telemedicine, telehealth, call meetings with clinicians, nurses, patients, and caregivers) without losing the therapeutic efficacy of multidisciplinary treatment.","Testino, Gianni; Vignoli, Teo; Patussi, Valentino; Allosio, Pierluigi; Amendola, Maria Francesca; Aricò, Sarino; Baselice, Aniello; Balbinot, Patrizia; Campanile, Vito; Fanucchi, Tiziana; Greco, Giovanni; Macciò, Livia; Meneguzzi, Cristina; Mioni, Davide; Palmieri, Vincenzo Ostilio; Parisi, Michele; Renzetti, Doda; Rossin, Raffaella; Gandin, Claudia; Bottaro, Luigi Carlo; Bernardi, Mauro; Addolorato, Giovanni; Lungaro, Lisa; Zoli, Giorgio; Scafato, Emanuele; Caputo, Fabio",Dig. dis. sci,,250
463036,The English Patient: Evaluating Local Lockdowns Using Real-Time COVID-19&Consumption Data,2020-10-08,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite its recognized efficacy and tolerability profile, during the last decade a rise of adverse events following ibuprofen administration in children has been reported, including a possible role in worsening the clinical course of infections. Our aim was to critically evaluate the safety of ibuprofen during the course of pediatric infectious disease in order to promote its appropriate use in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Ibuprofen is associated with severe necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) during chickenpox course. Pre-hospital use of ibuprofen seems to increase the risk of complicated pneumonia in children. Conflicting data have been published in septic children, while ibuprofen in the setting of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) exacerbations is safe and efficacious. No data is yet available for ibuprofen use during COVID-19 course. Ibuprofen should not be recommended for chickenpox management. Due to possible higher risks of complicated pneumonia, we suggest caution on its use in children with respiratory symptoms. While it remains unclear whether ibuprofen may have harmful effects during systemic bacterial infection, its administration is recommended in CF course. Despite the lack of data, it is seems cautious to prefer the use of paracetamol during COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome in children.","Quaglietta, Lucia; Martinelli, Massimo; Staiano, Annamaria",Ital J Pediatr,,250

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients treated of OSCC adjacent to DI at A.C. Camargo Cancer Center between 2009 and 2020. RESULTS: Thirty one patients were identified, being women the majority (58.1%). The mean age of the patients was 68.8 years. Never smoker corresponds to 46.9% and never alcohol consumer to 54.9% of the sample. OPMD was reported in 45.2% of patients, affecting mainly women (78.5%). Leukoplakia (63.7%) followed by oral lichen planus (36.3%) was the most common OPMD found in women. OSCC adjacent to DI occurred in the inferior gingiva/alveolar mucosa in 48.3% of cases, and ulceration was the most common clinical appearance (87%). Peri-implantitis (PI) was initial clinical diagnosis in 16.1% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Oral squamous cell carcinoma adjacent to DI was more common in women over 70 years old, non-smokers and non-drinker, and the majority had oral leukoplakia before the diagnosis of OSCC. OSCC may present clinical and radiographic features that resemble PI which can delay the diagnosis and impair the prognosis.","Ramos, Joab Cabral; Alves, Fábio Abreu; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo; Dos Santos-Silva, Alan Roger; Vargas, Pablo Agustin; Lopes, Márcio Ajudarte",Oral dis,,250

466332,"Brazil, South America and Covid-19",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, health care delivery in the USA has been structured around in-person visits. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a shift to virtual care models in order to reduce patient exposure to high-risk environments and to preserve valuable health care resources. This report describes one large primary care system's model for rapid transition to virtual care (RTVC). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A RTVC model was implemented at the VA Connecticut Health Care System (VACHS), which delivers care to over 58,000 veterans. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The RTVC model included immediate virtual care conversion, telework expansion, implementation of virtual respiratory urgent care clinics, and development of standardized note templates. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Outcomes include the rates of primary encounter types, staff teleworking, and utilization of virtual respiratory urgent care clinics. In under 2 weeks, most encounters were transitioned from in-person to virtual care, enabling telework for over half of the medical staff. The majority of virtual visits were telephone encounters, though rates of video visits increased nearly 18-fold. DISCUSSION: The RTVC model demonstrates expeditious and sustained transition to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experiences help inform institutions still reliant on traditional in-person visits, and future pandemic response.","Spelman, Juliette F; Brienza, Rebecca; Walsh, Robert F; Drost, Paul; Schwartz, Amy R; Kravetz, Jeffrey D; Pitkin, Patricia; Ruser, Christopher",J Gen Intern Med,,250

Most critically ill patients have organ injury, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, or liver dysfunction. However, few studies on acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) have been reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19. AIM: To investigate the prevalence and outcomes of AGI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-d mortality. RESULTS: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients out of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of these patients, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. Forty (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, and septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients. Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical variables, a higher incidence of septic shock and 28-d mortality. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (95%CI: 1.374-2.860; P < 0.001), white blood cell (WBC) counts (95%CI: 1.037-1.379; P = 0.014), and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) (95%CI: 1.020-1.340; P = 0.025) were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. CONCLUSION: The incidence of AGI was 86.7%, and hospital mortality was 48.2% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. SOFA scores, WBC counts, and duration of MV were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Patients with worse AGI grades had a higher incidence of septic shock and 28-d mortality.","Sun, Jia-Kui; Liu, Ying; Zou, Lei; Zhang, Wen-Hao; Li, Jing-Jing; Wang, Yu; Kan, Xiao-Hua; Chen, Jiu-Dong; Shi, Qian-Kun; Yuan, Shou-Tao",World J Gastroenterol,,250

The situation is at its worst, overwhelming intensive care unit (ICU) resources and capacity. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a single-center observational case study of 21 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 20, 2020, to April 31, 2020. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest imaging were obtained consecutively during patient care. We identified 21 patients with confirmed COVID-19 severe infection in our ICU. The mean (± standard deviation) age of the patients was 54 ± 10 years; 95% were men, with shortness of breath (90.6%) the most common symptom. Hypertension was identified as a comorbidity in 28.6% of patients. The most common reason for admission to the ICU was hypoxemic respiratory failure, with 80% (17 patients) requiring mechanical ventilation. Half of the patients (10) died between day 1 and day 18, with septic shock as the primary cause of death. Of the 11 surviving patients, five were discharged home, while six were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital ward. Even then, the median length of ICU stay amongst survivors was 18 days. CONCLUSIONS: To date, there are no known effective antiviral agents or specific therapy to treat COVID-19. As severe systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure seems to be the primary cause of death, supportive care in maintaining oxygenation and hemodynamic stability remain the mainstay goals in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Hariyanto, Hori; Yahya, Corry Quando; Aritonang, Ronald Christian Agustinus",J Med Case Rep,,250

Here, we examined the relationship between net mineralization rates and relevant functional genes, as well as fungal species composition and function following Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) invasion of evergreen broadleaf forests, by studying broadleaf forests (non-invaded), mixed bamboo-broadleaf forests (moderately invaded) and bamboo forests (heavily invaded). Fungal species composition and functional genes involved in organic matter decomposition (laccase and cellobiohydrolase), N mineralization (alkaline peptidases) and nitrification (ammonia monooxygenase) were determined via high-throughput sequencing and real-time PCR. Both net ammonification and nitrification rates were generally increased with bamboo invasion into the broadleaf forest, where the net ammonification rate, on average, was 10.8 times higher than the nitrification rate across the three forest types. The fungal species composition and ecological guilds were altered with bamboo invasion, as demonstrated by the increased proportion of saprotrophs but decreased proportion of symbiotrophs in the bamboo forest. The increased net ammonification rate in bamboo forest was positively correlated with both fungal species composition and functional groups, and the fungal lcc gene (for lignin breakdown) abundance explained 67% of the variation of the net ammonification rate. In addition, the gene abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) explained 62% of the variation of net nitrification rate across the three forest types. The increased soil ammonification and nitrification rates following bamboo invasion of broadleaf forests suggest that the bamboo-invasion associated increase in soil N supply provided a positive feedback that facilitated bamboo invasion into broadleaf forests.","Chen, Zhihao; Li, Yongchun; Chang, Scott X; Xu, Qiufang; Li, Yongfu; Ma, Zilong; Qin, Hua; Cai, Yanjiang",Sci Total Environ,,250

Ideally, programmes would resolve backlogs by temporarily expanding capacity; however, in practice, this is often not possible. We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover. The degree to which screening is organised will determine the feasibility of deploying some risk-based strategies, but implementation of age-based risk stratification should be universally feasible.","Castanon, Alejandra; Rebolj, Matejka; Burger, Emily Annika; de Kok, Inge M C M; Smith, Megan A; Hanley, Sharon J B; Carozzi, Francesca Maria; Peacock, Stuart; O039,; Mahony, James F",Lancet Public Health,,250

YouTube has been recognized as a popular source of information in previous disease outbreaks. We analyzed the content on YouTube about n-CoV in English and Mandarin languages. METHODS: YouTube was searched using the terms '2019 novel coronavirus', 'Wuhan virus' and '' (Mandarin for Wuhan virus) on 1st and 2nd February 2020. First 50 videos in each group were analyzed. Videos in other languages, duplicate videos, those without an audio and duration >15 min were excluded .72 videos in English and 42 in Mandarin were reviewed. 2 reviewers classified the videos as useful, misleading or news based on pre specified criterion. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Modified DISCERN index for reliability and medical information and content index (MICI) score were used for content analysis. RESULTS: These videos attracted cumulative 21,288,856 views. 67% of English and 50% Mandarin videos had useful information. The viewership of misleading Mandarin videos was higher than the useful ones. WHO accounted for only 4% of useful videos. Mean DISCERN score for reliability was 3.12/5 and 3.25/5 for English and Mandarin videos respectively. Mean cumulative MICI score of useful videos was low (6.71/25 for English and 6.28/25 for Mandarin). CONCLUSIONS: YouTube viewership during 2019 n-CoV outbreak is higher than previous outbreaks. The medical content of videos is suboptimal International health agencies are underrepresented. Given its popularity, YouTube should be considered as important platform for information dissemination.","Khatri, Priyanka; Singh, Shweta R; Belani, Neeta Kesu; Yeong, Yin Leng; Lohan, Rahul; Lim, Yee Wei; Teo, Winnie Zy",Travel Med Infect Dis,,250

471263,Five Authoritarian Pandemic Messaging Frames and How to Respond,2020,"Potassium is the most important intracellular cation and the kidneys play a pivotal role in potassium homeostasis. Potassium disorder is a common electrolyte abnormality and it increases the risk of death from any cause, particularly cardiovascular events. Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte abnormality encountered post organ transplantation. The etiology is multifactorial, and includes drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors. In certain regards, the clinical picture of post-transplantation hyperkalemia and hypertension resembles that of Gordon syndrome or familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a disorder characterized by over activity of thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter. Effective and safe management of chronic hyperkalemia can be challenging in this special patient population. Despite the significant short-term and long-term side effects, fludrocortisone (a potent synthetic oral mineralocorticoid receptor agonist) has emerged as the default drug of choice for treatment of refractory hyperkalemia in many organ transplant recipients. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of fludrocortisone for management of hyperkalemia in organ transplant recipients remains unknown. This review discusses potassium homeostasis, including the role of the kidneys, and focuses on calcineurin inhibitor-induced hyperkalemia and on the under-appreciated role of thiazide-type diuretic use in management of hyperkalemia and hypertension. We present an illustrative case of post-transplantation hyperkalemia and hypertension with relevant literature.","Hamrahian, Seyed Mehrdad; Fülöp, Tibor",Am. j. med. sci,,250

We aim to investigate the neurological complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed critically ill patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from February 5 to April 2, 2020. Demographic data, clinical and laboratory findings, comorbidities and treatments were collected and analyzed. Results: Among 86 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 54 patients (62.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 66.6 (11.1) years. Overall, 65% patients presented with at least one neurological symptom. Twenty patients (23.3%) had symptoms involving the central nervous system, including delirium, cerebrovascular diseases and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, while 6 patients (7%) had neuromuscular involvement. Seven of 86 patients exhibited new stroke and 6 (7%) cases were ischemic. A significantly higher prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies was observed in patients with ischemic stroke than in those without stroke (83.3 vs. 26.9%, p &lt; 0.05). Patients with ischemic stroke were more likely to have a higher myoglobulin level, and a lower hemoglobin level. Conclusions: The clinical spectrum of neurological complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was broad. Stroke, delirium and neuromuscular diseases are common neurological complications of COVID-19.

We do not find detectable effects of these policies on disease spread or deaths. We find small but measurable effects on mobility that dissipate over time. And we find small, delayed effects on unemployment. We conduct additional analyses that separately assess the effects of expanding versus withdrawing SIP orders and test whether there are spillover effects in other states. Our results are consistent with prior studies showing that SIP orders have accounted for a relatively small share of the mobility trends and economic disruptions associated with the pandemic. We reanalyze two prior studies purporting to show that SIP orders caused large reductions in disease prevalence, and show that those results are not reliable. Our results do not imply that social distancing behavior by individuals, as distinct from SIP policy, is ineffective.","Berry, Christopher R; Fowler, Anthony; Glazer, Tamara; Handel-Meyer, Samantha; MacMillen, Alec",Proc.

CDC examined the changing age distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during May-August by assessing three indicators: COVID-19-like illness-related emergency department (ED) visits, positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Nationwide, the median age of COVID-19 cases declined from 46 years in May to 37 years in July and 38 in August. Similar patterns were seen for COVID-19-like illness-related ED visits and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results in all U.S. Census regions. During June-August, COVID-19 incidence was highest in persons aged 20-29 years, who accounted for >20% of all confirmed cases. The southern United States experienced regional outbreaks of COVID-19 in June. In these regions, increases in the percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among adults aged 20-39 years preceded increases among adults aged &#8805;60 years by an average of 8.7 days (range = 4-15 days), suggesting that younger adults likely contributed to community transmission of COVID-19. Given the role of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (2), strict adherence to community mitigation strategies and personal preventive behaviors by younger adults is needed to help reduce their risk for infection and subsequent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons at higher risk for severe illness.","Boehmer, Tegan K; DeVies, Jourdan; Caruso, Elise; van Santen, Katharina L; Tang, Shichao; Black, Carla L; Hartnett, Kathleen P; Kite-Powell, Aaron; Dietz, Stephanie; Lozier, Matthew; Gundlapalli, Adi V",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,250

A test should have high sensitivity; however, the sensitivity of the PCR test is highly influenced by viral load, which changes over time. Because it is difficult to collect data before the onset of symptoms, the current literature on the sensitivity of the PCR test before symptom onset is limited. In this study, we used a viral dynamics model to track the probability of failing to detect a case of PCR testing over time, including the presymptomatic period. The model was parametrized by using longitudinal viral load data collected from 30 hospitalized patients. The probability of failing to detect a case decreased toward symptom onset, and the lowest probability was observed 2 days after symptom onset and increased afterwards. The probability on the day of symptom onset was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5 to 1.9) and that 2 days before symptom onset was 60.2% (95% CI: 57.1 to 63.2). Our study suggests that the diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR testing should be done carefully, especially when the test is performed before or way after symptom onset.

478136,Human and financial cost of COVID-19,2020-09-24,"Hemostasis disorders play an important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and outcome of COVID-19. First of all, the hemostasis system suffers due to a complicated and severe course of COVID-19. A significant number of COVID-19 patients develop signs of hypercoagulability, thrombocytopenia, and hyperfibrinolysis. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a tendency toward thrombotic complications in the venous and arterial systems, which is the leading cause of death in this disease. Despite the success achieved in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the search for new effective anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and fibrinolytics, as well as their optimal dose strategies, continues to be relevant. The wide therapeutic potential of seaweed sulfated polysaccharides (PSs), including anticoagulant, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic activities, opens up new possibilities for their study in experimental and clinical trials. These natural compounds can be important complementary drugs for the recovery from hemostasis disorders due to their natural origin, safety, and low cost compared to synthetic drugs. In this review, the authors analyze possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the hemostasis disorders observed in the pathological progression of COVID-19, and also focus the attention of researchers on seaweed PSs as potential drugs aimed to correction these disorders in COVID-19 patients. Modern literature data on the anticoagulant, antithrombotic, and fibrinolytic activities of seaweed PSs are presented, depending on their structural features (content and position of sulfate groups on the main chain of PSs, molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and type of glycosidic bonds, the degree of PS chain branching, etc.). The mechanisms of PS action on the hemostasis system and the issues of oral bioavailability of PSs, important for their clinical use as oral anticoagulant and antithrombotic agents, are considered. The combination of the anticoagulant, thrombolytic, and fibrinolytic properties, along with low toxicity and relative cheapness of production, open up prospects for the clinical use of PSs as alternative sources of new anticoagulant and antithrombotic compounds. However, further investigation and clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy.","Kuznetsova, Tatyana A; Andryukov, Boris G; Makarenkova, Ilona D; Zaporozhets, Tatyana S; Besednova, Natalya N; Fedyanina, Ludmila N; Kryzhanovsky, Sergey P; Shchelkanov, Mikhail Yu",Molecules (Basel),,250

The aim of this study is to explore the associations among loneliness, hopelessness, depression, ego-resilience and life satisfaction in a random sample of young adults (N = 337) at a university in the Western Cape of South Africa. Parallel and serial mediation analysis supported the hypothesis that loneliness is associated with hopelessness, which in turn is associated with depression, and that ego-resilience mediates the association between all the negative indices of psychological well-being and life satisfaction. These findings suggest that mental health interventions that boost ego-resilience and target loneliness may help in dealing with the mental health consequences of COVID-19.","Padmanabhanunni, Anita; Pretorius, Tyrone",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,250

478500,Forensic Inspections in the Time of Covid-19,2021,"Since the first case reports in Wuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic and took lives of > 8,35,000 people globally. This single-stranded RNA virus uses Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry into the host cell. Overexpression of ACE2 is mainly observed in hypertensive, diabetic and heart patients that make them prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mitigations strategies were opted globally by the governments to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the implementation of social distancing norms, wearing the facemasks, and spreading awareness using digital platforms. The lack of an approved drug treatment regimen, and non-availability of a vaccine, collectively posed a challenge for mankind to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this scenario, repurposing of existing drugs and old treatment options like convalescent plasma therapy can be one of the potential alternatives to treat the disease. The drug repurposing provides a selection of drugs based on the scientific rationale and with a shorter cycle of clinical trials, while plasma isolated from COVID-19 recovered patients can be a good source of neutralizing antibody to provide passive immunity. In this review, we provide in-depth analysis on these two approaches currently opted all around the world to treat COVID-19 patients. For this, we used ""Boolean Operators"" such as AND, OR & NOT to search relevant research articles/reviews from the PUBMED for the repurposed drugs and the convalescent plasma in the COVID-19 treatment. The repurposed drugs like Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Tenofovir, Remdesivir, Ribavirin, Darunavir, Oseltamivir, Arbidol (Umifenovir), Favipiravir, Anakinra, and Baricitinib are already being used in clinical trials to treat the COVID-19 patients. These drugs have been approved for a different indication and belong to a diverse category such as anti-malarial/anti-parasitic, anti-retroviral/anti-viral, anti-cancer, or against rheumatoid arthritis. Although, the vaccine would be an ideal option for providing active immunity against the SARS-CoV-2, but considering the current situation, drug repurposing and convalescent plasma therapy and repurposed drugs are the most viable option against SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, Pravindra; Sah, Ashok Kumar; Tripathi, Greesham; Kashyap, Anjali; Tripathi, Avantika; Rao, Rashmi; Mishra, Prabhu C; Mallick, Koustav; Husain, Amjad; Kashyap, Manoj Kumar",Mol. cell. biochem,,250

There will be a progressive increase in deferred cases during the pandemic that will require completion within a limited time frame once restrictions ease. We investigated the impact of various levels of increased postpandemic hospital operating capacity on the time to clear the backlog of deferred cases. Methods: We collected data from 4 cardiac surgery programs across 2 health systems. We recorded case rates at baseline and during the COVID-19 pandemic and created a mathematical model to quantify the cumulative surgical backlog based on the projected pandemic duration. We then used the model to predict the time required to clear the backlog depending on the level of increased operating capacity. Results: Cardiac surgery volumes fell to 54% of baseline after restrictions were implemented. Assuming a service restoration date of either June 1 or July 1, we calculated the need to perform 216% or 263% of monthly baseline volume, respectively, to clear the backlog in 1 month. The actual duration required to clear the backlog highly depends on hospital capacity in the post-COVID period, and ranges from 1 to 8 months, depending on when services are restored and the degree of increased capacity. Conclusions: Cardiac surgical operating capacity during the COVID-19 recovery period will have a dramatic impact on the time to clear the deferred cases backlog. Inadequate operating capacity may cause substantial delays and increase morbidity and mortality. If only prepandemic capacity is available, the backlog will never clear.","Salenger, Rawn; Etchill, Eric W; Ad, Niv; Matthew, Thomas; Alejo, Diane; Whitman, Glenn; Lawton, Jennifer S; Lau, Christine L; Gammie, Charles F; Gammie, James S",Ann Thorac Surg,,250

Later in the hospital course, his pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure worsened as result of severe acute mitral valve regurgitation secondary to direct valvular damage from COVID-19 infection. The patient underwent emergent surgical mitral valve replacement. Pathological evaluation of the damaged valve was confirmed to be secondary to COVID-19 infection. The histopathological findings were consistent with prior cardiopulmonary autopsy sections of patients with COVID-19 described in the literature as well as proposed theories regarding ACE2 receptor activity.

Further, sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more severe outcomes in aged men. Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men. CONTENT: The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China. We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging. Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies. CONCLUSION: The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender. The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.","Gebhard, Catherine; Regitz-Zagrosek, Vera; Neuhauser, Hannelore K; Morgan, Rosemary; Klein, Sabra L",Biol Sex Differ,,250
480072,The East-West Divide in Response to COVID-19,2021,"Traditional methods to infer compartmental epidemic models with time-varying dynamics can only capture continuous changes in the dynamic. However, many changes are discontinuous due to sudden interventions, such as city lockdown and opening of field hospitals. To model the discontinuities, this study introduces the tool of total variation regularization, which regulates the temporal changes of the dynamic parameters, such as the transmission rate. To recover the ground truth dynamic, this study designs a novel yet straightforward optimization algorithm, dubbed iterative Nelder-Mead, which repeatedly applies the Nelder-Mead algorithm. Experiments on the simulated data show that the proposed approach can qualitatively reproduce the discontinuities of the underlying dynamics. To extend this research to real data as well as to help researchers worldwide to fight against COVID-19, the author releases his research platform as an open-source package.","Zheng, Wenjie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00412v1.pdf,250

481376,ALSCO-: Fighting back against COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Attention should be paid to delirium in COVID-19 patients, especially older people, since advanced age poses increased risk of both delirium and COVID-19-related death. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize the evidence on prevalence, incidence and mortality of delirium in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search on Pubmed and Embase from inception to December 1, 2020. Three independent reviewers evaluated study eligibility and data extraction, and assessed study quality. Outcomes were analyzed as proportions with 95% confidence interval (CI). We also compared mortality differences in COVID-19 patients using odds ratio. RESULTS: In total, we identified 48 studies with 11,553 COVID-19 patients from 13 countries. Pooled prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 24.3% (95% CI: 19.4-29.6%), 32.4% (95% CI: 20.8-45.2%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 36.1-53.0%), respectively. For patients aged over 65 yrs, prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 28.2% (95% CI: 23.5-33.1%), 25.2% (95% CI: 16.0-35.6%) and 48.4% (95% CI: 40.6-56.1%), respectively. For patients under 65 yrs, prevalence, incidence and mortality rates for delirium in COVID-19 patients were 15.7% (95% CI: 9.2-23.6%), 71.4% (95% CI: 58.5-82.7%) and 21.2% (95% CI: 15.4-27.6%), respectively. Overall, COVID-19 patients with delirium suffered higher risk of mortality, compared to those without delirium (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 2.1-4.8). CONCLUSION: Delirium developed in almost 1 out of 3 COVID-19 patients, and was associated with 3-fold overall mortality. Our findings suggest that first-line healthcare providers should systematically assess delirium and monitor related symptoms among COVID-19 patients.","Shao, Shih-Chieh; Lai, Chien-Cheng; Chen, Yi-Hung; Chen, Yung-Chang; Hung, Ming-Jui; Liao, Shu-Chen",Age ageing,,250
481944,Urban forests at the time of COVID-19 protect us from fine dust,2020,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? We sought to investigate whether carotid stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness and the aortic augmentation index are altered in young adults 3-4 weeks after contraction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared with young healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We found that carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and the aortic augmentation index were greater in young adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with healthy young adults. These findings provide additional evidence for detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 on young adult vasculature, which might have implications for cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT: Contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been observed to cause decrements in vascular function of young adults. However, less is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on arterial stiffness and structure, which might have additional implications for cardiovascular health. The purpose of this study was to assess the carotid artery stiffness and structure using ultrasound and the aortic augmentation index (AIx) using applanation tonometry in young adults after they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that carotid artery stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and aortic AIx would be elevated in young adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared with healthy young adults. We evaluated 15 young adults (six male and nine female; 20 ± 1 years of age; body mass index, 24 ± 3 kg m-2 ) 3-4 weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result compared with young healthy adults (five male and 10 female; 23 ± 1 years of age; body mass index, 22 ± 2 kg m-2 ) who were evaluated before the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and cIMT were assessed using ultrasound, whereas aortic AIx and aortic AIx standardized to 75 beats min-1 (AIx@HR75) were assessed from carotid pulse wave analysis using SphygmoCor. Group differences were observed for carotid stiffness (control, 5 ± 1 m s-1 ; SARS-CoV-2, 6 ± 1 m s-1 ), Young's modulus (control, 396 ± 120 kPa; SARS-CoV-2, 576 ± 224 kPa), aortic AIx (control, 3 ± 13%; SARS-CoV-2, 13 ± 9%) and aortic AIx@HR75 (control, -3 ± 16%; SARS-CoV-2, 10 ± 7%; P < 0.05). However, cIMT was similar between groups (control, 0.42 ± 0.06 mm; SARS-CoV-2, 0.44 ± 0.08 mm; P > 0.05). This cross-sectional analysis revealed higher carotid artery stiffness and aortic stiffness among young adults with SARS-CoV-2. These results provide further evidence of cardiovascular impairments among young adults recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be considered for cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2.","Szeghy, Rachel E; Province, Valesha M; Stute, Nina L; Augenreich, Marc A; Koontz, Laurel K; Stickford, Jonathon L; Stickford, Abigail S L; Ratchford, Stephen M",Exp. physiol,,250

The aim of the study was to examine the personal factors (body self-esteem and disinhibition) and erotic-sexual factors (sexual initiation strategies and erotic-pornographic sexting) that predict grooming. METHOD: The sample was comprised of 1,200 adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (M = 14.54, SD = 1.17; 50.83% girls). A cross-sectional design with self-report data was used and structural equation modeling (SEM) with mediation analysis was performed. RESULTS: The results indicated two paths explaining child grooming: 1) physical attractiveness and disinhibition are indirectly associated with grooming through erotic sexting and direct sexual initiation strategies; both of which partially mediate this relationship; 2) disinhibited behavior has an indirect impact on grooming; pornographic sexting and coercive strategies acting as mediators. The semi-partial mediation model explains 54% of the variance of grooming. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the urgent need to implement prevention programs considering these attitudes and behaviors that function as precursors of victimization and the risk of falling into pedophile networks","Schoeps, Konstanze; Peris Hernández, Montserrar; Garaigordobil, Maite; Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada",Psicothema (Oviedo),,250

The present research explored the relationship among the employees’ beliefs regarding self-confidence, grit, ease of use, self-efficacy, and usefulness of eLearning platforms in their workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 307 responses from Romanian employees who used eLearning platforms in corporate training (females = 60.3%, males = 39.7%, age range of less than 24 years (12.1%) to over 55 years (6.2%)) were exploited for research. Data were analyzed through a path analysis model. Results indicate that grit (i.e., consistency of interest), self-efficacy, and perceived ease of use of eLearning platforms were considerably directly influenced by the self-confidence variable. Usefulness was directly influenced by the ease of use and was indirectly influenced by self-confidence. Mediation analysis indicated that full mediation occurs only through the ease of use of eLearning platforms variable in the relationship between self-confidence and usefulness. A unit increase in self-confidence will increase the expected value of grit by 0.54 units (t = 8.39, p &lt;0.001), will indirectly increase the expected value of usefulness through ease of use by 0.15 units (t = 2.39, p = 0.017), and will increase the expected value of self-efficacy by 0.53 units (t = 6.26, p &lt;0.001). In addition, perceived ease of use of eLearning platforms in corporate training fully mediated the relationship of usefulness regressed on self-confidence (β = 0.20, t = 2.51, p = 0.012). These novel results reveal the contributions of self-confidence, consistency of interest as a grit dimension, and ease of use of eLearning platforms in predicting lifelong learning solutions, which improve business outcomes.

DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated to adults (n=8,425; 44.5±14.8y) residing in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia within the first 2-6 weeks of government-mandated COVID-19 restrictions. Main outcome measures included: Stages of Change scale for exercise behaviour change; International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short-form); World Health Organisation-5 Well-being Index; and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9. RESULTS: Participants who reported a negative change in exercise behaviour from before initial COVID-19 restrictions to during the initial COVID-19 restrictions demonstrated poorer mental health and well-being compared to those demonstrating either a positive-or no change in their exercise behaviour (p<0.001). Whilst women reported more positive changes in exercise behaviour, young people (18-29y) reported more negative changes (both p<0.001). Individuals who had more positive exercise behaviours reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). Although there were no differences in PA between countries, individuals in New Zealand reported better mental health and well-being (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The initial COVID-19 restrictions have differentially impacted upon PA habits of individuals based upon their age and sex, and therefore have important implications for international policy and guideline recommendations. Public health interventions that encourage PA should target specific groups (e.g., men, young adults) who are most vulnerable to the negative effects of physical distancing and/or self-isolation.","Faulkner, James; O039,; Brien, Wendy J; McGrane, Bronagh; Wadsworth, Daniel; Batten, John; Askew, Christopher D; Badenhorst, Claire; Byrd, Erin; Coulter, Maura; Draper, Nick; Elliot, Catherine; Fryer, Simon; Hamlin, Michael J; Jakeman, John; Mackintosh, Kelly A; McNarry, Melitta A; Mitchelmore, Andrew; Murphy, John; Ryan-Stewart, Helen; Saynor, Zoe; Schaumberg, Mia; Stone, Keeron; Stoner, Lee; Stuart, Beth; Lambrick, Danielle",J. sci. med. sport,,250

However, a thorough investigation of the interplay between infected cells and the immune system at sites of infection has been lacking. Here we use high-parameter imaging mass cytometry9 that targets the expression of 36 proteins to investigate the cellular composition and spatial architecture of acute lung injury in humans (including injuries derived from SARS-CoV-2 infection) at single-cell resolution. These spatially resolved single-cell data unravel the disordered structure of the infected and injured lung, alongside the distribution of extensive immune infiltration. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of bacterial pneumonia and COVID-19, respectively. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells and induces a localized hyperinflammatory cell state that is associated with lung damage. We leverage the temporal range of fatal outcomes of COVID-19 in relation to the onset of symptoms, which reveals increased macrophage extravasation and increased numbers of mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts concomitant with increased proximity between these cell types as the disease progresses-possibly as a result of attempts to repair the damaged lung tissue. Our data enable us to develop a biologically interpretable landscape of lung pathology from a structural, immunological and clinical standpoint. We use this landscape to characterize the pathophysiology of the human lung from its macroscopic presentation to the single-cell level, which provides an important basis for understanding COVID-19 and lung pathology in general.","Rendeiro, André F; Ravichandran, Hiranmayi; Bram, Yaron; Chandar, Vasuretha; Kim, Junbum; Meydan, Cem; Park, Jiwoon; Foox, Jonathan; Hether, Tyler; Warren, Sarah; Kim, Youngmi; Reeves, Jason; Salvatore, Steven; Mason, Christopher E; Swanson, Eric C; Borczuk, Alain C; Elemento, Olivier; Schwartz, Robert E",Nature,,250

In the multivariate Cox-regression of mortality predictors, anosmia (HR: 0.358, 95%CI: 0.140-0.916) and altered mental status (HR: 1.867, 95%CI: 1.162-3.001) were significant. CONCLUSION: Neurological symptoms were the most frequent extrapulmonary symptoms. They were present in half of the Covid-19 patients at the time of the ED visit. Anosmia on admission was an independent predictor of lower in-hospital mortality and altered mental status on admission predicted in-hospital mortality.","García-Azorín, David; Trigo, Javier; Martínez-Pías, Enrique; Hernández-Pérez, Isabel; Valle-Peñacoba, Gonzalo; Talavera, Blanca; Simón-Campo, Paula; de Lera, Mercedes; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; López-Sanz, Cristina; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, María; Martínez-Velasco, Elena; Pedraza, María; Sierra, Álvaro; Gómez-Vicente, Beatriz; Guerrero, Ángel; Arenillas, Juan Francisco",Brain Behav,,250
488628,Impact of Presymptomatic COVID-19 on Vascular and Skeletal Muscle Function: A Case Study,2021,"In response to physiological demand, the pituitary gland generates new hormone-secreting cells from committed progenitor cells throughout life. It remains unclear to what extent pituitary stem cells (PSCs), which uniquely express SOX2, contribute to pituitary growth and renewal. Moreover, neither the signals that drive proliferation nor their sources have been elucidated. We have used genetic approaches in the mouse, showing that the WNT pathway is essential for proliferation of all lineages in the gland. We reveal that SOX2+ stem cells are a key source of WNT ligands. By blocking secretion of WNTs from SOX2+ PSCs in vivo, we demonstrate that proliferation of neighbouring committed progenitor cells declines, demonstrating that progenitor multiplication depends on the paracrine WNT secretion from SOX2+ PSCs. Our results indicate that stem cells can hold additional roles in tissue expansion and homeostasis, acting as paracrine signalling centres to coordinate the proliferation of neighbouring cells.","Russell, John P; Lim, Xinhong; Santambrogio, Alice; Yianni, Val; Kemkem, Yasmine; Wang, Bruce; Fish, Matthew; Haston, Scott; Grabek, Anaëlle; Hallang, Shirleen; Lodge, Emily J; Patist, Amanda L; Schedl, Andreas; Mollard, Patrice; Nusse, Roel; Andoniadou, Cynthia L",eLife (Cambridge),,250
488703,Rapid Artificial Intelligence Solutions in a Pandemic - The COVID-19-20 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge,2021,"More than one billion students are out of school because of Covid-19, forced to a remote learning that has several drawbacks and has been hurriedly arranged; in addition, most countries are currently uncertain on how to plan school activities for the 2020-2021 school year; all of this makes learning and education some of the biggest world issues of the current pandemic. Unfortunately, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, full opening of schools seems to be impractical till a vaccine is available. In order to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we study a mathematical model of the diffusion of the epidemic due to school opening, and evaluate plans aimed at containing the extra Covid-19 cases due to school activities while ensuring an adequate number of in-class learning periods. We consider a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable loss function; after a realistic parameter selection, we numerically determine optimal school opening strategies by simulated annealing. It turns out that blended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remote teaching days or weeks, are generally optimal. Besides containing Covid-19 diffusion, these solutions could be pedagogically acceptable, and could also become a driving model for the society at large. In a prototypical example, the optimal strategy results in the school opening 90 days out of 200 with the number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing by about 66%, instead of the about 250% increase that would have been a consequence of full opening.","Gandolfi, Alberto",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03672v1.pdf,250

In Africa, with its hot climate, decision makers try to get people to their work as health care professionals or sometimes access health care facilities. For the peak four months; April, May, June, and July, the virus appeared, spread, and began to decrease. This study aims at analyzing the direct impact of Covid-19 in Africa according to the available data until July 2020. It provides statistics and policies prepared by African countries for this pandemic with the aid of other developed countries' experiences. From studying such applicable policies, it can be seen in a number of cases that lockdown restrictions, school and workplace closures, and limitations to the internal movement have the chief effect of reducing virus spread. Change in travel behavior and number of visitors appear in response to such a crisis. Regarding the potential economic repercussions in the studied period, GDP shows a sharp drop of 3.4%, appearing as a reduction of 6% on the price of oil, reducing the number of tourists by 46%, and causing fluctuations in currency. These suggest a mutual influence between the crisis and the transport sector.","Elbany, M; Elhenawy, Y",,,250

489680,COVID-19: guaranteed Loans and Zombie Firms,2020,"The presence of ammonia within the body has long been linked to complications stemming from the liver, kidneys, and stomach. These complications can be the result of serious conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), peptic ulcers, and recently COVID-19. Limited liver and kidney function leads to increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within the body resulting in elevated levels of ammonia in the mouth, nose, and skin. Similarly, peptic ulcers, commonly from H. pylori, result in ammonia production from urea within the stomach. The presence of these biomarkers enables a potential screening protocol to be considered for frequent, non-invasive monitoring of these conditions. Unfortunately, detection of ammonia in these mediums is rather challenging due to relatively small concentrations and an abundance of interferents. Currently, there are no options available for non-invasive screening of these conditions continuously and in real-time. Here we demonstrate the selective detection of ammonia using a vapor phase thermodynamic sensing platform capable of being employed as part of a health screening protocol. The results show that our detection system has the remarkable ability to selectively detect trace levels of ammonia in the vapor phase using a single catalyst. Additionally, detection was demonstrated in the presence of interferents such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetone common in human breath. These results show that our thermodynamic sensors are well suited to selectively detect ammonia at levels that could potentially be useful for health screening applications.","Ricci, Peter P; Gregory, Otto J",Sci Rep,,250

490017,Textbook Affordability in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"Monitoring social discourse about COVID-19 vaccines is key to understanding how large populations perceive vaccination campaigns. We focus on 4765 unique popular tweets in English or Italian about COVID-19 vaccines between 12/2020 and 03/2021. One popular English tweet was liked up to 495,000 times, stressing how popular tweets affected cognitively massive populations. We investigate both text and multimedia in tweets, building a knowledge graph of syntactic/semantic associations in messages including visual features and indicating how online users framed social discourse mostly around the logistics of vaccine distribution. The English semantic frame of""vaccine""was highly polarised between trust/anticipation (towards the vaccine as a scientific asset saving lives) and anger/sadness (mentioning critical issues with dose administering). Semantic associations with""vaccine,""""hoax""and conspiratorial jargon indicated the persistence of conspiracy theories and vaccines in massively read English posts (absent in Italian messages). The image analysis found that popular tweets with images of people wearing face masks used language lacking the trust and joy found in tweets showing people with no masks, indicating a negative affect attributed to face covering in social discourse. A behavioural analysis revealed a tendency for users to share content eliciting joy, sadness and disgust and to like less sad messages, highlighting an interplay between emotions and content diffusion beyond sentiment. With the AstraZeneca vaccine being suspended in mid March 2021,""Astrazeneca""was associated with trustful language driven by experts, but popular Italian tweets framed""vaccine""by crucially replacing earlier levels of trust with deep sadness.

The cardiovascular mechanisms of injury are poorly understood and speculative. We aim to use multimodality cardiac imaging including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) and positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) to identify the cardiac pathophysiological mechanisms related to COVID-19 infections. METHODS: This is a single-centre exploratory observational study aiming to recruit 50 patients with COVID-19 infection who will undergo cardiac biomarker sampling. Of these, 30 patients will undergo combined CTCA and 18F-FDG-PET/CT, followed by CMR. Prevalence of obstructive and non-obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease will be assessed using CTCA. CMR will be used to identify and characterise myocardial disease including presence of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, myocardial oedema and myocardial infarction. 18F-FDG-PET/CT will identify vascular and cardiac inflammation. Primary endpoint will be the presence of cardiovascular pathology and the association with troponin levels. DISCUSSION: The results of the study will identify the presence and modality of cardiac injury associated COVID-19 infection, and the utility of multi-modality imaging in diagnosing such injury. This will further inform clinical decision making during the pandemic.

490087,Manufacturing to Contract Because of COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. In Brazil, 110 thousand cases and 5,901 deaths were confirmed by the end of April 2020. The scarcity of laboratory resources, the overload on the service network, and the broad clinical spectrum of the disease make it difficult to document all the deaths due to COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality rate in Brazilian capitals with a high incidence of COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed the weekly mortality between epidemiological week 1 and 16 in 2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. We estimated the expected mortality at 95% confidence interval by projecting the mortality in 2019 to the population in 2020, using data from the National Association of Civil Registrars (ARPEN-Brasil). RESULTS: In the five capitals with the highest incidence of COVID-19, we identified excess deaths during the pandemic. The age group above 60 years was severely affected, while 31% of the excess deaths occurred in the age group of 20-59 years. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between excess deaths and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological monitoring. The epidemiological surveillance captured only 52% of all mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities examined. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the simplicity of the method and its low cost, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic should be used as a complementary tool for regular epidemiological surveillance.","Freitas, André Ricardo Ribas; Medeiros, Nicole Montenegro de; Frutuoso, Livia Carla Vinhal; Beckedorff, Otto Albuquerque; Martin, Lucas Mariscal Alves de; Coelho, Marcela Montenegro de Medeiros; Freitas, Giovanna Gimenez Souza de; Lemos, Daniele Rocha Queiróz; Cavalcanti, Luciano Pamplona de Góes",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,250

We consider a simple model in which agents without previous contact with the rumor, being skeptically oriented, may convince spreaders to stop their activity or, once exposed to the rumor, decide not to propagate it as a consequence, for example, of fact-checking. We extend a previous, mean-field analysis of the combined effect of these two mechanisms, active and passive skepticism, to include spatial correlations. This can be done either analytically, through the pair approximation, or simulating an agent-based version on diverse networks. Our results show that while in mean-field there is no coexistence between spreaders and susceptibles (although, depending on the parameters, there may be bistability depending on the initial conditions), when spatial correlations are included, because of the protective effect of the isolation provided by removed agents, coexistence is possible.","Amaral, Marco Antonio; Dantas, W.

491959,From Testing to Decision-Making: A Data-Driven Analytics COVID-19 Response,2021,"BACKGROUND: Dementia was identified as a priority area for the development of a Clinical Quality Registry (CQR) in Australia in 2016. The Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) Registry is being established as part of the ADNeT initiative, with the primary objective of collecting data to monitor and enhance the quality of care and patient outcomes for people diagnosed with either dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A secondary aim is to facilitate the recruitment of participants into dementia research and trials. This paper describes the Registry protocol. METHODS: The ADNeT Registry is a prospective CQR of patients newly diagnosed with either dementia or MCI. Eligible patients will be identified initially from memory clinics and individual medical specialists (e.g., geriatricians, psychiatrists and neurologists) involved in the diagnosis of dementia. Participants will be recruited using either an opt-out approach or waiver of consent based on three key determinants (capacity, person responsible, and communication of diagnosis). Data will be collected from four sources: participating sites, registry participants, carers, and linkage with administrative datasets. It is anticipated that the Registry will recruit approximately 10,000 participants by the end of 2023. The ADNeT registry will be developed and implemented to comply with the national operating principles for CQRs and governed by the ADNeT Registry Steering Committee. DISCUSSION: The ADNeT Registry will provide important data on current clinical practice in the diagnosis, treatment and care of people with dementia and MCI in Australia as well as long-term outcomes among these people. These data will help to identify variations in clinical practice and patient outcomes and reasons underlying these variations, which in turn, will inform the development of interventions to improve care and outcomes for people with dementia and MCI.","Lin, Xiaoping; Wallis, Kasey; Ward, Stephanie A; Brodaty, Henry; Sachdev, Perminder S; Naismith, Sharon L; Krysinska, Karolina; McNeil, John; Rowe, Christopher C; Ahern, Susannah",BMC Geriatr,,250

We sought to determine whether infliximab-treated patients with IBD have attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. DESIGN: Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared with a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin &#945;4ß7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between 22 September and 23 December 2020. RESULTS: Rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% (161/4685) vs 6.0% (134/2250), p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.87), p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92), p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity. In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% (39/81) vs 83% (30/36), p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut-off index (0.2-5.6) vs 37.0 (15.2-76.1), p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is associated with attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 that were further blunted by immunomodulators used as concomitant therapy. Impaired serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection might have important implications for global public health policy and individual anti-TNF-treated patients. Serological testing and virus surveillance should be considered to detect suboptimal vaccine responses, persistent infection and viral evolution to inform public health policy.

Given concerns for rapidly rising infection rates in the US, impending staffing shortages, and potential for resource re-allocation, we rapidly re-evaluated our rectal cancer practice polices during this public health emergency. Previous to the pandemic we commonly utilized total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with a strong preference for long course chemoradiation (LCCRT). In the setting of the ongoing pandemic we now mandate short course radiation therapy (SCRT). Despite multiple randomized trials demonstrating no difference in locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or overall survival between SCRT and LRCCT, adaptation of SCRT in the United States has been low given concerns for less tumor downstaging and increased toxicity. In the setting of the ongoing and likely prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, we feel that these concerns must be re-evaluated, as SCRT presents a well-validated alternative that will allow us to meet the needs of a greater number of potentially curable patients, at a time when our resources are severely and acutely constrained.","Romesser, Paul B; Wu, Abraham J; Cercek, Andrea; Smith, J Joshua; Weiser, Martin; Saltz, Leonard; Garcia-Aguilar, Julio; Crane, Christopher H",,,250

In this work, motivated by the enormous advantages of Zn-based metal-organic framework-derived nanocarbons, C-ZnO nanocarbons-modified fibrous scaffolds for stem cell-based osteogenic differentiation are constructed. The modified scaffolds show enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, vinculin, and a larger cell spreading area. Meanwhile, the caging of ZnO nanoparticles can allow the slow release of Zn2+ ions, which not only activate various signaling pathways to guide osteogenic differentiation but also prevent the potential bacterial infection of implantable scaffolds. Overall, this study may provide new insight for designing stem cell-based nanostructured fibrous scaffolds with simultaneously enhanced osteogenic and anti-infective capabilities.","Xia, Yi; Fan, Xin; Yang, Hua; Li, Ling; He, Chao; Cheng, Chong; Haag, Rainer",Small,,250

FINDINGS: The 10 most frequently documented nursing interventions across in-patient (ward) and intensive care unit (ICU) contexts included Admission Care (7310), Environmental Management (6486), Health Education (5510), Infection Protection (6550), Medication Administration (2300), Positioning (0840), Respiratory Monitoring (3350), Vital Signs Monitoring (6680), Nausea Management (1450), and Diarrhea Management (0460). No records of distraction, relaxation techniques, or massage for anxiety reduction were documented. CONCLUSION: This study used a common language to describe nursing interventions for patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary hospital. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: The most commonly identified nursing interventions for COVID-19 identified in this study provide evidence-based insight into nurses' scope of practice in the COVID-19 in-patient context.","Asghari, Elnaz; Archibald, Mandy; Roshangar, Fariborz",International journal of nursing knowledge (Online),,250

494860,Covid-19: An efficient and effective test trace regime is not a numbers game,2020,"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies described the epidemiological link and main clinical features of pediatric COVID-19, during the first pandemic period. Our study encompasses several different phases since the National Lockdown in Italy. The primary outcome is (I) to analyze the prevalence of positive NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) among the largest Italian Pediatric cohort admitted to a single regional PED Hub for COVID-19 during an eight-month period. Secondary outcomes are: (II) the description of trend of admissions in our PED and (III) the categorization of the positive patients according to clinical manifestations and epidemiological link. METHODS: We described 316 patients with a positive NST for SARS-CoV2, on a total of 5001 nasopharyngeal swabs performed among 13,171 admissions at our PED, over a period starting from March 17th, 2020 to December 1st, 2020. Age, epidemiological link, clinical features and hospitalizations were analyzed according to different lockdown phases. Data were collected anonymously from electronic records and analyzed using SPSS 22.00 statistics software (Chicago, IL). RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of total admissions have been tested. During the post lockdown period, we performed the highest percentage of NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) 49.7%, and among them 7.9% were positive. The prevalence of infection during a 10-month period was 2.3%. Mean age was 6.5 years old. Familial Link accounted for the 67.7% of infection, while Extrafamilial and Unknown link accounted for 17 and 14.9%, respectively. Familial link is predominant during all phases. Seventeen patients showed an intra-scholastic link, and the highest prevalence was observed in the 7-10 years age group, with a prevalence of 12.8% (5 patients). Fever was the most frequent symptom (66%), in particular among preschooler children aged 0-6 years (71.9%). Older children were more frequently symptomatic. Seven patients were admitted with MIS-C diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Different levels of containment measures caused important changes in number of positive NST for SARS-CoV2. Familial link was predominant in our cohort, during all phases of Lockdown. The risk of being infected at home is four time greater than the risk of being infected from an extra familial individual. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clear impact of intra-scholastic link. The constant improvement in knowledge on onset symptoms and risk factor for SARS-CoV2 infection and its complications (e.g. MIS-C), can impact on number of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and early management.","Crea, Francesca; Panfili, Filippo Maria; Amodeo, Maria Elisa; Fintini, Danilo; Rossi, Francesco Paolo; Trenta, Italo; Menichella, Alessandra; Ossella, Chiara; Deidda, Andrea; Lidano, Roberta; Macchiarulo, Giulia; Lambiase, Caterina; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Raponi, Massimiliano",Ital J Pediatr,,250

DESIGN: Ecological analysis of COVID-19-related mortality rates occurring by 24 April 2020 and ethnic composition of the population. Account is taken of age, population density, area deprivation and pollution. SETTING: Local authorities in England. RESULTS: For every 1% rise in proportion of the population who are ethnic minority, COVID-19-related deaths increased by 5·12, 95% CI (4·00 to 6·24), per million. This rise is present for each ethnic minority category examined, including the white minority group. The size of this increase is a little reduced in an adjusted model to 4·42, 95% CI (2·24 to 6·60), suggesting that some of the association results from ethnic minority people living in more densely populated, more polluted and more deprived areas.This estimate suggests that the average England COVID-19-related death rate would rise by 25% in a local authority with two times the average number of ethnic minority people. CONCLUSIONS: We find clear evidence that rates of COVID-19-related mortality within a local authority increases as the proportion of the population who are ethnic minority increases. We suggest that this is a consequence of social and economic inequalities driven by entrenched structural and institutional racism and racial discrimination. We argue that these factors should be central to any investigation of ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Nazroo, James; Becares, Laia",BMJ Open,,250

Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a system that combined telehealth applications with local psychosocial support teams. Materials and Methods: A mobile application-based approach supported by the conventional local units was used. A three-step approach including contacting live operators followed by video calls from psychiatrists or child and adolescent psychiatrists and if necessary local unit support was used to provide support. Results: In addition to system records covering sociodemographic variables and initial complaints, a telephone survey, questioning the effectiveness and satisfaction of the system, was used as the main outcome. The number of individuals who asked for a psychiatrist appointment from operators after downloading the application was 1,076 (n = 879 [81.6%] support for self) (n = 197 [18.4%] support for child). Four hundred forty-nine (n = 449) HCWs (41.7%) replied video calls and received psychiatric help from psychiatrists on the time of appointment (n = 351 [78.1%] support for self) (n = 98 [21.8%] support for child). The overall satisfaction level of HCWs for the service they received was 8.1/10 (8.1/10 for support for self, 8.4/10 for support for the child. 86.6% (n = 389). Discussion: The findings of this study suggest that although telepsychiatry may be useful in public health emergencies such as COVID-19 pandemics should not be consisted of only telephone lines or video calls. Conclusions: Systems combining telehealth applications and local intervention teams may be more effective and establishing such organizations is possible in short intervals.","Dursun, Onur Burak; Turan, Bahadir; Pakyürek, Murat; Tekin, Ahmet",Telemed. j. e. health,,250
496045,How Medical Studies in Poland Prepare Future Healthcare Managers for Crises and Disasters: Results of a Pilot Study,2020,"The transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can occur through an airborne route, in addition to contaminated surfaces and objects. In hospitals, it has been confirmed by several studies that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate surfaces and medical equipment especially in hospitals dedicated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The aim of this study was to detect the contamination of hands, objects, and surfaces in isolation rooms and also in outpatients' clinics in hospitals and polyclinics. Environmental contamination of public high-touch surfaces in public facilities was also investigated during an active COVID-19 pandemic. Random swabs were also taken from public shops, pharmacies, bakeries, groceries, banknotes, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 positivity using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the COVID-19 regional reference hospital, only 3 out of 20 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Hand swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in isolation rooms were occasionally positive for viral RNA. In outpatients' clinics, door handles were the most contaminated surfaces. Dental chairs, sinks, keyboards, ophthalmoscopes, and laboratory equipment were also contaminated. Although no positive swabs were found in shops and public facilities, random ATM swabs returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Although there is no longer a focus on COVID-19 wards and isolation hospitals, more attention is required to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces in health-care facilities used by patients not diagnosed with COVID-19. Additionally, high-touch public surfaces such as ATMs require further disinfection procedures to limit the transmission of the infection.","Elbadawy, Hossein M; Khattab, Amin; Alalawi, Ali; Dakilallah Aljohani, Fahad; Sundogji, Hamza; Mahmoud, Ameira S; Abouzied, Meky; Eltahir, Heba M; Alahmadey, Ziab; Bahashwan, Saleh; Suliman, Bandar A",J Med Virol,,250
496481,Authors' response re: Strategies to develop student support mechanisms in medical radiation sciences clinical education,2020,"BACKGROUND: Due to pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulation states, COVID-19 infection is believed to increase the risk of stroke and worsen the outcomes of the patients having pre-existing cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD). There is limited literature on prevalence of pre-existing CeVD in COVID-19 patients, and outcomes are unknown. The objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CeVD. METHODS: English full-text-observational studies having data on epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using MeSH-terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. Studies having CeVD or stroke as one of the pre-existing comorbidities and described outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation utilization, and mortality were selected with consensus of three reviewers. Following MOOSE protocol, 11 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of CeVD and outcomes were calculated. Meta-regression was performed, and correlation coefficient (r) and odds ratio (OR) were estimated to evaluate the effects of pre-existing CeVD on outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Meta-analysis with random-effects model was used to calculate OR along with its 95% CI from the studies containing data on composite poor outcome. RESULTS: Out of 8/11 studies showing data on mortality and mechanical ventilation, and 7/11 on ICU admission, pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.4% (244/4987). In age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, pre-existing CeVD was associated with ICU admission [r: 0.60; OR: 1.82 (1.25-2.69)], mechanical ventilation [r: 0.29; OR: 1.33 (1.09-1.63)], and mortality [r: 0.35; OR: 1.42 (1.14-1.77)] amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations. 9/11 studies reported data on binary composite outcomes, the pooled prevalence of pre-existing CeVD was 4.3% (155/3603) and 7.46% (83/1113) amongst COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 hospitalization-related poor outcomes, respectively. In meta-analysis, COVID-19 patient with pre-existing CeVD had 2.67-fold (1.75-4.06) higher odds of poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease have poor outcomes and extra precautions should be taken in managing such patients during the ongoing pandemic.","Patel, Urvish; Malik, Preeti; Shah, Dhaivat; Patel, Achint; Dhamoon, Mandip; Jani, Vishal",J. neurol,,250

496696,Analysis of COVID-19 Mathematical and Software Models: Or How NOT to Set Up a Softward Project,2020,"Objectives: Europe is a destination for many migrants, a group whose proportion of the overall population will increase over the next decades. The cardiovascular (CV) risk distribution and outcomes, as well as health literacy, are likely to differ from the host population. Challenges related to migrant health status, cardiovascular risk distribution and health literacy are compounded by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) crisis. Methods: We performed a narrative review of available evidence on migrant CV and health literacy in Europe. Results: Health literacy is lower in migrants but can be improved through targeted interventions. In some subgroups of migrants, rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, most importantly hypertension and diabetes, are higher. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for a so-called healthy migrant effect, describing lower rates of CV risk distribution and mortality in a different subset of migrants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CV risk factors, as well as health literacy, are key elements in optimally managing public health responses in the ongoing pandemic. Conclusions: Migrants are both an opportunity and a challenge for public health in Europe. Research aimed at better understanding the healthy migrant effect is necessary. Implementing the beneficial behaviors of migrants could improve outcomes in the whole population. Specific interventions to screen for risk factors, manage chronic disease and increase health literacy could improve health care for migrants. This pandemic is a challenge for the whole population, but active inclusion of immigrants in established health care systems could help improve the long-term health outcomes of migrants in Europe.","Wernly, Bernhard; Wernly, Sarah; Magnano, Anthony; Paul, Elizabeth",Z Gesundh Wiss,,250

Cross-sectoral communication is pivotal. Involvement of patients may add to intended mechanisms.A randomised controlled trial 'The Partnership Study' tested the effect of bringing together patient, general practitioner (GP) and oncologist for a consultation conducted by video. PURPOSE: As part of the process evaluation, this study aimed to explore experiences, attitudes and perspectives of the oncological department on sharing patient consultations with GPs using video. METHODS: Four semistructured interviews with five oncologists and four nurse specialists were conducted in February 2020. We focused on the informants' experiences and reflections on the potential of future implementation of the concept 'inviting the GP for a shared consultation by video'. The analyses were based on an inductive, open-minded, hermeneutic phenomenological approach. RESULTS: A total of six overall themes were identified: structuring consultation and communication, perceptions of GP involvement in cancer care, stressors, making a difference, alternative ways of cross-sector communication and needs for redesigning the model. The concept made sense and was deemed useful, but solving the many technical and organisational problems is pivotal. Case-specific tasks and relational issues were targeted by pragmatically rethinking protocol expectations and the usual way of communication and structuring patient encounters. Case selection was discussed as one way of maturing the concept. CONCLUSION: This Danish study adds new insight into understanding different aspects of the process, causal mechanisms as well as the potential of future implementation of video-based tripartite encounters. Beyond solving the technical problems, case selection and organisational issues are important. Acknowledging the disruption of the usual workflow, the introduction of new phases of the usual encounter and the variety of patient-GP relationships to be embraced may help to better understand and comply with barriers and facilitators of communication and sharing.

Further, we tested whether the perceived impact of the pandemic mediated the association between having had a psychiatric diagnosis and suicide ideation. METHODS: Asample of 227 Portuguese community adults (183 women, 44 men) participated online. RESULTS: Low education, having had a psychiatric diagnosis, and the perceived psychological impact of the pandemic each related to the presence of suicide ideation. Perceived psychological impact partially mediated the association between having had a psychiatric diagnosis and suicide ideation, as indexed by the total score on the Suicide Ideation Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis, with a lower education level, and with a perceived psychological impact of the pandemic are at greater risk for experiencing suicide ideation, and psychological impact appears to be stronger for persons with a psychiatric diagnosis and, thus, resulting in more suicide ideation.

There is a critical need to better understand the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 that lead to either resolution or exacerbation of the clinical disease. Here, we examine longitudinal plasma samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients with differential clinical outcome. We perform immune-repertoire analysis including cytokine, hACE2-receptor inhibition, neutralization titers, antibody epitope repertoire, antibody kinetics, antibody isotype and antibody affinity maturation against the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike protein. Fatal cases demonstrate high plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF&#945;, and MCP-1, and sustained high percentage of IgA-binding antibodies to prefusion spike compared with non-ICU survivors. Disease resolution in non-ICU and ICU patients associates with antibody binding to the receptor binding motif and fusion peptide, and antibody affinity maturation to SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike protein. Here, we provide insight into the immune parameters associated with clinical disease severity and disease-resolution outcome in hospitalized patients that could inform development of vaccine/therapeutics against COVID-19.","Tang, Juanjie; Ravichandran, Supriya; Lee, Youri; Grubbs, Gabrielle; Coyle, Elizabeth M; Klenow, Laura; Genser, Hollie; Golding, Hana; Khurana, Surender",Nat Commun,,250

To perform the field assessment, a checklist developed by the CDC (Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Tool for Nursing Homes Preparing for COVID-19) and adapted to the Italian context was used. Fourteen facilities took part in the survey (87.5%). The application of good practices for each survey area was expressed as a percentage with the following median values: restriction policies (87.5%), staff training (53.8%), resident training (67.6%), availability of personal protective equipment (41.7%), infection control practices (73.5%) and communication (80%). Among the facilities, considerable variability was observed in these evaluation fields: only the restriction policies and communication activities were applied uniformly.

500365,Ethical decision-making for children with neuromuscular disorders in the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the initial COVID-19 pandemic, young United Kingdom (UK) kidney patients underwent lockdown and those with increased vulnerabilities socially isolated or 'shielded' at home. The experiences, information needs, decision-making and support needs of children and young adult (CYA) patients or their parents during this period is not well known. METHODS: A UK-wide online survey co-produced with patients was conducted in May 2020 amongst CYA aged 12-30, or parents of children aged < 18 years with any long-term kidney condition. Participants answered qualitative open text alongside quantitative closed questions. Thematic content analysis using a three-stage coding process was conducted. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighteen CYA (median age 21) and 197 parents of children (median age 10) responded. Predominant concerns from CYA were heightened vigilance about viral (68%) and kidney symptoms (77%) and detrimental impact on education or work opportunities (70%). Parents feared the virus more than CYA (71% vs. 40%), and had concerns that their child would catch the virus from them (64%) and would have an adverse impact on other children at home (65%). CYA thematic analysis revealed strong belief of becoming seriously ill if they contracted COVID-19; lost educational opportunities, socialisation and career development; and frustration with the public for not following social distancing rules. Positive outcomes included improved family relationships and community cohesion. Only a minority (14-21% CYA and 20-31% parents, merged questions) desired more support. Subgroup analysis identified greater negative psychological impact in the shielded group. CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrates substantial concern and need for accurate tailored advice for CYA based on individualised risks to improve shared decision making.","Tse, Yincent; Darlington, Anne-Sophie E; Tyerman, Kay; Wallace, Dean; Pankhurst, Tanya; Chantziara, Sofia; Culliford, David; Recio-Saucedo, Alejandra; Nagra, Arvind",Pediatr. nephrol,,250

Social distancing policies rose to prominence as most capable of containing contagion and saving lives. Our purpose in this paper is to identify the causal effect of social distancing policies on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and on contagion velocity. We align our main argument with the existing scientific consensus: social distancing policies negatively affect the number of cases. To test this hypothesis, we construct a dataset with daily information on 78 affected countries in the world. We compute several relevant measures from publicly available information on the number of cases and deaths to estimate causal effects for short-term and cumulative effects of social distancing policies. We use a time-series cross-sectional matching approach to match countries' observable histories. Causal effects (ATTs and ATEs) can be extracted via a dif-in-dif estimator. Results show that social distancing policies reduce the aggregated number of cases by 4,832 on average (or 17.5/100 thousand), but only when strict measures are adopted. This effect seems to manifest from the third week onwards.","Cunha, Matheus; Domingos, Amanda; Rocha, Virginia; Torres, Marcus",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,250

The country's Jewish community, constituting 0.1% of the population with a median age of 45 years, has not escaped its effects. Organizations and individuals have nonetheless been able to mobilize a rapid and wide-reaching series of responses directed towards those most in need both inside and outside the community. The uniquely coordinated, energetic, and multipronged nature of these responses are attributed to robust communal infrastructure, strong community social capital, and the history of the Jewish community's positioning in post-apartheid South Africa, alongside the perceived importance of health to collective well-being.","Gilbert, Shirli; Gilbert, Leah",Contemp Jew,,250
503612,"Residency match trends, racial disparity, and matching amidst a pandemic",2020,"The recent pandemic triggered by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus boosted the demand for medical services and protective equipment, causing the generation rate of infectious medical waste (IMW) to increase rapidly. Designing an efficient and reliable IMW reverse logistics network in this situation can help to control the spread of the virus. Studies on this issue are limited, and minimization of costs and the risks associated with the operations of this network consisting of different types of medical waste generation centers (MWGC) are rarely considered. In this research, a linear programming model with three objective functions is developed to minimize the total costs, the risk associated with the transportation and treatment of IMW, and the maximum amount of uncollected waste in MWGCs. Also, multiple functions that calculate the amount of generated waste according to the parameters of the current epidemic outbreak are proposed. Revised Multi-Choice Goal Programming method is employed to solve the multi-objective model, and a real case study from Iran is examined to illustrate the validation of the proposed model. The final results show that the model can create a balance between three considered objectives by determining the flow between centers, deciding to install two new temporary treatment centers, and allowing the network to only have uncollected waste in the first two periods in some MWGCs. Also, managerial insights for health organization authorities extracted from the final results and sensitivity analyses are presented for adequately handling the IMW network.","Kargar, Saeed; Pourmehdi, Mohammad; Paydar, Mohammad Mahdi",Sci Total Environ,,250

503905,Phase wise spatial and temporal variations of nitrogen dioxide during and pre COVID-19 lockdown period in tier-1 cities of India,2021,"BACKGROUND: Internet- and mobile-based interventions are most efficacious in the treatment of depression when they involve some form of guidance, but providing guidance requires resources such as trained personnel, who might not always be available (eg, during lockdowns to contain the COVID-19 pandemic). OBJECTIVE: The current analysis focuses on changes in symptoms of depression in a guided sample of patients with depression who registered for an internet-based intervention, the iFightDepression tool, as well as the extent of intervention use, compared to an unguided sample. The objective is to further understand the effects of guidance and adherence on the intervention's potential to induce symptom change. METHODS: Log data from two convenience samples in German routine care were used to assess symptom change after 6-9 weeks of intervention as well as minimal dose (finishing at least two workshops). A linear regression model with changes in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score as a dependent variable and guidance and minimal dose as well as their interaction as independent variables was specified. RESULTS: Data from 1423 people with symptoms of depression (n=940 unguided, 66.1%) were included in the current analysis. In the linear regression model predicting symptom change, a significant interaction of guidance and minimal dose revealed a specifically greater improvement for patients who received guidance and also worked with the intervention content (ß=-1.75, t=-2.37, P=.02), while there was little difference in symptom change due to guidance in the group that did not use the intervention. In this model, the main effect of guidance was only marginally significant (ß=-.53, t=-1.78, P=.08). CONCLUSIONS: Guidance in internet-based interventions for depression is not only an important factor to facilitate adherence, but also seems to further improve results for patients adhering to the intervention compared to those who do the same but without guidance.","Oehler, Caroline; Scholze, Katharina; Reich, Hanna; Sander, Christian; Hegerl, Ulrich",JMIR Ment Health,,250

It has caused huge medical challenges to Hubei Province with currently more than 67 thousand confirmed cases till March 08, 2020. Identification, there is no clinically effective drug. Isolation and masks are essential to limit human-to-human transmission initially. The nucleic acid test (NAT) of COVID-19 currently was the most reliable established laboratory diagnosis method in clinical. METHODS: From February 8th, 2020 to March 7th, 2020, 4254 cases were collected for analysis at six nucleic acid collection sites in the community medical team of Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which cover almost all groups who need NAT in Wuhan. Distribution of positive rates in different sites by genders, ages or occupations were compared. RESULTS: The positive rates of different sites from high to low were: hospital wards (24.71%) > fever clinics (16.57%) > nursing homes (5.51%) > isolation hotels (5.30%) > rehabilitation stations (1.36%) > close contact sites (0.17%). The confirmed patients in isolation hotels, hospital ward and fever clinical were mainly middle-aged and elderly, and most of them were women. The positive rate in isolation hotels and fever clinics gradually decreased over time. There were no significant differences between genders among those six nucleic acid collection sites (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The hospital wards have the highest positive rate; however, close contact sites have lowest one. Patients who are discharged from hospitals may still have potential risks. Middle-aged and older people remain the focus of epidemic prevention and control. This article is protected by copyright.

To further understand differing COVID-19 manifestations in patients of different ages, three age groups of ferrets were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from all ferrets regardless of age, aged ferrets (&gt;= 3 years old) showed higher viral loads, longer nasal virus shedding, and more severe lung inflammatory cell infiltration and clinical symptoms compared to juvenile (&lt;= 6 months) and young adult (1-2 years) groups. Transcriptome analysis of aged ferret lungs revealed strong enrichment of gene sets related to type I interferon, activated T cells, and M1 macrophage responses, mimicking the gene expression profile of severe COVID-19 patients. Thus, SARS-CoV-2-infected aged ferrets highly recapitulate COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and are useful for understanding age-associated infection, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Kim, Y.

Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a state-of-the-art technique to predict vaccine candidates from pathogen's genome(s). To promote vaccine development, we updated Vaxign2, the first web-based vaccine design program using reverse vaccinology with machine learning. Vaxign2 is a comprehensive web server for rational vaccine design, consisting of predictive and computational workflow components. The predictive part includes the original Vaxign filtering-based method and a new machine learning-based method, Vaxign-ML. The benchmarking results using a validation dataset showed that Vaxign-ML had superior prediction performance compared to other RV tools. Besides the prediction component, Vaxign2 implemented various post-prediction analyses to significantly enhance users' capability to refine the prediction results based on different vaccine design rationales and considerably reduce user time to analyze the Vaxign/Vaxign-ML prediction results. Users provide proteome sequences as input data, select candidates based on Vaxign outputs and Vaxign-ML scores, and perform post-prediction analysis. Vaxign2 also includes precomputed results from approximately 1 million proteins in 398 proteomes of 36 pathogens. As a demonstration, Vaxign2 was used to effectively analyse SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19. The comprehensive framework of Vaxign2 can support better and more rational vaccine design.

507151,Philosopher in Italian coronavirus lockdown on how to think positively about isolation,2020,"Background: In view of the growth of published papers, there is an increasing need for studies that summarise scientific research. An increasingly common review is a 'Methodology scoping review', which provides a summary of existing analytical methods, techniques and software, proposed or applied in research articles, which address an analytical problem or further an analytical approach. However, guidelines for their design, implementation and reporting are limited. Methods: Drawing on the experiences of the authors, which were consolidated through a series of face-to-face workshops, we summarise the challenges inherent in conducting a methodology scoping review and offer suggestions of best practice to promote future guideline development. Results: We identified three challenges of conducting a methodology scoping review. First, identification of search terms; one cannot usually define the search terms a priori and the language used for a particular method can vary across the literature. Second, the scope of the review requires careful consideration since new methodology is often not described (in full) within abstracts. Third, many new methods are motivated by a specific clinical question, where the methodology may only be documented in supplementary materials. We formulated several recommendations that build upon existing review guidelines. These recommendations ranged from an iterative approach to defining search terms through to screening and data extraction processes. Conclusion: Although methodology scoping reviews are an important aspect of research, there is currently a lack of guidelines to standardise their design, implementation and reporting. We recommend a wider discussion on this topic.","Martin, Glen P.; Jenkins, David; Bull, Lucy; Sisk, Rose; Lin, Lijing; Hulme, William; Wilson, Anthony; Wang, Wenjuan; Barrowman, Michael; Sammut-Powell, Camilla; Pate, Alexander; Sperrin, Matthew; Peek, Niels",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08988v1.pdf,250

WEIGHING OF RISKS IS NECESSARY IN POLICY DEVELOPMENT: Such policies are risky as was shown in the early response to the HIV pandemic where efforts to prevent mother to child transmission by replacing breastfeeding with infant formula feeding ultimately resulted in more infant deaths. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of maternal SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be weighed against the protection skin-to-skin contact, maternal proximity, and breastfeeding affords infants. CONCLUSION: Policy makers and practitioners need to learn from the mistakes of the HIV pandemic and not undermine breastfeeding in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear that in order to maximise infant health and wellbeing, COVID-19 policies should support skin-to-skin contact, maternal proximity, and breastfeeding.","Gribble, Karleen; Mathisen, Roger; Ververs, Mija-Tesse; Coutsoudis, Anna",Int Breastfeed J,,250

Many healthcare workers are involved in managing both COVID-suspected and confirmed cases. It is mandatory for healthcare workers to have droplet and contact precautions by means of Personal protective equipment (PPE), facemask, face shield or eye protection. Prolonged usage of medical mask results in various adverse effects. This study is an attempt to know the common effects of prolonged face mask in healthcare workers and its resultant quality-of-life (QOL). To study the common effects of prolonged face mask and its impact on QOL of healthcare workers during the COVID 19 crisis. This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted over 6 months among 2750 healthcare workers. A questionnaire requesting demographic details and most common side effects after prolonged usage of face mask was circulated. We also attached a short form-12 (sf-12) questionnaire to assess its impact on QOL. Out of 2750 personnel, 299 were excluded. Male preponderance was noted. Study was conducted on candidates using 3ply mask or above. Age range was between 18 and 65 years with mean age being 37.61 ± 15.23 in mask users < 5 h per day, 32.2 ± 10.02 in 5-10 h group and 30.19 ± 8.15 in 10 h group. 8.48% (n = 174) had comorbidities. QOL impacted. The complaints with face mask use definitely are troublesome with increase in severity with duration of mask usage. This definitely has a proportional impact on the healthcare workers' QOL.","Radhakrishnan, Nandhini; Sudarsan, Shyam Sudhakar; Deepak Raj, K; Krishnamoorthy, Srinivasan",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,250

509275,Australian College of Nurse Practitioners and COVID-19,2020,"Arcobacter species are Gram-negative rods that have been implicated in food- and waterborne illness. Although various cultural isolation methods have been proposed, the current procedures are unable to fully suppress growth of background microbiota present in food samples which inhibits Arcobacter isolation. The purpose of this study was to develop a selective enrichment broth and chromogenic plating medium to detect three Arcobacter species that have been recognized as emerging foodborne pathogens: Arcobacter butzleri , Arcobacter cryaerophilus and Arcobacter skirrowii . The developed Nguyen-Restaino-Juárez Arcobacter detection system consists of a selective enrichment broth (NRJ-B) and a selective/differential plating media (NRJ-M). The protocol of the detection method was determined by evaluating growth of A. butzleri , A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii under various temperature (30, 35 and 42á´¼C) and incubation (aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic) conditions. Additionally, 47 Arcobacter strains and 39 non- Arcobacter strains were tested in the inclusivity and exclusivity evaluations of NRJ-B and NRJ-M. Overall, the study determined the optimal growth conditions of Arcobacter species using the NRJ- Arcobacter detection system was aerobic incubation at 30á´¼C. NRJ-B supported good growth of A. butzleri , A. cryaerophilus , and A. skirrowii while effectively suppressing growth of non- Arcobacter strains after 48 h. Furthermore, NRJ-M yielded 97.8% inclusivity and 100.0% exclusivity using the tested strains and resulted in salmon-pigmented Arcobacter colonies (1.0 to 1.5 mm in diameter) after 72 h. The novel protocol is the first to develop a chromogenic plating media for the isolation of Arcobacter species. This simple and reliable test method would greatly contribute to understanding the distribution of pathogenic Arcobacter species in food samples.","Nguyen, Paul; Juárez, Oscar; Restaino, Lawrence",J. foof prot,,250

510689,Expressive Interviewing: A Conversational System for Coping with COVID-19,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND: The global status of the COVID-19 pandemic is not optimistic. This is a particularly vulnerable time for patients with pre-existing headache disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache patients in China. METHODS: A survey was conducted through an online survey platform on June 6, 2020. Demographic characteristics, the PHQ-9, the ISI, a COVID-19 questionnaire and a headache profile survey were included in the online questionnaire. RESULTS: Eventually, a total of 15,000 participants from China completed the online questionnaire. Among them, 2806 participants had pre-existing headache disorders. Our analysis showed reductions in the duration of headaches (3.414 ± 6.859 vs 4.033 ± 7.325 h, P<0.001), number of headache days per month (1.788 ± 2.989 vs 2.092 ± 3.694, P<0.001), and headache intensity (4.110 ± 1.609 vs 4.290 ± 1.680, P<0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Smoking (OR = 1.397, 95% CI 1.090 to 1.790, P = 0.008) and getting support from family members during social isolation (OR = 1.656, 95% CI 1.075 to 2.550, P = 0.022) were independent factors affecting the reduction in the duration of headaches. Education level (OR = 1.478, 95% CI 1.103 to 1.980, P = 0.009) and having a relative or acquaintance who contracted COVID-19 (OR = 0.643, 95% CI 0.458 to 0.902, P = 0.011) were the independent factors affecting the reduction in headache severity. Living in the Wuhan area, having symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 and having relatives or acquaintances who had contracted COVID-19 were associated with the worsening of headaches. CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced an overall trend towards the improvement of headaches during the COVID-19 pandemic. Family support might play an important role in the improvement of headaches.","Gong, Qiaoyu; Liu, Shuping; Li, Ruiting; Yao, Lihua; Xiao, Zheman",BMC Neurol,,250
510717,Study of impact of COVID-19 on different age groups using machine learning classifiers,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical features, laboratory test results, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Healthy pregnant women are more susceptible to developing COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed clinical data from pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to two tertiary care hospitals in Turkey. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 24 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The mean maternal and gestational age was 26.9±5.37 years and 24.15±10.61 weeks, respectively. Cough was observed as the most common symptom (n=15; 62.5 %). The lowest lymphocyte percentage was 20.83±13.05 (%). Nine women have delivered by Caesarean section, while one had a vaginal birth. One woman with critical COVID-19 died 2 days later postpartum. The neonate had been transferred to neonatal intensive care unit and died within 24 hours of birth. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that except for one patient, the clinical course of COVID-19 during pregnancy was mild. Early hospitalization of pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19, liberal testing for SARS-CoV-2, active management with a multidisciplinary team seemed to be critical to recovery (Tab. 3, Ref. 31).","Ozsurmeli, M; Terzi, H; Hocaoglu, M; Bilir, R A; Gunay, T; Unsal, D; Turgut, A; Karateke, A",Bratisl Lek Listy,,250

However, this imposes a new paradigm on the architecture design of the integrated SIN. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) are the most promising techniques, conceived to improve communication and computation capability by reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment and offloading. Hence, converging RISs and MEC in SIN is becoming an effort to reap the double benefits of computation and communication. In this article, we propose an RIS-assisted collaborative MEC architecture for SIN and discuss its implementation. Then we present its potential benefits, major challenges, and feasible applications. Subsequently, we study different cases to evaluate the system data rate and latency.

Typical patterns of clinical and laboratory features match secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). However, the optimal approach to COVID-19 patients testing positive for sHLH is still unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS: Three patients with COVID-19 are reviewed. All showed hyperinflammation and cytokine storm, necessitating intensive care treatment including mechanical ventilation. DIAGNOSIS: Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis due to severe COVID-19; diagnosed via HScore. INTERVENTIONS: A treatment regimen of methylprednisolone, pentaglobin, and anakinra was developed and administered. OUTCOMES: One patient survived the ICU stay. Two other patients, in whom sHLH was diagnosed too late, deceased. LESSONS: A routine screening of COVID-19 patients for secondary HLH by using the HScore is feasible; especially those patients deteriorating clinically with no sufficient response to shock management might be at particular high risk. A stepwise therapeutic approach comprising corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and anakinra, accompanied by immunoadsorption, may dampen cytokine storm effects, and potentially reduce mortality.","Schnaubelt, Sebastian; Tihanyi, Daniel; Strassl, Robert; Schmidt, Ralf; Anders, Sonja; Laggner, Anton N; Agis, Hermine; Domanovits, Hans",Medicine (Baltimore),,250

Clustered Regularly Interspace Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), an important tool in genome engineering composed of guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 nuclease that makes an RNA-protein complex to digest exclusive target sequences implementation of gRNA. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 system effectively suppresses HSV-1 infection by knockout of some viral genes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To survey the efficacy of Cas9 system on HSV-1 genome destruction, we designed several guide RNAs (gRNAs) that all packaged in one vector. Also, we performed a one-step restriction using BamHI and ESP3I enzymes. RESULTS: CRISPR/Cas9 system targeted against the gD gene of HSV-1 was transfected into HEK-AD cells that moreover, revealed a significant reduction of HSV-1 infection by plaque assay and real-time PCR. CONCLUSION: The pCas-Guide-EF1a-GFP CRISPR Vector can create a fast and efficient method for gRNA cloning by restriction enzymes (ESP3I (BsmBI) and BamHI). Therefore, the CRISPR/Cas9 system may be utilized for the screening of genes significant for the HSV1 infection and the development of new strategies for targeted therapy of viral infections caused by HSV-1.","Khodadad, Nastaran; Fani, Mona; Jamehdor, Saleh; Nahidsamiei, Rahil; Makvandi, Manoochehr; Kaboli, Saeed; Teimoori, Ali; Thekkiniath, Jose",Folia histochem. cytobiol,,250

The sorption efficiency was studied on selected pharmaceuticals due to their common presence in aquatic ecosystems. The results show that the studied Biochar type removed the pharmaceuticals with high efficiency (above 90%), so this material can potentially be applied in wastewater treatment. We achieved greater than 99% efficiency in total RNA removal from wastewater. Wastewater might contain infectious RNA fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

516501,Preserving Family Presence During a Pandemic,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems across the world. To date, there has been little application of a race, migration and gender lens to explore the long-term health and social consequences of COVID-19 in African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities in Canada, who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. The evidence presented in this commentary suggests that recovery strategies need to adopt an intersectional lens taking into account race, migration and gender since ACB women and ACB immigrant women have been among the populations most impacted both personally and economically. To do so, there is an urgent need to incorporate variables capturing race, beyond ""visible minority"" status; gender, beyond looking at differences between women and men; and factors to help understand the complexities of migration trajectories (i.e., beyond the dichotomy of born in Canada versus not born in Canada categories) in Canadian datasets. We provide examples of policy and practice initiatives that will be urgently required to address the needs of these population groups as these race-based data become available.","Etowa, Josephine; Hyman, Ilene",Can J Public Health,,250

I argue that unexpected changes in housing variables can be a source of aggregate housing risk, and the first principal component extracted from the volatilities of U.S. housing variables can predict the expected REIT equity returns. I propose and construct a factor-based housing risk index as an additional factor in asset price models that uses the time-varying conditional volatility of housing variables within the U.S. housing sector. The findings show that the proposed housing risk index is economically and theoretically consistent with the risk-return relationship of the conditional Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) of Merton (1973), which predicts an average maximum of 5.6 percent of risk premium in REIT equity return. In subsample analyses, the positive relationship is not affected by sample periods' choice but shows higher housing risk beta values for the 2009-18 sample period. The relationship remains significant after controlling for VIX, Fama-French three factors, and a broad set of macroeconomic and financial variables. Moreover, the proposed housing beta also accurately forecasts U.S. macroeconomic and financial conditions.","Alam, Masud",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10455v1.pdf,250

The rationale to select the technique was based on the pandemic situations in the country i.e. COVID-19. Moreover, it was used to main social distancing and following the health safety measures. Thus, a well-structured questionnaire was administered based on an attitudinal scale and google form was used. The inclusion criteria were defined on the questionnaire such as an independent age bracket (18-60), resident of Pakistan, using social media, and literate. The response was stopped after reaching the sample at 1264 participants. The study findings reveal that social isolation, social distancing, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) had a significant positive impact on risk reduction of COVID-19 among individuals.

The swiftly rising of positive cases globally created panic, anxiety and depression among people. The effect of this deadly disease was found to be directly proportional to the physical and mental health of the population. As of 28 October 2020, more than 40 million people are tested positive and more than 1 million deaths have been recorded. The most dominant tool that disturbed human life during this time is social media. The tweets regarding COVID-19, whether it was a number of positive cases or deaths, induced a wave of fear and anxiety among people living in different parts of the world. Nobody can deny the truth that social media is everywhere and everybody is connected with it directly or indirectly. This offers an opportunity for researchers and data scientists to access the data for academic and research use. The social media data contains many data that relate to real-life events like COVID-19. In this paper, an analysis of Twitter data has been done through the R programming language. We have collected the Twitter data based on hashtag keywords, including COVID-19, coronavirus, deaths, new case, recovered. In this study, we have designed an algorithm called Hybrid Heterogeneous Support Vector Machine (H-SVM) and performed the sentiment classification and classified them positive, negative and neutral sentiment scores. We have also compared the performance of the proposed algorithm on certain parameters like precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).","Kaur, Harleen; Ahsaan, Shafqat Ul; Alankar, Bhavya; Chang, Victor",Inf Syst Front,,250

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with &#8805;10 patients; and experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants were patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, across all healthcare settings (hospital and community) and age groups (paediatric and adult). METHODS: The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness and age. We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic data were available from 30 623 patients. The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3-80.0%). On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.33) compared with adults. Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95% CI 1.18-1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95% CI 1.15-1.54). Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7-15.2%) from 31 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Three-quarters of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection. Unnecessary antibiotic use is likely to be high in patients with COVID-19.","Langford, Bradley J; So, Miranda; Raybardhan, Sumit; Leung, Valerie; Soucy, Jean-Paul R; Westwood, Duncan; Daneman, Nick; MacFadden, Derek R",Clin. microbiol. infect,,250
517826,SBiRM in the time of COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The ICU is a complex ecosystem in which intensive care physicians, advanced practice providers (APPs), pharmacists, and respiratory therapists work in concert to take care of critically ill patients. The SARS COV2 pandemic highlighted weaknesses in the American healthcare system. This article explores the ability of American healthcare to adapt to this challenge. RECENT FINDINGS: With the COVID-19 pandemic, intensivists, and ventilators have been identified as the most critical components leading to shortages in ICU capacity. Anesthesiologists play a unique role in being able to provide 'flex capacity' with critical care staffing, space, and equipment (post-anesthesia care units, operating rooms, and ventilators). With the advent of APPs, intensive care physician staffing ratios may potentially be increased to cover patients safely in a physician-led team model. Tele-medicine expands this further and can allow hospital coordination for optimizing ICU bed use. SUMMARY: Although intensivists have been able to take care of the increased ICU caseload during the COVID-19 pandemic through recruiting other specialties, the question of what is the appropriate staffing model for the future is yet to be elucidated. Creating stronger multidisciplinary care teams that have the capacity to flex up critical care capacity may be the most prudent longer-term solution.","Hussain, Rashid S; Kataria, Tripti C",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,,250
518091,Reply to Zhang et al.: Slowing the rate of spread of COVID-19,2020-07-01,"Swedish measures to fight the spread of COVID-19 differ from the strategies used in other comparable countries. In contrast to the lockdown approach that has been applied in many European countries, the Swedish strategy has been based to a substantial extent on individuals taking responsibility under non-binding recommendations. This contribution explores the Swedish strategy from a constitutional and administrative law perspective, highlighting the tension between the formalist system for delegating norms under the Swedish Constitution and the pragmatic use of non-binding rules such as the General Recommendations adopted by the Public Health Agency. The article concludes that the official use of soft law instruments is confusing from a legal perspective, because non-binding rules do not offer the traditional formal mechanisms for legal protection, the publication of norms or accountability. The legal-realist approach of the Supreme Administrative Court's case law, however, has the potential of balancing some of the unfortunate effects arising from the Swedish combination of formalism and pragmatism. ©","Wenander, H.",European Journal of Risk Regulation,,250

Therefore, the RBD is a promising vaccine target to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we report the development of an RBD protein-based vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 using self-assembling Helicobacter pylori-bullfrog ferritin nanoparticles as an antigen delivery system. RBD-ferritin protein purified from mammalian cells efficiently assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. Sixteen- to 20-month-old ferrets were vaccinated with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RBD nanoparticles) by intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. All vaccinated ferrets with RBD nanoparticles produced potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, vaccinated ferrets demonstrated efficient protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, showing no fever, body weight loss, or clinical symptoms. Furthermore, vaccinated ferrets showed rapid clearance of infectious virus in nasal washes and lungs as well as of viral RNA in respiratory organs. This study demonstrates that spike RBD-nanoparticles are an effective protein vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.","Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Dokyun; Yu, Kwang-Min; Seo, Hogyu David; Lee, Shin-Ae; Casel, Mark Anthony B; Jang, Seung-Gyu; Kim, Stephanie; Jung, WooRam; Lai, Chih-Jen; Choi, Young Ki; Jung, Jae U",mBio (Online),,250
520759,Modeling of Vaccination and Contact Tracing as Tools to Control the COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain,2021,"Respiratory virus challenge studies involve administration of the challenge virus and sampling to assess for protection from the same anatomical locations. It can therefore be difficult to differentiate actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. For SARS-CoV-2, specific monitoring of actively replicating virus is critical to investigate the protective and therapeutic efficacy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antiviral drugs. We developed a SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) RT-PCR assay to differentiate productive infection from inactivated or neutralized virus. Subgenomic RNAs are generated after cell entry and are poorly incorporate into mature virions, and thus may provide a marker for actively replicating virus. We show envelope (E) sgRNA was degraded by RNase in infected cell lysates, while genomic RNA (gRNA) was protected, presumably due to packaging into virions. To investigate the capacity of the sgRNA assay to distinguish input challenge virus from actively replicating virus in vivo, we compared the E sgRNA assay to a standard nucleoprotein (N) or E total RNA assay in convalescent rhesus macaques and in antibody-treated rhesus macaques after experimental SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In both studies, the E sgRNA assay was negative, suggesting protective efficacy, whereas the N and E total RNA assays remained positive. These data suggest the potential utility of sgRNA to monitor actively replicating virus in prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 studies.ImportanceDeveloping therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a public health priority. During challenge studies, respiratory viruses are delivered and sampled from the same anatomical location. It is therefore important to distinguish actively replicating virus from input challenge virus. The most common assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting nucleocapsid total RNA, cannot distinguish neutralized input virus from replicating virus. In this study, we assess SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA as a potential measure of replicating virus in rhesus macaques.","Dagotto, Gabriel; Mercado, Noe B; Martinez, David R; Hou, Yixuan J; Nkolola, Joseph P; Carnahan, Robert H; Crowe, James E; Baric, Ralph S; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,,250

Most of these neonates are referred from maternity ward of the hospital. However, there is no recent evidence on the prevalence and specific determinants of birth asphyxia at DTGH. Besides, public health importance of factors like birth spacing weren't addressed in the prior studies. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 240 newborns at delivery ward. The collected data were cleaned, coded and entered into Epi -data version 4.2 and exported to Stata version 14. Binary logistic regression model was considered and statistical significance was declared at P< 0.05 using adjusted odds ratio. Results: The prevalence of asphyxia neonatorum was 6.7 % based on the fifth minute APGAR score. From multi-variable logistic regression analysis, antenatal obstetric complications (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 3.75, 14.29), fetal malpresentation (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.21, 15.20), premature rupture of fetal membranes (AOR = 6.56, 95% CI: 3.48, 18.12) and meconium stained amniotic fluid (AOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.76, 14.59) were significant predictors. Conclusion: The prevalence of fifth minute asphyxia neonatorum was relatively low. Fortunately, its predictors are modifiable.

Para tal, realizouse três experimentos a partir de três dietas contendo milho, quirera de arroz ou sorgo. No primeiro estudo, 375 juvenis, com 12,13±0,09 g foram distribuídos em 15 tanques (280L), alimentados com dieta extrusada, três vezes ao dia, até saciedade, por 60 dias. O delineamento foi o inteiramente casualizado com três tratamentos e cinco repetições. Os resultados obtidos foram submetidos a ANOVA e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Duncan (5%). No segundo estudo, animais foram submetidos à avaliação da glicemia pós-prandial, portanto, permaneceram 12 horas em jejum. A colheita do sangue ocorreu no tempo zero (antes da realimentação) e 1, 3, 6, 9 e 12 horas pós-alimentação. No terceiro estudo, 100 animais com 56,32±0,85g foram utilizados para determinar a digestibilidade das dietas experimentais em quatro tanques cilíndricos de fundo cônico (190 L), para decantação das fezes. Realizou-se a coleta de uma dieta por vez, com quatro repetições. Não houve mortalidade; o peso final, ganho de peso, ganho médio diário, ganho em peso relativo, fator de condição, consumo alimentar, taxa de crescimento específico, comprimento total, conversão alimentar, triglicerídeos, lipoproteína de densidade muito baixa, alanina aminotransferase, coeficiente de retenção proteica e digestibilidade foram semelhantes entre as dietas (P > 0,05). Lipoproteínas de alta densidade, proteínas totais, globulinas, proteína hepática, amônia hepática, glicose hepática, glicogênio hepático, proteína corporal, rendimento de carcaça foram mais elevados com o uso de sorgo (P < 0,05). A lipoproteína de baixa densidade foi maior quando do fornecimento de milho. A glicose plasmática foi mais elevada nos tratamentos com milho e quirera de arroz. O uso de sorgo levou a menores valores de índices hepatossomáticos, gordura visceral, digestivossomático, albumina, colesterol e quociente intestinal. As enzimas amilase, lipase, tripsina e maltase reduziram suas atividades nos animas alimentados com a dieta com sorgo. A dieta com quirera de arroz resultou em maiores teores de lipídios, coeficiente de retenção lipídica, aminoácidos livre no fígado, amônia hepática e glicose hepática. Para matéria seca, proteína e cinzas não houve diferença. Na curva glicêmica, verificou-se picos de glicemia com 3,5 e 4 horas após ingestão das dietas contendo sorgo e arroz, respectivamente, enquanto para o milho o maior valor foi após 12 horas da alimentação. A digestibilidade da matéria seca, proteína e lipídios não diferiu entre os tratamentos. Por conseguinte, os estudos demonstraram que milho, quirera de arroz ou sorgo na dieta de juvenis de pacu são adequadamente utilizadas pela espécie, sem qualquer efeito adverso sobre o crescimento e sobrevivência. O milho denota um perfil metabólico de melhor aproveitamento dos carboidratos da dieta. A quirera de arroz e sorgo geram aumento no catabolismo de aminoácidos para manter os processos de produção de energia. Há aumento de produção de compostos nitrogenados de excreção tanto nos tratamentos com quirera quanto sorgo. O sorgo apresentou maior rendimento de carcaça e teor de proteína no peixe inteiro.","FLORA, MARCO AURELIO LOPES DELLA",,,250

523987,ECG Images dataset of Cardiac and COVID-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID(coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic is characterized by high infectivity, droplet transmission, and high viral load in the upper respiratory tract. Severe disease courses are associated with interstitial pneumonia and ventilated patients, in whom tracheotomy (TT)-a droplet- and aerosol-producing medical intervention-is regularly necessary. TT as a potential infection risk for medical staff is scarcely found in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify droplet exposure of the surgical team during TT, to better define the requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical TT was performed in four non-infectious patients, during which the surgeon and his assistant both wore a surgical nasal mask with a transparent visor. After the procedure, the type, distribution, and number of droplets on the visor were determined macroscopically and microscopically. RESULTS: An average of 29 droplets were found on the middle third of the visor, 4 on the right third, and 13 on the left third, with an average droplet size of 571â¯µm (±â¯381â¯µm). The smallest droplets were 55â¯µm, the largest 1431â¯µm. An increase in the number of droplets was found with increased ventilation during the procedure. Blood droplets were more common than secretion droplets. CONCLUSION: Contamination of the visor with droplets was demonstrated. Especially in the case of TT in highly infectious patients, e.g., COVID-19 patients, the use of hooded headgear in combination with breathing apparatus with air purification and power supply is recommended to ensure best protection from infection for the surgeon and the surgical assistant.","Plettenberg, C; Geipel, K; Stenin, I; Klenzner, T; Wagenmann, M; Schipper, J; Scheckenbach, K",HNO,,250

We aimed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic value of conventional and non-conventional APA in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This study was a multi-centric, prospective observational French cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 suspicion. RESULTS: 249 patients were hospitalized for suspected COVID-19, including 154 with confirmed COVID-19 and 95 not confirmed. We found a significant increase in lupus anticoagulant (LA) positivity among COVID-19 positive patients (60.9% versus 23.7% in non-COVID19 patients, p<0.001), while prevalence of conventional (anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta-2-GP1, IgG and IgM isotypes) and non-conventional APA (IgA, anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin and anti-prothrombin IgG and IgM) were low in both groups. COVID-19 patients with LA positivity had higher levels of fibrinogen (6.0 IQR 5.0-7.0 versus 5.3 g/L IQR 4.3-6.4, p=0.028) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 115.5 IQR 66.0-204.8 versus 91.8 mg/L IQR 27.0-155.1, p=0.019). Univariate analysis did not show any association between LA positivity and higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE, OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.44-2.43, p=0.95) or in-hospital mortality (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.70-5.05, p=0.24). Unadjusted and adjusted (to CRP, age and sex) Kaplan-Meier survival curves according to LA positivity confirmed the absence of association with VTE or in-hospital mortality (unadjusted: p=0.64 and p=0.26, respectively; adjusted: hazard ratio = 1.13 95% CI 0.48-2.60 and 1.80 95% CI 0.67-5.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have an increased prevalence of LA positivity associated with biological inflammation markers. However, positive LA at admission is not associated with VTE risk and/or in-hospital mortality.","Gendron, Nicolas; Dragon-Durey, Marie-Agnès; Chocron, Richard; Darnige, Luc; Jourdi, Georges; Philippe, Aurélien; Chenevier-Gobeaux, Camille; Hadjadj, Jérôme; Duchemin, Jérôme; Khider, Lina; Yatim, Nader; Goudot, Guillaume; Krzisch, Daphné; Debuc, Benjamin; Mauge, Laetitia; Levasseur, Françoise; Pene, Frédéric; Boussier, Jeremy; Sourdeau, Elise; Brichet, Julie; Ochat, Nadège; Goulvestre, Claire; Peronino, Christophe; Szwebel, Tali-Anne; Pages, Franck; Gaussem, Pascale; Samama, Charles-Marc; Cheurfa, Cherifa; Planquette, Benjamin; Sanchez, Olivier; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Fontenay, Michaela; Terrier, Benjamin; Smadja, David M",Arthritis rheumatol.

591373,Get comfortable with being uncomfortable: Experiences from diagnostic radiographers a year into the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-05-14,"Testing donations for pathogens and deferring selected blood donors have reduced the risk of transmission of known pathogens by transfusion to extremely low levels in most developed countries. Protecting the blood supply from emerging infectious threats remains a serious concern in the transfusion medicine community. Transfusion services can employ indirect measures such as surveillance, hemovigilance, and donor questioning (defense), protein-, or nucleic acid based direct testing (detection), or pathogen inactivation of blood products (destruction) as strategies to mitigate the risk of transmission-transmitted infection. In the North American context, emerging threats currently include dengue, chikungunya, and hepatitis E viruses, and Babesia protozoan parasites. The 2003 SARS and 2014 Ebola outbreaks illustrate the potential of epidemics unlikely to be transmitted by blood transfusion but disruptive to blood systems. Donor-free blood products such as ex vivo generated red blood cells offer a theoretical way to avoid transmission-transmitted infection risk, although biological, engineering, and manufacturing challenges must be overcome before this approach becomes practical. Similarly, next generation sequencing of all nucleic acid in a blood sample is currently possible but impractical for generalized screening. Pathogen inactivation systems are in use in different jurisdictions around the world, and are starting to gain regulatory approval in North America. Cost concerns make it likely that pathogen inactivation will be contemplated by blood operators through the lens of health economics and risk-based decision making, rather than in zero-risk paradigms previously embraced for transfusable products. Defense of the blood supply from infectious disease risk will continue to require innovative combinations of surveillance, detection, and pathogen avoidance or inactivation.","Walsh, Geraldine M.; Shih, Andrew W.; Solh, Ziad; Golder, Mia; Schubert, Peter; Fearon, Margaret; Sheffield, William P.",Transfus Med Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmrv.2016.02.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887796316300050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26962008/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887796316300050,250

The health department of the fourth largest city in the U.S. recognized that sound estimates of viral impact were needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: Adapting standardized disaster research methodology in September 2020, the city was divided into high and low strata based on RT-PCR positivity rates, and census block groups within each stratum were randomly selected with probability proportional to size, followed by random selection of households within each group. Using two immunoassays, the proportion of infected individuals was estimated for the city, as well as by positivity rate and by sociodemographic and other characteristics. The degree of under ascertainment of seroprevalence was estimated based on RT-PCR positive cases. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was estimated to be 14% with a near two-fold difference in areas with high (18%) versus low (10%) RT-PCR positivity rates and was four times higher compared to case-based surveillance data. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence was higher than previously reported and is greater than that estimated from RT-PCR data. Results will be used to inform public health decisions about testing, outreach, and vaccine rollout.","Symanski, Elaine; Ensor, Katherine B; Piedra, Pedro A; Sheth, Komal; Caton, Kelsey; Williams, Stephen L; Persse, David; Banerjee, Deborah; Hopkins, Loren",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914068/,250
591812,Modeling the spread of COVID-19 in Germany: Early assessment and possible scenarios,2020-09-04,"Viral-associated respiratory infectious diseases are one of the most prominent subsets of respiratory failures, known as viral respiratory infections (VRI). VRIs are proceeded by an infection caused by viruses infecting the respiratory system. For the past 100 years, viral associated respiratory epidemics have been the most common cause of infectious disease worldwide. Due to several drawbacks of the current anti-viral treatments, such as drug resistance generation and non-targeting of viral proteins, the development of novel nanotherapeutic or nano-vaccine strategies can be considered essential. Due to their specific physical and biological properties, nanoparticles hold promising opportunities for both anti-viral treatments and vaccines against viral infections. Besides the specific physiological properties of the respiratory system, there is a significant demand for utilizing nano-designs in the production of vaccines or antiviral agents for airway-localized administration. SARS-CoV-2, as an immediate example of respiratory viruses, is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the coronaviridae family. COVID-19 can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, similarly to other members of the coronaviridae. Hence, reviewing the current and past emerging nanotechnology-based medications on similar respiratory viral diseases can identify pathways towards generating novel SARS-CoV-2 nanotherapeutics and/or nano-vaccines.","Seyfoori, Amir; Shokrollahi Barough, Mahdieh; Mokarram, Pooneh; Ahmadi, Mazaher; Mehrbod, Parvaneh; Sheidary, Alireza; Madrakian, Tayyebeh; Kiumarsi, Mohammad; Walsh, Tavia; McAlinden, Kielan D.; Ghosh, Chandra C.; Sharma, Pawan; Zeki, Amir A.; Ghavami, Saeid; Akbari, Mohsen",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203268/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136937,250

METHODS: We describe a cohort of critically ill patients during the first two months of the pandemic (from March 3, 2020, to May 2, 2020) in HUVH, Barcelona. In this manuscript, we report our previsions, strategies implemented, and the outcomes obtained. RESULTS: Three-thousand and thirty-three patients were admitted to the HUVH Critical Care Units. Throughout the study period, the proportion of patients on IMV or IMV and ECMO remained above 78%. Most patients were men (65%); the most common age group was 60-70 years. Twenty-three patients received ECMO, and eighteen were cannulated at another center and transferred to HUVH. At the end of the study, fourteen patients were successfully decannulated, three patients died, and the rest of the patients were still on ECMO. Eight pregnant women have been treated in the ICU, with a survival rate of 100%. The ICU mortality of patients younger than 60 years was 3.2%. The mean ICU stay of both survivors and nonsurvivors was 14 days.

594503,COVID-19 and the Growth Potential,2021-01-26,"BACKGROUND: Welfare technologies are often described as a solution to the increasing pressure on primary health care services. However, despite initiating welfare technology projects in the health care sector and different government incentives, research indicates that it is difficult to integrate welfare technology innovations in a complex and varying setting, such as long-term care. OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the types of welfare technology and the extent to which welfare technology is provided in long-term care (ie, nursing homes and home care services); examine whether the extent of welfare technology provision differs on the basis of municipal characteristics (ie, population size, centrality, the proportion of older inhabitants, and income); and identify how local governments (ie, municipalities) describe their efforts toward integrating welfare technologies in long-term care. METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative data about welfare technology from a larger cross-sectional survey about the provision of long-term care services in Norwegian municipalities were combined with registry data. Representatives of 422 Norwegian municipalities were invited to participate in the survey. Frequencies were used to describe the distribution of the types and extent of welfare technologies, whereas the Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance were used to determine the association between the extent of welfare technology and municipal characteristics. Free-form text data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 277 municipalities were surveyed. Technology for safety was the most widespread type of welfare technology, whereas technology for social contact was the least prevalent. Two-thirds of the sample (183/277, 66.1%) in nursing home and (197/277, 71.1%) in home care services reported providing one or two different types of welfare technology. There was a statistically significant association between the extent of welfare technology and population size (in both nursing homes and home care services: P=.01), centrality (nursing homes: P=.01; home care services: P<.001), and municipal income (nursing homes: P=.02; home care services: P<.001). The extent of welfare technology was not associated with the proportion of older adults. The municipalities described being in a piloting phase and committing to future investment in welfare technology. Monetary resources were allocated, competency development among staff was initiated, and the municipalities were concerned about establishing collaborations within and between municipalities. Home care services seem to have a more person-centered approach in their efforts toward integrating welfare technologies, whereas nursing homes seem to have a more technology-centered approach. CONCLUSIONS: Many municipalities provide welfare technologies; however, their extent is limited and varies according to municipal characteristics. Municipal practices still seem dominated by piloting, and welfare technologies are not fully integrated into long-term care services. Innovation with welfare technology appears top-down and is influenced by national policy but also reflects creating a window of opportunity through the organization of municipal efforts toward integrating welfare technology through, for example, collaborations and committing personnel and financial resources.","Rostad, Hanne Marie; Stokke, Randi",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398791/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22316,250

Our research with organisations founded and led by refugees, termed here refugee-led organisations (RLOs), in camps and cities in Kenya and Uganda shows their potential to be an asset in the response to COVID-19 and in contributing to more effective and participatory forms of humanitarian assistance. In this research note we draw on pre-pandemic research with around 80 RLOs and follow-up research with 15 in Uganda and Kenya who are actively responding to the pandemic and its effects. We identify five key areas in which refugees are or could be involved as responders to COVID-19 and other pandemics: providing public information, supplementing capacity gaps, healthcare delivery, shaping social norms, and virus tracking and contact tracing. Our research during COVID-19 shows how RLOs have pivoted their existing service provision to fill assistance gaps, including in areas directly related to public health. As the humanitarian system searches for ways to implement remote and participatory approaches to refugee assistance, RLOs offer great potential, if mechanisms can be found to identify those that are effective, provide them with funding, and build their capacities.","Betts, Alexander; Easton-Calabria, Evan; Pincock, Kate",World Dev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20304381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250552/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105311; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20304381?v=s5,250

The risks to academia become larger when such retractions take place in high-ranking biomedical journals. In some cases, retractions result from unreliable or nonexistent data, an issue that could easily be avoided by having open data policies, but there have also been retractions due to oversight in peer review and editorial verification. As COVID-19 continues to affect academics and societies around the world, failures in peer review might also constitute a public health risk. The effectiveness by which COVID-19 literature is corrected, including through retractions, depends on the stringency of measures in place to detect errors and to correct erroneous literature.

Its severity ranges from mild to severe, latter manifesting into severe acute respiratory syndrome. As a part of multidisciplinary team, physiotherapy along with medical management was administered to patients with COVID-19 in an acute care setup. This retrospective study aims to explore various patient characteristics and will aid in identifying the impairments associated with the disease, giving a direction to the physiotherapy community in planning future management strategy to improve quality of life. Patients and methods: The present study is a unicentric study wherein prospective analysis of retrospective data of patients referred for physiotherapy from May 13 to July 31, 2020, was performed. (i) Characteristics of patients, (ii) associated comorbidities, (iii) hospital course since the time of admission to discharge, (iv) mode of oxygen delivery, (v) pre- and post-physiotherapy treatment values of oxygen saturation and heart rate, and (vi) physiotherapy treatment were recorded. The archived data were analyzed using the commercially available SPSS software version 24. Wilcoxon's matched pair test was used to compare pre- and post-treatment oxygen saturation and heart rate, and McNemar's test was used to compare mode of oxygen delivery and pre- and post-physiotherapy treatment. Results: Descriptive analysis of data showed a better outcome in terms of grade of dyspnea and rate of discharge on day 14 of physiotherapy treatment. Hence, a comparative analysis of day 1 and day 14 was performed for mode of oxygen delivery, oxygen saturation, and heart rate. A statistically significant improvement was observed in the heart rate (p = 0.001) and oxygen delivery (p = 0.000). However, no significant difference in the level of oxygen saturation was found (p = 0.6433). Conclusion: Physiotherapy treatment in conjunction with medical treatment can be effectively administered in patients with COVID-19 in acute care setup taking into consideration the health status and the hemodynamic stability of the patients. It emphasizes the role of physiotherapy in the alleviation of symptoms, facilitating early weaning and recovery enabling early discharge from the hospital.

598043,Effects of COVID-19 on Business and Research,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Physical distancing measures taken to contain COVID-19 transmission may substantially reduce physical activity levels and cause individuals to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if there was any change in daily steps, an important component of daily physical activity, and examine risk factors for frequent low daily steps during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used data collected from the Step Study, a population-based longitudinal study of walking activity among residents aged ≥40 years in Changsha, China. Daily steps were collected via a smartphone linked to WeChat, a social networking platform. We plotted mean daily steps and the prevalence of low daily steps (≤1500 steps/day) 30 days before (reference period) and 30 days after (epidemic period) January 21, 2020 (date of the first COVID-19 case diagnosed in Changsha), and compared it with the same corresponding period from 2019. We examined the association of risk factors with the prevalence of frequent low daily steps (≤1500 steps/day for ≥14 days) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 3544 participants (mean age 51.6 years; n=1226 females, 34.6%), mean daily steps dropped from 8097 to 5440 and the prevalence of low daily steps increased from 3% (2287/76,136 person-day) to 18.5% (12,951/70,183 person-day) during the reference and epidemic periods, respectively. No such phenomenon was observed during the corresponding period in 2019. Older age (P for interaction=.001) and female sex (P for interaction<.001) were both associated with a higher prevalence of frequent low daily steps and were more pronounced during the epidemic period. More education was associated with a lower prevalence of frequent low daily steps during the reference period but not the epidemic period (P for interaction=.34). Body mass index or comorbidity were not associated with frequent low daily steps during either period. CONCLUSIONS: Daily steps of Changsha residents aged ≥40 years dropped significantly during the COVID-19 period, especially among older adults and females. Although successful physical distancing, measured by the rapid downward trend in daily step counts of residents, played a critical role in the containment of the COVID-19 epidemic, our findings of an increase in the prevalence of frequent low daily steps raise concerns about unintended effects on physical activity.","Wang, Yilun; Zhang, Yuqing; Bennell, Kim; White, Daniel Kenta; Wei, Jie; Wu, Ziying; He, Hongyi; Liu, Shaohui; Luo, Xianghang; Hu, Shuo; Zeng, Chao; Lei, Guanghua",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027035/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21632,250

This newly emerging pathogen is highly transmittable and can cause fatal disease. More than 35 million cases have been confirmed, with a fatality rate of about 2.9% to October 9, 2020. However, the original and intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. Here, 3160 poultry samples collected from 14 provinces of China between September and December 2019 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All the samples were SARS-CoV-2 negative, but 593 avian coronaviruses were detected, including 485 avian infectious bronchitis viruses, 72 duck coronaviruses, and 36 pigeon coronaviruses, with positivity rates of 15.35%, 2.28%, and 1.14%, respectively. Our surveillance demonstrates the diversity of avian coronaviruses in China, with higher prevalence rates in some regions. Furthermore, the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a known avian-origin coronavirus can be preliminarily ruled out. More surveillance of and research into avian coronaviruses are required to better understand the diversity, distribution, cross-species transmission, and clinical significance of these viruses.","Li, Yang; Zhuang, Qingye; Jiang, Lijian; Jiang, Wenming; Peng, Cheng; Jiang, Nan; Zhang, Fuyou; Yu, Xiaohui; Wang, Suchun; Yuan, Liping; Hou, Guangyu; Liu, Shuo; Wang, Jingjing; Yu, Jianmin; Li, Jinping; Zhao, Chenglong; Huang, Baoxu; Liu, Hualei; Wang, Kaicheng",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582833/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170221002732; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198566; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170221002732?v=s5,250
598271,The lived experiences of graduate nurses transitioning to professional practice during a pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Many proteomics-based and bioinformatics-based efforts are made to detect the molecular mechanism of COVID-19 infection. Identification of the main protein targets and pathways of severe cases of COVID-19 infection is the aim of this study. METHODS: Published differentially expressed proteins were screened and the significant proteins were investigated via protein-protein interaction network using Cytoscape software V. 3.7.2 and STRING database. The studied proteins were assessed via action map analysis to determine the relationship between individual proteins using CluePedia. The related biological terms were investigated using ClueGO and the terms were clustered and discussed. RESULTS: Among the 35 queried proteins, six of them (FGA, FGB, FGG, and FGl1 plus TLN1 and THBS1) were identified as critical proteins. A total of 38 biological terms, clustered in 4 groups, were introduced as the affected terms. “Platelet degranulation” and “hereditary factor I deficiency disease” were introduced as the main class of the terms disturbed by COVID-19 virus. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that platelet damage and disturbed haemostasis could be the main targets in severe cases of coronavirus infection. It is vital to follow patients’ condition by examining the introduced critical differentially expressed proteins (DEPs).","Zamanian-Azodi, Mona; Arjmand, Babak; Razzaghi, Mohammadreza; Rezaei Tavirani, Mostafa; Ahmadzadeh, Alireza; Rostaminejad, Mohammad",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027422/; https://doi.org/10.22037/aaem.v9i1.1108,250

The generation of autoantibodies has been proposed as a mechanism to explain these symptoms. To understand the prevalence of autoantibodies associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, we investigated the frequency and specificity of clinically relevant autoantibodies in 84 individuals previously infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, suffering from COVID‐19 of varying severity in both the acute and convalescent setting. These were compared with results from 32 individuals who were on the intensive therapy unit (ITU) for non‐COVID reasons. We demonstrate a higher frequency of autoantibodies in the COVID‐19 ITU group compared with non‐COVID‐19 ITU disease control patients and that autoantibodies were also found in the serum 3–5 months post‐COVID‐19 infection. Non‐COVID patients displayed a diverse pattern of autoantibodies; in contrast, the COVID‐19 groups had a more restricted panel of autoantibodies including skin, skeletal muscle and cardiac antibodies. Our results demonstrate that respiratory viral infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 is associated with the detection of a limited profile of tissue‐specific autoantibodies, detectable using routine clinical immunology assays. Further studies are required to determine whether these autoantibodies are specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 or a phenomenon arising from severe viral infections and to determine the clinical significance of these autoantibodies.","Richter, Alex G.; Shields, Adrian M.; Karim, Abid; Birch, David; Faustini, Sian E.; Steadman, Lora; Ward, Kerensa; Plant, Timothy; Reynolds, Gary; Veenith, Tonny; Cunningham, Adam F.; Drayson, Mark T.; Wraith, David C.",Clin Exp Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082475/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13623,250

The viral diseases of rabbits are discussed in an order based on the taxonomic groups to which the viruses belong and are independent of the order of importance of the various diseases. The material is presented under uniform subject headings, including history, etiology, epidemiology, clinical signs, pathology, diagnosis, and control. Control is interpreted broadly and includes both prevention and eradication. Some viral infections of rabbits have provided fundamental information on basic mechanisms of agent–host interrelationships, e.g., Myxoma virus, and others have been useful as models for human diseases, e.g., Rotavirus. The principal emphasis is on virus infections of domestic rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus. Naturally occurring and experimental infections of other rabbits and hares are also discussed in this chapter. Incoming rabbits are obtained from sources free of infections but appropriate quarantine and screening measures are standard operating procedures. None of the viral infections of rabbits is known to be of public health importance as there are no reports of the definitive spread of viruses from rabbits to humans.","Brabb, Thea; Di Giacomo, Ronald F.","The Laboratory Rabbit, Guinea Pig, Hamster, and Other Rodents",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123809209000146; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123809209000146,250
599121,"Face touching in the time of COVID-19 in Shiraz, Iran",2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury is a common finding in COVID‐19 strongly associated with severity. We analysed the prevalence and prognostic utility of myocardial injury, characterized by elevated cardiac troponin, in a large population of COVID‐19 patients, and further evaluated separately the role of troponin T and I. METHODS: This is a multicentre, retrospective observational study enrolling patients with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 who were hospitalized in 32 Spanish hospitals. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values above the sex‐specific 99th percentile upper reference limit, as recommended by international guidelines. Thirty‐day mortality was defined as endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 1280 COVID‐19 patients were included in this study, of whom 187 (14.6%) died during the hospitalization. Using a nonspecific sex cut‐off, elevated troponin levels were found in 344 patients (26.9%), increasing to 384 (30.0%) when a sex‐specific cut‐off was used. This prevalence was significantly higher (42.9% vs 21.9%; P < .001) in patients in whom troponin T was measured in comparison with troponin I. Sex‐specific elevated troponin levels were significantly associated with 30‐day mortality, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 3.00 for total population, 3.20 for cardiac troponin T and 3.69 for cardiac troponin I. CONCLUSION: In this multicentre study, myocardial injury was a common finding in COVID‐19 patients. Its prevalence increased when a sex‐specific cut‐off and cardiac troponin T were used. Elevated troponin was an independent predictor of 30‐day mortality, irrespective of cardiac troponin assay and cut‐offs to detect myocardial injury. Hence, the early measurement of cardiac troponin may be useful for risk stratification in COVID‐19.","García de Guadiana‐Romualdo, Luis; Morell‐García, Daniel; Rodríguez‐Fraga, Olaia; Morales‐Indiano, Cristian; María Lourdes Padilla Jiménez, Ana; Gutiérrez Revilla, José Ignacio; Urrechaga, Eloísa; Álamo, José María; Hernando Holgado, Ana María; Lorenzo‐Lozano, María del Carmen; Sánchez Fdez‐Pacheco, Silvia; de la Hera Cagigal, Patricia; Juncos Tobarra, María Ángeles; Vílchez, Juan A.; Vírseda Chamorro, Isabel; Gutiérrez Garcia, Irene; Pastor Murcia, Yolanda; Sahuquillo Frías, Laura; Altimira Queral, Laura; Nuez‐Zaragoza, Elisa; Adell Ruiz de León, Juan; Ruiz Ripa, Alicia; Salas Gómez‐Pablos, Paloma; Cebreiros López, Iria; Fernández Uriarte, Amaia; Larruzea, Álex; López Yepes, María Luisa; Sancho‐Rodríguez, Natalia; Zamorano Andrés, María Consuelo; Pedregosa Díaz, José; Acevedo Alcaraz, Cristina; Blázquez Manzanera, Alfonso‐L; Pérez Sanmartín, Sonia; Baamonde Calzada, María del Carmen; Vera, Marina; Valera Nuñez, Elena; Canalda Campás, Magdalena; García Muñoz, Sara; Bauça, Josep Miquel; Vicente Gutiérrez, Luis; Jiménez Añón, Laura; Pérez Martínez, Alfonso; Pons Castillo, Aurelio; González Tamayo, Ruth; Férriz Vivancos, Jorge; José Alcaide Martín, María; Ferrer Díaz de Brito Fernández, Vicente; Aguadero, Vicente; García Arévalo, María Gloria; Arnaldos Carrillo, María; González Morales, Mercedes; Núñez Gárate, María; Ruiz Iruela, Cristina; Esteban Torrella, Patricia; Vila Pérez, Martí; Egea‐Caparrós, Jose Manuel; Sáenz, Luis; Galán Ortega, Amparo; Consuegra‐Sánchez, Luciano",Eur J Clin Invest,https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660278/,250

However, treatment uptake is declining which could potentially undermine Australia’s progress towards the WHO HCV elimination targets. Using mathematical modelling, we updated estimates for those living with chronic HCV in Australia, new cases of decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver-related mortality among the HCV-cured and viraemic populations from 2015 to 2030. We considered various DAA treatment scenarios incorporating annual treatment numbers to 2020, and subsequent uptake per year of 6,790 (pessimistic), 8,100 (intermediate), and 11,310 (optimistic). We incorporated the effects of excess alcohol consumption and reduction in progression to DC and HCC among cirrhosis-cured versus viraemic individuals. At the end of 2020, we estimated 117,810 Australians were living with chronic HCV. New cases per year of DC, HCC, and liver-related mortality among the HCV viraemic population decreased rapidly from 2015 (almost eliminated by 2030). In contrast, the growing population size of those cured with advanced liver disease meant DC, HCC, and liver-related mortality declined slowly. The estimated reduction in liver-related mortality from 2015 to 2030 in the combined HCV viraemic and cured population is 25% in the intermediate scenario. With declining HCV treatment uptake and ongoing individual-level risk of advanced liver disease complications, including among cirrhosis-cured individuals, Australia is unlikely to achieve all WHO HCV elimination targets by 2030.","Kwon, Jisoo A.; Dore, Gregory J.; Hajarizadeh, Behzad; Alavi, Maryam; Valerio, Heather; Grebely, Jason; Guy, Rebecca; Gray, Richard T.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529711/,250

600911,Registered nurse perceptions of factors contributing to the inconsistent brand image of the nursing profession,2020-08-04,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies. Present-day treatments have not shown real improvements in reducing the high mortality rate and the short survival of the disease. The average survival is less than 5% after 5 years. New innovative treatments are necessary to curtail the situation. The very dense pancreatic cancer stroma is a barrier that impedes the access of chemotherapeutic drugs and at the same time establishes a pro-proliferative symbiosis with the tumor, thus targeting the stroma has been suggested by many authors. No ideal drug or drug combination for this targeting has been found as yet. With this goal in mind, here we have explored a different complementary treatment based on abundant previous publications on repurposed drugs. The cell surface protein CD44 is the main receptor for hyaluronan binding. Many malignant tumors show over-expression/over-activity of both. This is particularly significant in pancreatic cancer. The independent inhibition of hyaluronan-producing cells, hyaluronan synthesis, and/or CD44 expression, has been found to decrease the tumor cell’s proliferation, motility, invasion, and metastatic abilities. Targeting the hyaluronan-CD44 pathway seems to have been bypassed by conventional mainstream oncological practice. There are existing drugs that decrease the activity/expression of hyaluronan and CD44: 4-methylumbelliferone and bromelain respectively. Some drugs inhibit hyaluronan-producing cells such as pirfenidone. The association of these three drugs has never been tested either in the laboratory or in the clinical setting. We present a hypothesis, sustained by hard experimental evidence, suggesting that the simultaneous use of these nontoxic drugs can achieve synergistic or added effects in reducing invasion and metastatic potential, in PDAC. A non-toxic, low-cost scheme for inhibiting this pathway may offer an additional weapon for treating pancreatic cancer.","Koltai, Tomas; Reshkin, Stephan Joel; Carvalho, Tiago M.

However, current methods for viral detection in wastewater are severely lacking in terms of scaling up for high throughput. In the present study, we employed an automated magnetic-bead based concentration approach for viral detection in sewage that can effectively be scaled up for processing 24 samples in a single 40-minute run. The method compared favorably to conventionally used methods for viral wastewater concentrations with higher recovery efficiencies from input sample volumes as low as 10ml and can enable the processing of over 100 wastewater samples in a day. The sensitivity of the high-throughput protocol was shown to detect cases as low as 2 in a hospital building with a known COVID-19 caseload. Using the high throughput pipeline, samples from the influent stream of the primary wastewater treatment plant of San Diego county (serving 2.3 million residents) were processed for a period of 13 weeks. Wastewater estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome copies in raw untreated wastewater correlated strongly with clinically reported cases by the county, and when used alongside past reported case numbers and temporal information in an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model enabled prediction of new reported cases up to 3 weeks in advance. Taken together, the results show that the high-throughput surveillance could greatly ameliorate comprehensive community prevalence assessments by providing robust, rapid estimates. ImportanceWastewater monitoring has a lot of potential for revealing COVID-19 outbreaks before they happen because the virus is found in the wastewater before people have clinical symptoms. However, application of wastewater-based surveillance has been limited by long processing times specifically at the concentration step. Here we introduce a much faster method of processing the samples, and show that its robustness by demonstrating direct comparisons with existing methods and showing that we can predict cases in San Diego by a week with excellent accuracy, and three weeks with fair accuracy, using city sewage. The automated viral concentration method will greatly alleviate the major bottleneck in wastewater processing by reducing the turnaround time during epidemics.","Karthikeyan, Smruthi; Ronquillo, Nancy; Belda-Ferre, Pedro; Alvarado, Destiny; Javidi, Tara; Longhurst, Christopher A.; Knight, Rob",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.16.20232900v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.20232900,250

Inflammatory mediators, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and mast cells have been hypothesized to mediate the pathogenesis of OLP. COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is marked by cytokine storms in the affected patients. Altered T-cell responses marked by exhaustion of T-cell count with hyperaggressive remaining T-cells and presence of cross-reactive antibodies render infected humans as fertile grounds for development of multisystem disorders. In addition, Vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 patients can further modify the T cell mediated immunity. Increased circulating cytokines and hyperactive CD8+ T cells can alter the oral immune barriers rendering them susceptible to oral disorders. Due to the widespread immune dysregulation, it is possible that patients of COVID-19 may develop OLP in the aftermath or during recovery. The paper explores the pathogenic mechanism behind development OLP as post-COVID condition on account of their target receptor, T-cell responses, cytokine profile, mucosal immune barriers and nutrition deficiency.","Sood, Anubhuti; Raghavan, Sreevatsan; Batra, Puneet; Sharma, Karan; Talwar, Aditya",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987721002000?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34601231/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987721002000; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2021.110681,250

OBJECTIVE: To develop a risk-based strategy for triaging mammograms during periods of decreased capacity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study used data collected prospectively from mammography examinations performed in 2014 to 2019 at 92 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Participants included individuals undergoing mammography. Data were analyzed from August 10 to November 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Clinical indication for screening, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, age, time since last mammogram/screening interval, family history of breast cancer, breast density, and history of high-risk breast lesion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Combinations of clinical indication, clinical history, and breast cancer risk factors that subdivided mammograms into risk groups according to their cancer detection rate were identified using classification and regression trees. RESULTS: The cohort included 898 415 individuals contributing 1 878 924 mammograms (mean [SD] age at mammogram, 58.6 [11.2] years) interpreted by 448 radiologists, with 1 722 820 mammograms in individuals without a personal history of breast cancer and 156 104 mammograms in individuals with a history of breast cancer. Most individuals were aged 50 to 69 years at imaging (1 113 174 mammograms [59.2%]), and 204 305 (11.2%) were Black, 206 087 (11.3%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 126 677 (7.0%) were Hispanic or Latina, and 40 021 (2.2%) were another race/ethnicity or mixed race/ethnicity. Cancer detection rates varied widely based on clinical indication, breast symptoms, personal history of breast cancer, and age. The 12% of mammograms with very high (89.6 [95% CI, 82.3-97.5] to 122.3 [95% CI, 108.1-138.0] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) or high (36.1 [95% CI, 33.1-39.3] to 47.5 [95% CI, 42.4-53.3] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) cancer detection rates accounted for 55% of all detected cancers and included mammograms to evaluate an abnormal mammogram or breast lump in individuals of all ages regardless of breast cancer history, to evaluate breast symptoms other than lump in individuals with a breast cancer history or without a history but aged 60 years or older, and for short-interval follow-up in individuals aged 60 years or older without a breast cancer history. The 44.2% of mammograms with very low cancer detection rates accounted for 13.1% of detected cancers and included annual screening mammograms in individuals aged 50 to 69 years (3.8 [95% CI, 3.5-4.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms) and all screening mammograms in individuals younger than 50 years regardless of screening interval (2.8 [95% CI, 2.6-3.1] cancers detected per 1000 mammograms).

Medium cut-off (MCO) membranes may make greater clearances for large-middle molecules (including cytokines) than low-flux (LF) membranes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of MCO membranes on outcome of COVID-19 patients on hemodialysis (HD). METHODS: Sixty COVID-19 HD patients were included in this study. The patients were categorized into 2 groups regarding type of HD membranes. Clinical data were taken from medical records. RESULTS: Initial crp and ferritin levels, which are surragates of cytokine storm and severity of disease in COVID-19, were significantly higher in MCO membrane group compared to LF group (p = 0.037 and 0.000, respectively). Although there were more patients with severe disease in MCO group, there were no significant differences regarding need for intensive care unit and death. CONCLUSION: It may be an option to use MCO membranes in HD patients with COVID-19 in order to reduce cytokine levels and prevent cytokine storm.","Yalın, Serkan Feyyaz; Altıparmak, Mehmet Rıza; Dincer, Mevlut Tamer; Yadigar, Serap; Murt, Ahmet; Parmaksiz, Ergun; Ronco, Claudio",Blood Purif,https://doi.org/10.1159/000513621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445173/,250
605011,Population subgroup differences in the use of a COVID-19 chatbot,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND Physical activity (PA) interventions can increase PA and improve well-being among adults affected by cancer; however, most adults do not meet cancer-specific PA recommendations. Lack of time, facility access, and travel distances are barriers to participation in PA interventions. eHealth technologies may address some of these barriers, serving as a viable way to promote PA behavior change in this population. However, no review from July 2018 has synthesized available evidence across eHealth and cancer types or examined the use of behavioral theory and behavior change techniques (BCTs), leaving important gaps in knowledge. OBJECTIVE This review aims to provide a comprehensive, updated overview of evidence on eHealth PA interventions for adults with cancer by describing the current state of the literature, exploring associations between intervention characteristics and effectiveness, and identifying future research needs. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SportDiscus, Scopus, and CENTRAL were searched for eHealth PA interventions for adults affected by cancer. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate, with consultation from the senior author (NCR). BCT coding, risk of bias, and completeness of reporting were performed using standardized tools. Results were summarized via narrative synthesis and harvest plots. Weight analyses were conducted to explore the associations between intervention characteristics and effectiveness. RESULTS A total of 71 articles (67 studies) involving 6655 participants (mean age 56.7 years, SD 8.2) were included. Nearly 50% (32/67) of the articles were published after July 2018. Significant postintervention PA increases were noted in 52% (35/67) of the studies, and PA maintenance was noted in 41% (5/12) of the studies that included a follow-up. Study duration, primary objectives, and eHealth modality (eg, websites, activity trackers, and SMS text messaging) varied widely. Social cognitive theory (23/67, 34%) was the most used theory. The mean number of BCTs used across the studies was 13.5 (SD 5.5), with self-monitoring, credible sources, and goal setting being used in >90% of studies. Weight analyses showed the greatest associations between increased PA levels and PA as a primary outcome (0.621), interventions using websites (0.656) or mobile apps (0.563), interventions integrating multiple behavioral theories (0.750), and interventions using BCTs of problem solving (0.657) and action planning (0.645). All studies had concerns with high risk of bias, mostly because of the risk of confounding, measurement bias, and incomplete reporting. CONCLUSIONS A range of eHealth PA interventions may increase PA levels among adults affected by cancer, and specific components (eg, websites, use of theory, and action planning) may be linked to greater effectiveness. However, more work is needed to ascertain and optimize effectiveness, measure long-term effects, and address concerns with bias and incomplete reporting. This evidence is required to support arguments for integrating eHealth within PA promotion in oncology.","Ester, Manuel; Eisele, Maximilian; Wurz, Amanda; McDonough, Meghan H; McNeely, Margaret; Culos-Reed, S Nicole",JMIR cancer,https://doi.org/10.2196/28852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542415/,250

Since the beginning of the outbreak, some individuals were more likely to manifest more severe outcomes. Diabetic patients were of that sort; however, the severity of COVID-19 in prediabetic ones remained less identified. This study aimed to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis of the previously published observational studies investigating the severity of COVID-19 in prediabetic patients. METHODS: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library, and google scholar databases were queried to identify relevant studies concerning prediabetes and serious COVID-19 outcomes. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the likelihood of severe presentations in prediabetic patients. RESULTS: A total of 3027 patients were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used regarding the high heterogeneity (I(2) = 55%). Prediabetes was significantly associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 with an OR of 2.58 (95%CI, 1.46–4.56). CONCLUSION: Prediabetes could act as a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19. Early detection of prediabetic patients might be helpful to adopt preventive and protective strategies to improve the prognosis of the infected individuals.","Heidarpour, Maryam; Abhari, Amir Parsa; Sadeghpour, Niyousha; Shafie, Davood; Sarokhani, Diana",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402121003271?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402121003271,250

Initially, experts predicted that Africa, the poorest continent with the most vulnerable population and health system, would be greatly affected by the ongoing outbreak. However, 240days after the first confirmed case, Africa is among the least affected region, with lower than expected incident cases and mortality. In this review, we discuss possible explanations and reasons for this unexpected low burden of COVID-19 in Africa.

607699,The COVID-19 outbreak: From “black swan” to global challenges and opportunities,2020-04-11,"RATIONALE: Countries worldwide rely on the COVID-19 vaccine to contain the spread of the pandemic. However, because of the inequality in distribution, people in many demographic groups and regions still do not have access to a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. OBJECTIVE: To aid vaccine promotion campaigns that target populations with different access to the COVID-19 vaccine, this study examined how vaccine availability and vaccination intention influence people's consideration of the COVID-19 vaccine. METHOD: We conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey and choice-based conjoint experiment to examine the influence of vaccine availability and vaccination intention on perceived barriers of vaccination (e.g., safety and cost concern) and preference in different vaccine features (e.g., FDA approval status and number of doses administered). RESULT: We found that low availability and intention increased attention to global behavioral barriers such as safety concern and high-level vaccine attributes such as efficacy. In contrast, high availability articulates practical considerations such as cost and logistics associated with vaccination. CONCLUSION: Based on such findings, we conclude that health communicators need to strategically customize their messages based on audience access to the COVID-19 vaccine and their intention to get vaccinated. Highlighting the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine may be more effective in low-accessibility and low-intention groups, while emphasis on practical considerations such as vaccine cost and logistics may be more effective in high-accessibility and high-intention groups.","Chu, Haoran; Liu, Sixiao",Soc Sci Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34419632/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114315; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S027795362100647X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362100647X?v=s5,250

610254,Analysis and prediction of COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa,2021-01-28,"The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and its metabolites play an important role in homeostasis of body, especially the cardiovascular system. In this study, we discuss the imbalance of multiple systems during the infection and the importance of therapeutic choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of cardiac and anti-coagulant therapies in COVID-19 patients. The crosstalk between angiotensin, kinin-kallikrein system, as well as inflammatory and coagulation systems plays an essential role in COVID-19. Cardiac complications and coagulopathies imply the crosstalks between the mentioned systems. We believe that the blockage of bradykinin can be a good option in the management of COVID-19 and CVD in patients and that supportive treatment of respiratory and cardiologic complications is needed in COVID-19 patients. Ninety-one percent of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to hospital with a prolonged aPTT were positive for lupus anticoagulant, which increases the risk of thrombosis and prolonged aPTT. Therefore, the question that is posed at this juncture is whether it is safe to use the prophylactic dose of heparin particularly in those with elevated D‐dimer levels. It should be noted that timing is of high importance in anti-coagulant therapy; therefore, we should consider the level of D-dimer, fibrinogen, drug-drug interactions, and risk factors during thromboprophylaxis administration. Fibrinogen is an independent predictor of resistance to heparin and should be considered before thromboprophylaxis. Alteplase and Futhan might be a good choice to assess the condition of heparin resistance. Finally, the treatment option, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant therapy are critical decisions in COVID-19 patients.","Haybar, Habib; Maniati, Mahmood; Saki, Najmaldin; Zayeri, Zeinab Deris",Mol Biol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06333-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837899/,250

Analyzing 14-years of data with multilevel mixed-effects models, we found higher levels of loneliness among people living alone, people more socially isolated, and people with less perceived support. Gender affected changes in loneliness, controlling for social isolation, perceived support, living arrangements, age, education, income, health, and marital status. Women, whether living alone or with others, experienced increases in loneliness; women living alone reported the greatest increase in loneliness. Men living alone reported high levels of loneliness prior to the pandemic, but only a slight increase over time. These analyses, which demonstrate that loneliness changed at the onset of the pandemic as a function of gender and living arrangement identify older people most likely to benefit from intervention.","Wilson-Genderson, Maureen; Heid, Allison R; Cartwright, Francine; Collins, Amy L; Pruchno, Rachel",Research on aging,https://doi.org/10.1177/01640275211026649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344251/,250

This study investigated the role played by self-regulated learning strategies in predicting procrastination among university students. To this purpose, the relationships of procrastination with cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies and time management were explored in the entire sample, as well as in male and female groups. Gender differences were taken into account due to the mixed results that emerged in previous studies. This cross-sectional study involved 450 university students (M = 230; F = 220; Mage = 21.08, DS = 3.25) who completed a self-reported questionnaire including a sociodemographic section, the Tuckman Procrastination Scale, the Time Management Scale, and the Metacognitive Self-Regulation and Critical Thinking Scales. Descriptive and inferential analyses were applied to the data. The main findings indicated that temporal and metacognitive components play an important role in students’ academic achievement and that, compared to females, males procrastinate more due to poor time management skills and metacognitive strategies.

Despite the frequent use of ultrasound, inadvertent placement of CVC into the carotid artery is still possible. It carries significant morbidity due to the incidence of bleeding, arteriovenous fistula, and stroke. Methods: We present a case of accidental placement of CVC into the right carotid artery, which led to the right-sided temporoparietal stroke. Case Summary: A 71-year-old male was admitted to hospital with symptoms of cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-19 and did require mechanical ventilation due to progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient developed distributive shock and underwent CVC placement at the day of admission. On the 24th day of intubation, the patient was unable to move his left upper and lower extremities. Computed tomography (CT) head revealed showed a large temporoparietal stroke. CT Angiogram of head and neck revealed a misplaced CVC within the right common carotid artery . He was transferred to the Neuro ICU at our hospital where the patient underwent catheter removal and carotid artery sheath placement followed by dual antiplatelet therapy. Although the patient survived, he still required long-term facility placement due to the stroke. Conclusion: We reiterate that an experienced clinician must perform the CVC placement with ultrasound guidance and verify its placement with multiple confirmation techniques afterwards. Providers must manage unintentional carotid artery placement promptly to prevent long-term sequelae associated with it.","Tanveer Ud Din, Mian; Nasrullah, Adeel; Sarma, Deeksha; Ashraf, Obaid; Arshad, Hammad",Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2021.1952015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567466/,250

A small proportion of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 required admission to a PICU. We describe the nationwide U.K. PICU experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection during the first wave of the pandemic and compare this with the critical care course of the 2019 influenza cohort. DESIGN: Prospective nationwide cohort study of characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2–positive children. Data collection utilized routine Pediatric Intensive Care Audit Network and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2–specific data. SETTING: All U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children less than 18 years old, admitted to U.K. PICUs between March 14, 2020, and June 13, 2020, and a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction. Children admitted to U.K. PICUs in 2019 with influenza provided comparison. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 76 PICU admissions among 73 children with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Prevalence of PICU admissions per million was 5.2 for children versus 260 for adults. Ten children (14%) were identified on routine screening. Seventeen children (23%) had pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Seventeen (23%) had coinfections. Invasive ventilation was required in seven of 17 children (41%) with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 versus 38 of 56 other severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 positive children (68%), with 77% requiring vasoactive support versus 43%, respectively. Seven children (10%) died. In comparison with influenza children, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 children were older (median [interquartile range]: 10 [1–13] vs 3 yr [1–8 yr]), more often Black or Asian (52% v 18%), higher weight z score (0.29 [–0.80 to 1.62] vs –0.41 [–1.37 to 0.63]), and higher deprivation index (3.3 [–1 to 6.3] vs 1.2 [–1.8 to 4.4]). Comorbidities, frequency of organ supports, and length of stay were similar. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study confirms that PICU admissions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infections were infrequent.

615099,Impact of Bias in Data Collection of COVID-19 Cases,2021,"BACKGROUND: In efforts to help alleviate the strain placed on healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, The American Society of Plastic Surgery (ASPS) recommended suspending elective procedures on March 19, 2020. When this suspension was enacted, it was unknown when cases would resume. OBJECTIVES: This analysis aims to estimate the regional economic impact of the pandemic specifically with regards to elective, aesthetic surgical procedures. As knowledge regarding the effects of the pandemic has grown, the authors then evaluated the accuracy of our projected estimates when compared to actual events. METHODS: Using the ASPS 2018 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report, regional case volume and surgeons’ fees were obtained for the top five aesthetic procedures. Models developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) were used to estimate the anticipated duration of suspension by using the date that no ventilators would be required to for COVID-19 patients. This duration was used to calculate the volume of cases that would not occur. RESULTS: These estimates predict up to 1.3 billion fewer dollars will be collected in surgeons’ fees, representing a 20% loss compared to 2018. The South Atlantic region is predicted to have the greatest number of OR days lost; However, the Mountain and Pacific regions are estimated to have the greatest loss in case volume and surgeons’ fees.

The SARS-CoV-2 double gene RT-PCR kit targeting the SARS-CoV-2 specific N (nucleocapsid) and Orf1ab gene regions was used for RNA amplification. The human RNaseP gene was used for nucleic acid extraction and inhibition control. The shape of the growth curves was examined and the non-sigmoidal curves were recorded as ""negative"". Sigmoidal curves with cycle threshold (Ct) <38 were evaluated as ""positive"". The Ct values of all positive results were recorded. V-Chek RAD test kit uses a colloidal gold enhanced double antibody sandwich type antigen test kit. A SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen produces a distinct color band in the test region, formed by the specific antibody-antigen colored conjugate complex. A positive or negative result is indicated by a colored line appearance on the test region. A colored line appears in the control region, independent of the SARS-CoV-2 presence. The result is visually read 10 minutes after the last drop of the sample liquid is dispensed into the sample well. Specificity and sensitivity values were calculated accepting the RT-PCR results as a standard. Agreement between two different techniques was assessed using Cohen's kappa score. 110 patients were enrolled in this study; 34 (30.9 %) of these patients had positive RT-PCR samples, with the mean of Ct values of 25.8 (95% CI= 24.1-27.5), median of Ct values of 26. In our study population, the overall sensitivity was 61.8% (95% CI= 45.4-78.1), and specificity was 100%. Taking RT-PCR as reference, Cohen's kappa score for the antigen test was 0.691. Fisher's exact test was p<0.001. In conclusion, the RAD kit used in the study determined to be useful for the rapid identification of COVID-19 patients. However, a negative result does not eliminate the possibility of COVID-19 infection and should be confirmed by RT-PCR and clinical findings.","Kipritci, Zehra; Keskin, Ali Ümit; Çiragil, Pinar; Topkaya, Aynur Eren",Mikrobiyol Bul,https://doi.org/10.5578/mb.20219815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34416811/,250
616888,Superspreaders and lockdown timing explain the power law dynamics of COVID-19,2020-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Routine asymptomatic testing using RT-PCR of people who interact with vulnerable populations, such as medical staff in hospitals or care workers in care homes, has been employed to help prevent outbreaks among vulnerable populations. Although the peak sensitivity of RT-PCR can be high, the probability of detecting an infection will vary throughout the course of an infection. The effectiveness of routine asymptomatic testing will therefore depend on testing frequency and how PCR detection varies over time. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian statistical model to a dataset of twice weekly PCR tests of UK healthcare workers performed by self-administered nasopharyngeal swab, regardless of symptoms. We jointly estimated times of infection and the probability of a positive PCR test over time following infection; we then compared asymptomatic testing strategies by calculating the probability that a symptomatic infection is detected before symptom onset and the probability that an asymptomatic infection is detected within 7 days of infection. RESULTS: We estimated that the probability that the PCR test detected infection peaked at 77% (54–88%) 4 days after infection, decreasing to 50% (38–65%) by 10 days after infection. Our results suggest a substantially higher probability of detecting infections 1–3 days after infection than previously published estimates. We estimated that testing every other day would detect 57% (33–76%) of symptomatic cases prior to onset and 94% (75–99%) of asymptomatic cases within 7 days if test results were returned within a day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that routine asymptomatic testing can enable detection of a high proportion of infected individuals early in their infection, provided that the testing is frequent and the time from testing to notification of results is sufficiently fast.

617009,Sentiment Informed Timeseries Analyzing AI (SITALA) to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Houston,2020-07-24,"Successful implementation and use of learning management systems (LMSs) have become a critical challenge for many higher education institutes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although LMSs with lots of features were developed for universities, the success of those systems is highly related to a detailed understanding of challenges and factors influencing the use of the systems among their users. HELMS (Higher Education Learning Management System) is a countrywide LMS used for teaching and learning during the quarantine period caused by covid-19 in Afghanistan universities. As it was the first experience of Afghan universities in using the learning management systems during the pandemic, challenges were expected to appear. No previous research has been conducted on either studying the challenges of using the HELMS or investigating the factors influencing the use of HELMS during the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan. Hence, there was no unified view of the potential challenges of using HELMS and factors influencing the use of the HELMS among the researchers. This research aims to investigate the challenges that face the use of HELMS and explore the factors influencing the use of HELMS among both lecturers and students. This study employed a qualitative research method by conducting semi-structured interviews with 100 participants including university management, lecturers, and students. Thematic analysis was used as a method for the analysis of qualitative data. The findings of this research will help policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in public and private universities to grasp knowledge on the successful implementation and use of LMSs during covid-19 and afterward.","Mohammadi, Mustafa Kamel; Mohibbi, Abdul Aziz; Hedayati, Mohammad Hadi",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841030/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10517-z,250

Different countries have tried to control its spread by applying the basic principles of social distancing and testing. Healthcare professionals have been the frontline workers globally with different opinions regarding the preparation and management of this pandemic. We aim to get the opinion of Healthcare professionals in United Kingdom regarding their perceptions of preparedness in their workplace and general views of current pandemic management strategy. METHOD: A questionnaire survey, drafted using Google Forms, was distributed among Healthcare professionals working in the National Health Service (NHS) across the United Kingdom. The study was kept open for the first 2 weeks of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1007 responses were obtained with majority of the responses from England (n=850, 84.40 %). There were 670 (66.53%) responses from doctors and 204 (20.26%) from nurses. Most of the respondents (95.23%) had direct patient contact in day to day activity. Only one third of the respondents agreed that they felt supported at their trust and half of the respondents reported that adequate training was provided to the frontline staff. Two-thirds of the respondents were of the view that there was not enough Personal Protective Equipment available while 80% thought that this pandemic has improved their hand washing practice. Most of the respondents were in the favour of an earlier lockdown (90%) and testing all the NHS frontline staff (94%). CONCLUSION: Despite current efforts, it would seem this is not translating to a sense of security amongst the UK NHS workforce in terms of how they feel trained and protected. It is vital that Healthcare professionals have adequate support and protection at their workplace and that these aspects be actively monitored.","Iqbal, Muhammad Rafaih; Chaudhuri, Arindam",Int J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447002/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919120304258?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.05.042; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919120304258,250

The COVID-19 pandemic is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus, namely, the new and emerging SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. In the present work, we present simulations of the initial outbreak of this new coronavirus using a modified transmission rate SEIR model that takes into account the impact of government actions and the perception of risk by individuals in reaction to the proportion of fatal cases. The parameters related to these effects were fitted to the number of infected cases in the 33 provinces of China. The data for Hubei Province, the probable site of origin of the current pandemic, were considered as a particular case for the simulation and showed that the theoretical model reproduces the behavior of the data, thus indicating the importance of combining government actions and individual risk perceptions when the proportion of fatal cases is greater than [Formula: see text] . The results show that the adjusted model reproduces the behavior of the data quite well for some provinces, suggesting that the spread of the disease differs when different actions are evaluated.

The disease usually causes respiratory symptoms but in a small proportion of patients can lead to pneumonitis, Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome and death. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) is considered a life-saving treatment for COVID19 patients and a huge demand for IMV devices was reported globally. This review aims to provide insight into the initial IMV practices for COVID19 patients in the initial phase of the pandemic. Methods: Electronic databases (Embase and MEDLINE) were searched for applicable articles using relevant keywords. The references of included articles were hand searched. Articles that reported the use of IMV in adult COVID19 patients were included in the review. The NIH quality assessment tool for cohort and cross-sectional studies was used to appraise studies. Results: 106 abstracts were identified from the databases search, of which 16 were included. 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In total, 9988 patients were included across all studies. The overall cases of COVID-19 requiring IMV ranged from 2-77%. Increased age and pre-existing comorbidities increased the likelihood of IMV requirement. The reported mortality rate in patients receiving IMV ranged between 50-100%. On average, IMV was required and initiated between 10-17 days from symptoms onset. When ventilated, COVID19 patients required IMV for a median of 10-17 days across studies. Little information was provided on ventilatory protocols or management strategies. Conclusion: In these initial reporting studies for the first month of the pandemic, patients receiving IMV were older and had more pre-existing co-morbidities than those who did not require IMV. The mortality rate was high in COVID19 patients who received IMV. Studies are needed to evaluate protocols and modalities of IMV to improve outcomes and identify the populations most likely to benefit from IMV.","Almeshari, M. A.; Alobaidi, N.

This study sought to assess COVID-19-related fear, depression, anxiety and stress among hospital staff, potential factors that may help reduce its psychological effects and their personal coping strategies. The study will help to highlight the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Ghanaian health workers and indirectly serve as a needs assessment survey for input to support affected staff and the broader health system. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among health workers in three hospitals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana from 11 July 2020 to 12 August 2020. Demographic data and scores from the validated DASS-21 and Fear of COVID-19 scales and two other scales developed de novo were entered from 272 self-administered questionnaires and analyzed for means, frequencies and proportions. Fisher’s exact test analysis was done to ascertain associations between selected independent variables and depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare the mean and median scores of the outcome variables across the three study hospitals. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Over 40% of respondents had fear while 21.1%, 27.8% and 8.2% had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Positive attitudes from colleagues and the government’s tax-free salary relief were some factors said to reduce the psychological effects while over half of participants indicated praying more often as a coping strategy. There is a need for the health system to recognize the presence of these adverse psychological effects in health workers and take pragmatic steps to address them.","Ofori, Anthony Amanfo; Osarfo, Joseph; Agbeno, Evans Kofi; Manu, Dominic Owusu; Amoah, Elsie",SAGE Open Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211000919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786183/,250

While the antiviral properties of type 1 interferon (IFN-I) are undeniable, recent studies have reported expanding and somewhat unexpected roles of IFN-I signaling during both acute and persistent viral infections. IFN-I signaling can promote morbidity and mortality through induction of aberrant inflammatory responses and recruitment of inflammatory innate immune cell populations during acute respiratory viral infections. During persistent viral infection, IFN-I signaling promotes containment of early viral replication/dissemination, however, also initiates and maintains immune suppression, lymphoid tissue disorganization, and CD4 T cell dysfunction through modulation of multiple immune cell populations. Finally, new data are emerging illuminating how specific IFN-I species regulate immune pathology and suppression during acute and persistent viral infections, respectively. Systematic characterization of the cellular populations that produce IFN-I, how the timing of IFN-I induction and intricacies of subtype specific IFN-I signaling promote pathology or immune suppression during acute and persistent viral infections should inform the development of treatments and modalities to control viral associated pathologies.","Teijaro, J.R.",Adv Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769506/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277616300372; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ai.2016.08.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277616300372,250

This study aimed to investigate the distinctive CT characteristics of two stages of the disease (progression and remission). METHODS: We included all COVID‐19 patients admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Patients underwent multiple chest CT scans at intervals of 3–10 days. CT features were recorded, such as the lesion lobe, distribution characteristics (subpleural, scattered, or diffused), shape of the lesion, maximum size of the lesion, lesion morphology (ground‐glass opacity, GGO), and consolidation features. When consolidation was positive, the boundary was identified to determine its clarity. RESULTS: The ratios of some representative features differed between the remission stage and the progression phase, such as round‐shape lesion (8.0% vs. 34.4%), GGO (65.0% vs. 87.5%), consolidation (62.0% vs. 31.3%), large cable sign (59.0% vs. 9.4%), and crazy‐paving sign (20.0% vs. 50.0%). Using these features, we pooled all the CT data (n = 132) and established a logistic regression model to predict the current development stage. The variables consolidation, boundary feature, large cable sign, and crazy‐paving sign were the most significant factors, based on a variable named ‘prediction of progression or remission’ (PPR) that we constructed. The ROC curve showed that PPR had an AUC of 0.882 (cutoff value = 0.66, sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.875). CONCLUSION: CT characteristics, in particular, round shape, GGO, consolidation, large cable sign, and crazy‐paving sign, may increase the recognition of the intrapulmonary development of COVID‐19.","Liao, Jie‐lan; Chen, Yu; Huang, Chong‐quan; He, Gui‐qing; Du, Ji‐cheng; Chen, Que‐lu",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068310/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13760,250

Children have been noted to have less severe illness than adults and may have less transmission potential. We sought to determine whether children deemed to be asymptomatic had a difference in the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of respiratory samples from symptomatic children with SARS CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study to compare PCR Ct values of 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory samples collected over a 4-month period. The study was a single center review of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a respiratory specimen at a large tertiary care children’s hospital. Inclusion criteria included children 0–18 years of age who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a respiratory specimen for whom clinical information was available in the electronic medical record. RESULTS: We analyzed 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from a respiratory sample over a 4-month period and for whom data was available in the electronic medical record. Overall, 71.2% of infected children were symptomatic. The mean Ct value for symptomatic patients (Ct mean 19.9, SD 6.3) was significantly lower than asymptomatic patients (Ct mean 23.5, SD 6.5) (P value < 0.001, CI(95th) 2.6 - 4.6). The mean PCR Ct value was lowest in children less than 5 years of age.

623630,How to optimize the Radiology protocol during the global COVID-19 epidemic: Keypoints from Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital,2020-08-05,"The emergence of Covid-19 has caused a pandemic and is a major public health concern. Covid-19 has fundamentally challenged the global health care system in all aspects. However, there is a growing concern for the subsequent detrimental effects of continuing delays or adjustments on time-dependent treatments for Covid-19 negative patients. Patients arriving to the ED with STEMIs and acute CVA are currently presumed to have delays due to Covid-19 related concerns. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on non-Covid19 patients in emergency care settings. We conducted a retrospective study from February 2020 to April 2020 and compared this to a parallel period in 2019 to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on three distinct non-Covid-19 ED diagnosis that require immediate intervention. Our primary outcome measures were time to primary PCI in acute STEMI, time to fibrinolysis in acute CVA, and time to femoral hip fracture correction surgery. Our secondary outcome measure included a composite outcome of length of stay in hospital and mortality. From 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, the total referrals to ED diagnosed with STEMI, Hip fracture and CVA of which required intervention were 197 within Covid-19 group 2020 compared to 250 in the control group 2019. Mean duration to intervention (PCI, surgery and tPA, respectively) did not differ between COVID-19 group and 2019 group. Among femoral hip fracture patients', the referral numbers to ED were significantly lower in Covid-19 era (p = 0.040) and the hospitalization stay was significantly shorter (p = 0.003). Among CVA patients', we found statistical differences among the number of referrals and the patients' age. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic presents a challenge for the general healthcare system. Our results suggest that with proper management, despite the obstacles of isolation policies and social distancing, any negative impact on the quality of health care for the non-Covid-19 patients can be minimized in the emergency department setting.","Ben-Haim, Gal; Zabatani, Amit; Orion, David; Leshem, Eyal; Irony, Avinoah; Katorza, Eldad",Intern Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02680-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650082/,250

This study examined associations between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, fear of infection, and protection self-efficacy. METHODS: Adults either residing, having employment, or receiving health care in Arkansas (n = 754) participated in an online survey between October 30, 2020 and January 16, 2021. Participants were recruited in both rural and urban areas from 6 Arkansas primary care clinics. Survey questions addressed sociodemographic factors, COVID-19 infection fear, protection self-efficacy, and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess associations between dependent variables and respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 infection fear, and COVID-19 protection self-efficacy. RESULTS: About 38% of participants reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Age, sex, race, and education were significantly associated with COVID-19 and general vaccine attitudes. Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreased as age increased (OR = 0.98; P < .01). Women had higher odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy than men (OR = 1.52; P < .05). Respondents with a high school diploma and below and respondents with some college or a technical degree had greater odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (OR = 2.58; P < .001; and OR = 1.97; P < .01, respectively) compared to respondents with a 4-year college degree. Black/African American respondents had greater odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy compared to White respondents (OR = 3.08; P < .001). No significant difference was observed among rural and urban respondents regarding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; however, respondents in rural areas were more likely to report low general vaccine trust compared to those in urban areas (OR = 1.87; P < .01). Respondents reporting no fear (OR = 5.51; P < .001) and very little fear (OR = 1.95; P < .05) of COVID-19 had greater odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy compared to respondents who feared COVID-19 infection to a great extent. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and general trust in vaccines differ significantly among age, sex, race, and education. These trust and hesitancy patterns are challenges for achieving population immunity and follow similar patterns of vulnerability to COVID-19. Vaccination programs and interventions must consider these differences in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and general vaccine trust to alleviate COVID-19 disparities. Findings make a significant contribution in evaluating vaccine hesitancy among a large, diverse sample from a rural state.","McElfish, Pearl A.; Willis, Don E.; Shah, Sumit K.; Bryant-Moore, Keneshia; Rojo, Martha O.; Selig, James P.",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211040746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34427126/,250
625164,COVID-19-induced shocks and uncertainty(),2021-09-09,"Abstract Objectives The January 2020 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to ‘self-isolate’ if they have potentially come into contact with the infection. However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design Rapid evidence review. Methods We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","Webster, Rebecca K.; Brooks, Samantha K.; Smith, Louise E.; Woodland, Lisa; Wessely, Simon; Rubin, G.

These technologies hold a number of fundamental challenges and ethical concerns that need addressing to aid the success of this fast-growing field. In particular, the responsible development of such technologies requires caregiver input. We conducted a survey of the opinions of 410 caregivers on the viability, privacy and data access of remote in-home monitoring technologies and study designs. Infant-friendly wearable devices (such as sensing body suits) were viewed favourably. Caregivers were marginally more likely to accept video and audio recording in the home if data was anonymised (through automated processing) at point of collection, particularly when observations were lengthy. Caregivers were more open to international data sharing for anonymous data. Caregivers were interested in viewing all types of data, but were particularly keen to access video and audio recordings for censoring purposes (i.e., to delete data segments). Taken together, our results indicate generally positive attitudes to remote in-home monitoring technologies and studies for infant research but highlight specific considerations such as safety, privacy and family practicalities (e.g. multiple caregivers, visitors and varying schedules) that must be taken into account when developing future studies.","Fish, Laurel A.; Jones, Emily J.

From the earliest months, it became increasingly clear that in addition to affecting the upper airways and lungs, there were other organs that could be affected. Among these, the skin became a real “sentinel signal” to be able to even suspect COVID-19. Background: this study deals with a little-explored issue for now: the study of skin immunopathology in SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects ascertained using the most reliable methods available. Methods: we used skin biopsy samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients, studying morphology (Hematoxylin-Eosin), T lymphocyte population (CD4 and CD8), three markers such as HMGB-1, TIM-3 and HO-1 by immunohistochemistry. Results: although the presence of the CD4 and CD8 T population did not differ statistically significantly, we found greater activation and release of HMGB-1 in skin samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, greater immunolabeling for TIM-3 at the level of CD4 and CD8 and a reduced expression of Heme oxygenase 1. Conclusions: these results support the possibility that there is immune deregulation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who develop skin manifestations of various kinds.","Cazzato, Gerardo; Colagrande, Anna; Cimmino, Antonietta; Cicco, Gerolamo; Scarcella, Vincenza Sara; Tarantino, Paola; Lospalluti, Lucia; Romita, Paolo; Foti, Caterina; Demarco, Aurora; Sablone, Sara; Candance, Pragnell Maria Victoria; Cicco, Sebastiano; Lettini, Teresa; Ingravallo, Giuseppe; Resta, Leonardo",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439887/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081219,250

Methods: A cross-sectional study of the general Greek population (N = 1858) was conducted. A geographically stratified cluster sampling was implemented. A questionnaire was composed consisting of 35 questions. Data collection took place from 15 April to 2 May 2020. A random-digit dialing survey was conducted by 29 interviewers. Results: The majority of respondents (62.7%) answered ≥12/17 questions correctly. Participants aged 18–44 years, male gender, specific occupations (freelancer, unemployed, housewife, retiree) and those who sought information about COVID-19 from less than two sources received lower aggregated scores on knowledge questions. Regarding attitudes toward future vaccination, 18.9% declared that were against it, while 81.1% that they may consider or will be vaccinated. About 40% were not using a face mask and only 42% washed their hands appropriately. Conclusion: Adjusting information campaigns targeting especially people below 45 years of age can help to sensitize them and realise their role to control the spread. Further targeted surveys are needed to adjust/design prevention campaigns.","Mouchtouri, Varvara A.; Agathagelidou, Evagelia; Kofonikolas, Kleovoulos; Rousou, Xanthi; Dadouli, Katerina; Pinaka, Ourania; Agathocleous, Evi; Anagnostopoulou, Lemonia; Chatziligou, Chrysanthi; Christoforidou, Eleni P.; Chalntoupi, Thekla; Kalomoiris, Loukas; Kapoula, Christina; Kokkinou, Vasiliki; Constantinides, Aggeliki; Konstantinou, Petros; Kostara, Elina; Kourentis, Leonidas; Lantou, Anastasia; Lempidakis, Georgios; Liasidi, Polixeni-Natalia; Michalakis, Christos; Panagiotou, Dorothea; Panteliadou, Freideriki; Papadoulis, Vasileios; Papantoniou, Grigorios; Psatha, Maria; Ragias, Dimitrios; Ringa, Vera; Syrakouli, Argyro; Skoutari, Angeliki; Stergiadou, Stella; Theodorou, Andreas; Tzika, Vasiliki; Lagiou, Areti; Dardavesis, Theodoros; Prezerakos, Panagiotis; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17238854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260789/,250

The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in patients with CLL in 1 year was approximately 3% in the recent Italian CAMPUS CLL survey; large retrospective studies have documented a higher mortality in patients with CLL hospitalized for severe COVID-19 compared with the general population. Controversial results for CLL-directed treatment have been reported, with some studies suggesting a potential benefit for BTK inhibitors. Reducing the number of hospital visits, delaying treatment whenever possible, and using oral therapy have become the mainstay of management in these patients. Available results with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines indicate an immune serological response in 40% of patients only, with a detrimental effect of recent therapy with or without anti-CD20 therapy, older age, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Further studies are needed to determine the best strategies in patients with CLL regarding (i) management of concomitant COVID-19, (ii) identification of patients in whom CLL therapy can be safely postponed, (iii) CLL treatment algorithms, and (iv) optimal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination strategies.","Chatzikonstantinou, Thomas; Herishanu, Yair; Montserrat, Emili; Ghia, Paolo; Cuneo, Antonio; Foà, Robin; Scarfò, Lydia",Cancer journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0000000000000535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398560/,250

Although direct infection of the central nervous system is uncertain or very rare and the para-infectious complications (e.g. inflammatory neuropathies) are rare, delirium and septic encephalopathy are common in severely ill patients. Smell dysfunction and headache are very common in mild cases, especially in younger people and females. Muscle pain is common in both mild and severe cases, and in the most compromised patients, it is accompanied by increased creatine kinase levels and by a likely true myopathic damage. Ischemic stroke has been reported as a possible complication of the hypercoagulability associated with severe SARS-Cov-2 infection, but further studies are needed. Most of the neurological manifestations may occur early in the illness. Therefore, during the pandemic period, neurologists need to be involved, alert, and prepared.

Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organization’s Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media. RESULTS: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts, and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply, whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and attracted more public engagement online. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media. It is urgent to develop an effective vaccine campaign that boosts public confidence and addresses hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.","Hou, Zhiyuan; Tong, Yixin; Du, Fanxing; Lu, Linyao; Zhao, Sihong; Yu, Kexin; Piatek, Simon J; Larson, Heidi J; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061757/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27632,250

Methods : OHDSI has created an international federated data source of electronic health records and administrative claims that covers nearly 10% of the world’s population. Using a common data model with a practical schema and extensive vocabulary mappings, data from around the world follow the identical format. OHDSI’s research methods emphasize reproducibility, with a large-scale approach to addressing confounding using propensity score adjustment with extensive diagnostics; negative and positive control hypotheses to test for residual systematic error; a variety of data sources to assess consistency and generalizability; a completely open approach including protocol, software, models, parameters, and raw results so that studies can be externally verified; and the study of many hypotheses in parallel so that the operating characteristics of the methods can be assessed. Results : OHDSI has already produced findings in areas like hypertension treatment that are being incorporated into practice, and it has produced rigorous studies of COVID-19 that have aided government agencies in their treatment decisions, that have characterized the disease extensively, that have estimated the comparative effects of treatments, and that the predict likelihood of advancing to serious complications.

Our data identified several aberrantly expressed mRNA and lncRNA based biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity, which in turn significantly affected canonical, upstream, and disease functions in each group of patients. Immune, interferon, and antiviral responses were severely suppressed in COVID-19 admitted to ICU versus COVID-19 who were not admitted to ICU.

The first hypothesis posited that using place-specific names associated with China (e.g., Wuhan Virus or China Virus) leads to greater levels of sinophobia, the negative stigmatization of Chinese individuals. The second hypothesis posited that using a scientific name (e.g., Coronavirus or COVID-19) leads to increased anxiety, risk aversion, beliefs about contagiousness of the virus, and beliefs about mortality rate. Results from two preregistered studies [N((Study 1)) = 504; N((Study 2)) = 412], conducted across three countries with the first study during the early outbreak (April 2020) and the second study at a later stage of the pandemic (August 2020), found no evidence of any adverse effects of naming on sinophobia and strong support for the null hypothesis using Bayesian analyses. Moreover, analyses found no impact of naming on anxiety, risk aversion, beliefs about contagiousness of the virus, or beliefs about mortality rate, with mild to strong support for the null hypothesis across outcomes. Exploratory analyses also found no evidence for the effect of naming being moderated by political affiliation. In conclusion, results provide no evidence that virus naming impacted individual’s attitudes toward Chinese individuals or perceptions of the virus, with the majority of analyses finding strong support for the null hypothesis. Therefore, based on the current evidence, it appears that the importance given to naming infectious diseases might be inflated.","Masters-Waage, Theodore C.; Jha, Nilotpal; Reb, Jochen",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.561270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362626/,250

We sought to determine the role of autophagy in human BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) infection. The addition excess amino acids during viral infection reduced BKPyV infection. Perturbing autophagy levels using inhibitors, 3-MA, bafilomycin A1, and spautin-1, also reduced infection, while rapamycin treatment of host cells increased infection. siRNA knockdown of autophagy genes, ATG7 and Beclin-1, corresponded to a decrease in BKPyV infection. BKPyV infection not only correlated with autophagosome formation, but also virus particles localized to autophagy-specific compartments early in infection. These data support a novel role for autophagy in the promotion of BKPyV infection.","Bouley, Stephanie J.; Maginnis, Melissa S.; Derdowski, Aaron; Gee, Gretchen V.; O׳Hara, Bethany A.; Nelson, Christian D.; Bara, Anne M.; Atwood, Walter J.; Dugan, Aisling S.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889228/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214000919; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.03.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214000919,250

The majority of CD4+ T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected CNS in the course of the infection are primed cells that neither proliferate ex vivo nor can be stimulated to proliferation by viral antigens or mitogen in vitro. In contrast, T lymphocytes taken from CLNs of the same animals revealed a strong proliferative response. Restimulation of CLN lymphocytes by viral antigens disclosed a striking difference between the disease-resistant rat strain Brown Norway (BN) and the susceptible Lewis (LEW) strain. Whereas BN lymphocytes responded as early as 5 days post infection, it took more than 11 days until a comparable proliferation was detectable in LEW lymphocytes. From these data we postulate that the majority of T lymphocytes entering the virus-infected brain after sensitisation and expansion in cervical lymph nodes is unresponsive to further proliferation signals and that the kinetics and magnitude of T lymphocyte stimulation in CLNs play an important role in the clinical course of the infection.","Imrich, H.; Schwender, S.; Hein, A.; Dörries, R.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7914212/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165572894900663; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165572894900663,250

This process starts with the binding of the spike extramembrane domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane receptor highly abundant in the lungs. In this study, the extramembrane domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (sSpike) was injected on model membranes formed by supported lipid bilayers in presence and absence of the soluble part of receptor ACE2 (sACE2), and the structural features were studied at sub-nanometer level by neutron reflection. In all cases the presence of the protein produced a remarkable degradation of the lipid bilayer. Indeed, both for membranes from synthetic and natural lipids, a significant reduction of the surface coverage was observed. Quartz crystal microbalance measurements showed that lipid extraction starts immediately after sSpike protein injection. All measurements indicate that the presence of proteins induces the removal of membrane lipids, both in the presence and in the absence of ACE2, suggesting that sSpike molecules strongly associate with lipids, and strip them away from the bilayer, via a non-specific interaction. A cooperative effect of sACE2 and sSpike on lipid extraction was also observed.","Luchini, Alessandra; Micciulla, Samantha; Corucci, Giacomo; Batchu, Krishna Chaithanya; Santamaria, Andreas; Laux, Valerie; Darwish, Tamim; Russell, Robert A.; Thepaut, Michel; Bally, Isabelle; Fieschi, Franck; Fragneto, Giovanna",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34290262/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93996-x,250

This study addresses the problem where a dominant airline dynamically sets prices to sell its capacities within a two-phase sales period with only partial information. That partial information may show as the moments (upper and lower bounds and mean) and the median of the demand distribution. We model the problem of dynamic pricing as a distributional robust stochastic programming, which minimizes the expected regret value under the worst-case distribution in the presence of partial information. We further reformulate the proposed non-convex model to show that the closed-form formulae of the second-stage maximal expected regret are well-structured. We also design an efficient algorithm to characterize robust pricing strategies in a polynomial-sized running time. Using numerical analysis, we present several useful managerial insights for airline managers to strategically collect demand information and make prices for their capacities in different market situations. Moreover, we verify that additional information will not compromise the viability of the pricing strategies being implemented.

The Society of Behavioral Medicine urges Congress to authorize increased funding to rural healthcare facilities and staffing, along with the development of enhanced broadband Internet infrastructure. In addition, incentivizing rural healthcare systems to deliver value-based care could enhance their capacity to implement population health and behavioral health strategies. To stem the spread of COVID-19 in higher-risk rural-based industries (e.g., food processing plants), SBM urges Congress to require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to routinely inspect for and enforce COVID-19 mitigation procedures, such as provision of effective Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to all front-line workers and consistent implementation of standardized testing and social distancing advisories.

Countries all over the world have been forced to enforce nationwide lockdowns to curb the transmission of this illness, affecting millions of people. The disorder and the lockdowns enforced have resulted in a complex set of psychosocial stressors in the lives of people, affecting their resilience and causing psychological stress and mental health issues. In this case series, we aim to highlight the role of such psychosocial stressors in causing mental health problems, especially in a vulnerable individual. The first case reports the onset of first-episode mania in a healthy individual with a family history of mental illness, after the sudden demise of the patient’s mother due to COVID-19. The second case highlights the onset of psychosis in an adolescent girl following academic stress due to the inability to carry on her education through online classes. The third case demonstrates the exacerbation of dissociative episodes in a child following the financial crisis in the family during the lockdown period. In low-income to middle-income countries such as India, there is a complex interplay of the psychosocial stressors due to the COVID-19 pandemic with pre-existing issues such as poverty, socioeconomic disparity and inequity of resources leading to a ‘double hit’ for people from disadvantaged sections of the society and individuals with pre-existing mental illness or vulnerability for mental illness.","Mahapatra, Ananya; Sharma, Prerna",Gen Psychiatr,https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192240/,250

Objective: This review aims to describe the impact of greenspace interventions on cortisol, to present the current state of the science on GSIs as they impact cortisol, and to uncover any limitations of current research strategies to best inform future research. Methods: A scoping methodology was conducted to systematically study this emerging field and inform future research by mapping the literature based on the GSI category, interventional design, cortisol metrics, and subsequent analysis of cortisol. Conclusion: Considerable heterogeneity in research design, aim(s), interventional strategy, and cortisol metrics were identified from a total of 18 studies on GSIs and cortisol outcomes.

A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) dataset for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance nuclear protein important for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.","Almasy, Katherine M.; Davies, Jonathan P.; Plate, Lars",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758849/,250

If conducted inappropriately, nasopharyngeal swab collection can be painful and preanalytical sample collection errors may lead to false negative results. Our objective was to develop a realistic and easily available synthetic simulator for nasopharyngeal swab collection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nasopharyngeal swab collection simulator was designed through different development steps: segmentation, computer-aided design (CAD), and 3D printing. The model was 3D printed using PolyJet technology, which allows multi-material printing using hard and soft materials. RESULTS: The simulator splits in the parasagittal plane close to the septum to allow better visualization and understanding of nasal cavity landmarks. The model is able to simulate the softness and texture of different structural elements. The simulator allows the user to conduct realistic nasopharyngeal swab collection. A colored pad on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx provides real-time feedback to the user. The simulator also permits incorrect swab insertion, which is of obvious benefit from a training perspective. Comprehensive 3D files for printing and full instructions for manufacturing the simulator is freely available online via an open access link. CONCLUSION: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a nasopharyngeal swab collection simulator which can be produced by 3D printing via an open access link, which offers complete operating instructions.","Sananès, Nicolas; Lodi, Massimo; Koch, Antoine; Lecointre, Lise; Sananès, Axel; Lefebvre, Nicolas; Debry, Christian",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156390/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06454-1,250

Besides acting as an intracellular receptor for cyclosporine A, CypA plays a vital role in microorganismal infections, cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, kidney diseases, neurodegeneration, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, sepsis, asthma, and aging. This review focuses on the pivotal roles of CypA in the infection of etiological agents, which manifests mainly in promoting or inhibiting viral replication based on the host cell type and viral species. CypA can interact with viral proteins and thus regulate the replication cycle of the virus. CypA is involved in pathogenic bacterial infections by regulating the formation of host actin skeleton or membrane translocation of bacterial toxins, or mediated the adhesion of Mycoplasma genitalium during the infection processes by acting as a cellular receptor of M. genitalium. CypA also plays a critical role in infection or the life cycle of certain parasites or host immune regulation. Moreover, we summarized the current understanding of CypA inhibitors acting as host-targeting antiviral agents, thus opening an avenue for the treatment of multiple viral infections due to their broad antiviral effects and ability to effectively prevent drug resistance. Therefore, the antiviral effect of CypA has the potential to promote CypA inhibitors as host-targeting drugs to CypA-involved etiological agent infections and human diseases. KEY POINTS: • CypA is involved in the replication and infection of several viruses, pathogenic bacteria, mycoplasma, and parasites. • CypA inhibitors are in a strong position to inhibit the infection of viruses, bacterial, and mycoplasma.","Liao, Yating; Luo, Dan; Peng, Kailan; Zeng, Yanhua",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11115-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33492451/,250

This ‘Store’ would use a number of sources of population data to provide a ‘single source of truth’ about the spread of the coronavirus in England. The initiative illustrates the difficulty of relying on automated processing when making healthcare decisions under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The end-product of the store, a number of ‘dashboards’ for decision-makers, was intended to include models and simulations developed through artificial intelligence. Decisions made on the basis of these dashboards would be significant, even (it was suggested) to the point of diverting patients and critical resources between hospitals based on their predictions. How these models will be developed, and externally validated, remains unclear. This is an issue if they are intended to be used for decisions which will affect patients so directly and acutely. We have (by default) a right under the GDPR not to be subject to significant decisions based solely on automated decision-making. It is not obvious, at present, whether resource allocation within the NHS could take place in reliance on this automated modelling. The recent A Level debacle illustrates, in the context of education, the risks of basing life-changing decisions on the national application of a single equation.

However, the association between stress and seizures has not been thoroughly investigated. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing tremendous collateral stress. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the COVID‐19 outbreak on seizures in PWE in the most severely affected area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities. METHODS: In this single‐center, cross‐sectional study, PWE were surveyed via online questionnaires between February 23 and March 5, 2020. Collected data included demographic information, epilepsy‐related characteristics (seizure type, frequency, antiepileptic drugs [AEDs], and medication management), direct and perceived threat of COVID‐19, and changes in seizures during the outbreak. Psychological comorbidities were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire–9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 items, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify precipitants for seizure exacerbation. RESULTS: We received 362 completed questionnaires after excluding 12 duplicates (response rate = 63.51%). A total of 31 (8.56%) patients had increased seizures during the outbreak. Exposure history to COVID‐19 (P = .001), uncontrolled seizure after AED therapy (P = .020), seizure frequency of two or more times per month before the outbreak (P = .005), change of AED regimen during the outbreak (AED reduction, withdrawal, replacement, skipping altogether; P = .002), and worry about the adverse effect of the outbreak on overall seizure‐related issues (severity = moderate to critical; P = .038) were risk factors for increased seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: A minority of PWE experienced seizure exacerbation during the outbreak of COVID‐19. Stress, uncontrolled seizures, and inappropriate change in AED regimen were associated with increased seizures. Based on these findings, stress might be an independent precipitant for triggering seizures in some PWE.","Huang, Shanshan; Wu, Chunmei; Jia, Yuchao; Li, Guo; Zhu, Zhou; Lu, Kai; Yang, Yuyan; Wang, Furong; Zhu, Suiqiang",Epilepsia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32761900/; https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16635,250

The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4(5) mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that ‘sialidase-sensitive’ animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas ‘sialidase-insensitive’ human rotavirus (HR) strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1(3). Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies(1,3,6,7), it is not yet known how VP8* of HRs interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. We found that VP8* of a HR strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-Atype antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in CHO cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of HR. HBGAs are genetically determined glycoconjugates present in mucosal secretions, epithelial and on red blood cells(8), and are recognized as susceptibility and cell attachment factors for gastric pathogens like H. pylori(9) and noroviruses(10). Our crystallographic studies show that the A-type HBGA binds to the HR VP8* at the same location as the Sia in the VP8* of animal rotavirus, and suggest how subtle changes within the same structural framework allow for such receptor switching. These results raise the possibility that host susceptibility to specific HR strains and pathogenesis are influenced by genetically controlled expression of different HBGAs among the world’s population.","Hu, Liya; Crawford, Sue E.; Czako, Rita; Cortes-Penfield, Nicolas W; Smith, David F.; Le Pendu, Jacques; Estes, Mary K.; Venkataram Prasad, B.

648751,The ecology of COVID-19 and related environmental and sustainability issues,2021-07-19,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the Coalition for Physician Accountability Work Group on Medical Students in the Class of 2021 recommended limiting visiting medical student rotations, conducting virtual residency interviews, and delaying the standard application timeline due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These changes create both challenges and opportunities for medical students and radiation oncology residency programs. We conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to prepare for a virtual recruitment season, including a focus group of senior medical students seeking careers in oncology. METHODS: A single 1.5-hour focus group was conducted with 10 third- and fourth-year medical students using Zoom videoconferencing software. Participants shared opinions relating to visibility of residency programs, virtual clerkship experiences, expectations for program websites, and remote interviews. The focus group recording was transcribed and analyzed independently by 2 authors. Participants’ statements were abstracted into themes via inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Inductive content analysis of the focus group transcript identified several potential challenges surrounding virtual recruitment, including learning the culture of a program and/or city, obtaining accurate information about training programs, and uncertainty surrounding the best way to present themselves during a virtual interview season. In the present environment, the focus group participants anticipate relying more on departmental websites and telecommunications since in-person interactions will be limited. In addition, students perceived that the educational yield of a virtual clerkship would be low, particularly if an in-person rotation had already been completed at another institution. CONCLUSION: With the COVID-19 crisis limiting visiting student rotations and programs transitioning to hosting remote interviews, we recommend programs focus resources towards portraying the culture of their program and city, accurately depicting program information, and offering virtual electives or virtual interaction to increase applicant exposure to residency program culture.","Everett, Ashlyn S.; Strickler, Scott; Marcrom, Samuel R.; McDonald, Andrew M.",Adv Radiat Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452109420302220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923744/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2020.08.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420302220?v=s5,250

Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. METHODS: We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. RESULTS: We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms were present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.","Liguori, Claudio; Pierantozzi, Mariangela; Spanetta, Matteo; Sarmati, Loredana; Cesta, Novella; Iannetta, Marco; Ora, Josuel; Genga Mina, Grazia; Puxeddu, Ermanno; Balbi, Ottavia; Pezzuto, Gabriella; Magrini, Andrea; Rogliani, Paola; Andreoni, Massimo; Biagio Mercuri, Nicola",Brain Behav Immun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088915912030876X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416289/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912030876X?v=s5,250

It is recommended that the public should cultivate the basic skills to evaluate information and determine its validity. On the other hand, the authorities should refrain from placing the blame on patients to avoid them from being stigmatized.

The phenomenon appears to be quite widespread among nurses and nursing students; nomophobic behaviours of professionals can lead to an impoverishment of the care provided. The aim of this study is to investigate the construct in a University and in an hospital in northern Italy and evaluate the levels of nomophobia between nurses and students. METHODS: It has been conducted an observational study with a questionnaire with a sample of nursing students and nurses. Both the two studies had the common goal to investigate the levels of nomophobia and evaluate the comparison between the two groups. RESULTS: In general, both nurses and students they don’t seem to demonstrate nomophobia’s critical levels. The comparison of the daily use of the smartphone between nurses and students shows that the frequent use of students is balanced by the nurses’ daily trend line that progressively decreases. Both nurses and students affirm to use, with a certain frequency their smartphone at work although, above all the students, usually for appropriate and justified reasons. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to consider the development of an educational project that regularizes the use of smartphones, explaining the meaning of nomophobia, right from the beginning of the University career so to correctly address the student’s (and future professionals) behaviours to make them aware of mobile phones’ misuse, especially in the clinical setting that can easily cause distractions and consequently irreversible errors.

In this paper, Beta regression is introduced as a tool to analyze the rate of hospitalization and the proportion of Intensive Care Unit admissions over both hospitalized and diagnosed patients, with the aim of explaining as well as predicting, and thus allowing to better anticipate, the impact on hospital resources during an early-phase epidemic. This is applied to the initial phase COVID-19 pandemic in Spain and its different regions from 20-Feb to 08-Apr of 2020. Spatial and temporal factors are included in the Beta distribution through a precision factor.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the intermittent irradiation of 222 nm UVC on SARS-CoV-2 and the fluence-dependent effect of 222 nm UVC irradiation on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. METHODS: We experimented with 5 min continuous and intermittent irradiation for 0.1, 0.05, 0.013, and 0.003 mW/cm(2) of 222 nm UVC to evaluate the differences in the effect of the continuous and intermittent irradiation of 222 nm UVC on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. For intermittent irradiation, we followed the on-off irradiation cycles with every 10-s irradiation followed by a 380-s interval. Thereafter, we evaluated the effects of 0.1, 0.013, and 0.003 mW/cm(2) 222 nm UVC irradiation on SARS-CoV-2 contamination at UV fluences of 1, 2, and 3 mJ/cm(2) at each irradiance. RESULTS: At each irradiance, no significant difference was observed in the log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 between continuous and intermittent irradiation. At each UV fluence, no significant difference was observed in the log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 among the three different irradiance levels. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between continuous and intermittent irradiation with 222 nm UVC with regards to SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. Moreover, 222 nm UVC inactivates SARS-CoV-2 in a fluence-dependent manner. The efficacy of 222-nm UVC irradiation in reducing the contamination of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be further evaluated in a real-world setting.","Kitagawa, Hiroki; Nomura, Toshihito; Nazmul, Tanuza; Kawano, Reo; Omori, Keitaro; Shigemoto, Norifumi; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Ohge, Hiroki",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484873/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1572100021000107; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pdpdt.2021.102184; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572100021000107?v=s5,250

This US survey of breast cancer survivors characterizes treatment delays early period in the pandemic. METHODS: We developed a survey and administered it to 609 adult breast cancer survivors in the US. We used snowball sampling with invitations distributed via social media. We used logistic regression to select a model of delay from a pool of independent variables including race, cancer stage, site of care, health insurance, and age. We used descriptive statistics to characterize delay types. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of participants reported cancer care treatment delays during the pandemic. Delays in all aspects of cancer care and treatment were reported. The only variable which had a significant effect was age (97 (.95, 99), p < 0.001) with younger respondents (M = 45.94, SD = 10.31) reporting a higher incidence of delays than older respondents (M = 48.98, SD = 11.10). There was no significant effect for race, insurance, site of care, or cancer stage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a pervasive impact of COVID-19 on breast cancer care and a gap in disaster preparedness that leaves cancer survivors at risk for poor outcomes. Delays are critical to capture and characterize to help cancer providers and healthcare systems develop effective and patient–tailored processes and strategies to manage cases during the current pandemic wave, subsequent waves, and future disasters.","Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Hamlish, Tamara",Breast Cancer Res Treat,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-020-05828-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772225/,250
653179,Ethical guidelines for deliberately infecting volunteers with COVID-19,2020-05-27,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is an important cause of respiratory disease. The majority of studies addressing the importance of virus co‐infections to the HRSV‐disease have been based on the detection of HRSV by RT‐PCR, which may not distinguish current replication from prolonged shedding of remnant RNA from previous HRSV infections. To assess whether co‐detections of other common respiratory viruses are associated with increased severity of HRSV illnesses from patients who were shedding viable‐HRSV, nasopharyngeal aspirates from children younger than 5 years who sought medical care for respiratory infections in Ribeirão Preto (Brazil) were tested for HRSV by immunofluorescence, RT‐PCR and virus isolation in cell culture. All samples with viable‐HRSV were tested further by PCR for other respiratory viruses. HRSV‐disease severity was assessed by a clinical score scale. A total of 266 samples from 247 children were collected and 111 (42%) were HRSV‐positive. HRSV was isolated from 70 (63%), and 52 (74%) of them were positive for at least one additional virus. HRSV‐positive diseases were more severe than HRSV‐negative ones, but there was no difference in disease severity between patients with viable‐HRSV and those HRSV‐positives by RT‐PCR. Co‐detection of other viruses did not correlate with increased disease severity. HRSV isolation in cell culture does not seem to be superior to RT‐PCR to distinguish infections associated with HRSV replication in studies of clinical impact of HRSV. A high rate of co‐detection of other respiratory viruses was found in samples with viable‐HRSV, but this was not associated with more severe HRSV infection. J Med.

655059,"Red herrings, circuit-breakers and ageism in the COVID-19 debate",2021-01-13,"UV radiation can inactivate viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. However, designing effective UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems can be difficult because the effects of dried respiratory droplets and other fomites on UV light intensities are poorly understood. Numerical modeling of UV intensities inside virus-containing particles on surfaces can increase understanding of these possible reductions in UV intensity. We model UV intensities within spherical approximations of virions randomly positioned within spherical particles. The model virions and dried particles have sizes and optical properties to approximate SARS-CoV-2 and dried particles formed from respiratory droplets, respectively. In 1-, 5- and 9-µm diameter particles on a surface, illuminated by 260-nm UV light from a direction perpendicular to the surface, 0%, 10% and 18% (respectively) of simulated virions are exposed to intensities less than 1/100(th) of intensities in individually exposed virions (i.e., they are partially shielded). Even for 302-nm light (simulating sunlight), where absorption is small, 0% and 11% of virions in 1- and 9-µm particles have exposures 1/100(th) those of individually exposed virions. Shielding is small to negligible in sub-micron particles. Results show that shielding of virions in a particle can be reduced by illuminating a particle either from multiple widely separated incident directions, or by illuminating a particle rotating in air for a time sufficient to rotate through enough orientations. Because highly UV-reflective paints and surfaces can increase the angular ranges of illumination and the intensities within particles, they appear likely to be useful for reducing shielding of virions embedded within particles.","Doughty, David C.; Hill, Steven C.; Mackowski, Daniel W.",J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518804/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407320310177; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022407320310177; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107489,250

Various types of nanoparticles with diverse pathogenic or foreign antigens can help to overcome immunotolerance and alleviate the need of booster doses as required with conventional vaccines. Nanovaccines have the potential to induce both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity and can render long-lasting immunogenic memory. With such properties, nanovaccines have shown high potential for the prevention of infectious diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and cancer. Their therapeutic potential has also been explored in the treatment of cancer. The various kinds of nanomaterials used for vaccine development and their effects on immune system activation have been discussed with special relevance to their implications in various pathological conditions. Statement of Significance Interaction of nanoparticles with the immune system has opened multiple avenues to combat a variety of infectious and non-infectious pathological conditions. Limitations of conventional vaccines have paved the path for nanomedicine associated benefits with a hope of producing effective nanovaccines. This review highlights the role of different types of nanovaccines and the role of nanoparticles in modulating the immune response of vaccines.

By comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalizations or confirmed cases under different interventions, we provide evidence that school closures contribute to a reduction in the growth rate approximately 7 days after implementation. Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. In countries where community transmission is generally low, such as Denmark or Norway, a large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible. However, school reopening can contribute to statistically significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high.

Recent attempts to quantify such impacts mainly focused on a basin or larger scale, or used limited time periods that largely ignore observations of long-term trends at a fine resolution, thereby affecting the recognition of climate change’s effect on ecosystem services. OBJECTIVES: This study conducts a detailed and spatially explicit recognition of climate change’s effect on ecosystem services and provides an intuitive map for decision-making and climate change adaptation planning. METHODS: We used long-term time series of ecosystem service assessments and various future climate scenarios to quantify the sensitivity and future exposure of ecosystem services to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau. RESULTS: Carbon sequestration (CS) and habitat quality experience significant growth, while water retention did not show any trend. Sensitivity patterns of these ecosystem services vary largely. For CS, more than half of the pixels showed a positive sensitivity to climate change, even though the degree of sensitivity is not high. There is substantial spatial heterogeneity in the exposure of ecosystem services to future climate changes, and high levels of future climate change increase the intensity of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the complex spatial association between ecosystem services and climatic drivers, and these findings can help optimize local response strategies in the context of global warming. For example, the existing protected areas have notable conservation gaps for disturbance of future climate change on ecosystem services, especially in the southeastern part of the study area.

The data from past and present outbreaks indicate that individuals with comorbidities are significantly more susceptible to infections and yield poorer clinical outcomes. Our simulation study revealed that the prevention of morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease bears an enormous potential to decrease the COVID-19 death toll. The accumulating evidence emphasizes our ability to reduce both the susceptibility of uninfected individuals to pathogenic factors, as well as the mortality of infected individuals during pandemics by adopting a more comprehensive approach to disease prevention. Higher utilization of clinical preventive services is critical to reduce pandemic deaths and increase our preparedness for future outbreaks.","Agrawal, Siddarth; Gołębiowska, Justyna; Bartoszewicz, Bartłomiej; Makuch, Sebastian; Mazur, Grzegorz",Prev Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251094/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101249; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335520302072?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211335520302072,250

METHODS: A total of 5839 patients admitted to PED during the lockdown period (LP) between March 30 and May 31, 2020, were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Data of these patients were compared to those of patients in the same period in 2019 between April 1 and June 2, 2019 (non-LP). We also investigated the monthly number of PED visits and hospitalizations between March 1 and December 31, 2020, and compared it to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The volume of PED visits and hospitalizations in LP decreased by 12% and 41.6%, respectively. The rates of patients presenting anxiety and depressive disorders and bipolar disorders were found to significantly increase in LP than non-LP (p < 0.001; p < 0.001; p < 0.01, respectively). Depressive disorders, prior history of mental illness, and aggressive behavior were found to predict frequent PED visits while decrease in age and male gender found to predict hospitalizations. Regarding suicide attempt, younger patients and those with new-onset mental disorders were found to be at high risk in LP. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in PED visits were mostly with psychotic and bipolar disorders. CONCLUSION: Policy-makers should focus on studies on mental health services to reorganize and enhance such services, which are crucial to prevent and manage adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic and congestion in PEDs.","Yalçın, Murat; Baş, Alper; Bilici, Rabia; Özdemir, Yusuf Özay; Beştepe, Engin Emrem; Kurnaz, Samet; Güneş, Mustafa; Kurt, Velat; Koyu, Elif",Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02171-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482427/,250

Paulo city, Brazil",2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND: During the recent outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), Lombardy was the most affected region in Italy, with 87,000 patients and 15,876 deaths up to May 26, 2020. Since February 22, 2020, well before the Government declared a state of emergency, there was a huge reduction in the number of emergency surgeries performed at hospitals in Lombardy. A general decrease in attendance at emergency departments (EDs) was also observed. The aim of our study is to report the experience of the ED of a third-level hospital in downtown Milan, Lombardy, and provide possible explanations for the observed phenomena. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study assessed the volume of emergency surgeries and attendance at an ED during the course of the pandemic, i.e. immediately before, during and after a progressive community lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data were compared with data from the same time periods in 2019. The results are presented as means, standard error (SE), and 95% studentized confidence intervals (CI). The Wilcoxon rank signed test at a 0.05 significance level was used to assess differences in per-day ED access distributions. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, a significant overall drop in emergency surgeries (60%, p < 0.002) and in ED admittance (66%, p ≅ 0) was observed in 2020. In particular, there were significant decreases in medical (40%), surgical (74%), specialist (ophthalmology, otolaryngology, traumatology, and urology) (92%), and psychiatric (60%) cases. ED admittance due to domestic violence (59%) and individuals who left the ED without being seen (76%) also decreased. Conversely, the number of deaths increased by 196%. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak the volume of urgent surgeries and patients accessing our ED dropped. Currently, it is not known if mortality of people who did not seek care increased during the pandemic. Further studies are needed to understand if such reductions during the COVID-19 pandemic will result in a rebound of patients left untreated or in unwanted consequences for population health.

Despite the scientists’ struggle to find and/or creating possible drugs, so far there is no treatment with high efficiency for the disease. During the pandemic, researchers have performed some molecular analyses to find potential therapeutics out of both the natural and synthetic available medicines. Computer simulations and related data have shown a significant role in drug discovery and development before. In this field, antiviral drugs, phytochemicals, anti-inflammatory agents, etc. were essential groups of compounds tested against COVID-19, using molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD), and docking tools. The results indicate promising effects of such compounds to be used in further experimental and clinical trials; Chloroquine, Chloroquine-OH, and Umifenovir as viral entry inhibitors, Remdesivir, Ribavirin, Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Darunavir as viral replication inhibitors, and Sirolimus are the examples, which were tested clinically on patients after comprehensive assessments of the available data on molecular simulation.

661963,Social multipliers and the Covid-19 epidemic: Analysis through constrained maximum entropy modeling,2020-09-02,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is mainly caused by inflammation and is associated with high mortality rates. Emerging evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) serve a significant function in ALI. However, the fundamental mechanism underlying ALI remain to be fully elucidated. Although miR-16 has been reported to be involved in the occurrence and development of a number of diseases its association with ALI has not been previously investigated. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the role of miR-16 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model. The expression levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 were measured by ELISA in the blood samples of rats with ALI and in the normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell line. The role of miR-16 in inflammation was evaluated using gene overexpression and silencing experiments in NHBE cells by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. In addition, the expression levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were also determined using ELISA. The potential interaction between miR-16 and TLR4 was assessed using bioinformatics analysis by the TargetScan database and then verified in 293T cells using luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-16 was notably decreased in the lung tissues of rats with LPS-induced ALI compared with the PBS treated-group. Additionally, the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were reduced following transfection of NHBE cells with miR-16 mimics compared with those in the miR-negative control group. Western blot analysis revealed that miR-16 overexpression could downregulate TLR4 expression in NHBE cells compared with that in the miR-NC group. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that TLR4 may be directly targeted by miR-16. The effect of miR-16 on TLR4 was rescued in NHBE cells following treatment with LPS. Overall, these aforementioned findings suggest that miR-16 may serve a protective role against LPS-mediated inflammatory responses in NHBE cells by regulating TLR4, where this mechanism may be considered to be a novel approach for treating ALI in the future.","Li, Xiaobo; Chu, Qian; Wang, Huaqi",Exp Ther Med,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2021.10414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34345264/,250

Here, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3048 and REGN3051 in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection. Intravenous administration of mAb resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating blood. When animals were treated with mAbs one day before challenge, respiratory disease was less severe and, in animals treated with both REGN3048 and REGN3051, viral loads in the lungs were reduced. However, therapeutic treatment on day one after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals. Thus, mAb administration may be more effective in a prophylactic treatment regimen rather than treatment of MERS.","de Wit, Emmie; Feldmann, Friederike; Okumura, Atsushi; Horne, Eva; Haddock, Elaine; Saturday, Greg; Scott, Dana; Erlandson, Karl J.; Stahl, Neil; Lipsich, Leah; Kyratsous, Christos A.; Feldmann, Heinz",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354218301840; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.06.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354218301840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29885377/,250

METHODS: A total of 74 ED patients in treatment before the COVID‐19 outbreak, contributed to this study. Baseline pre‐treatment evaluation included the SCL‐90R, TCI‐R, EDI‐2 and Y‐FAS 2.0 questionnaires for general psychopathology, personality and ED severity indexes. ED symptoms, coping strategies, socio‐demographic data and COVID‐19 concerns were collected by clinicians through a semi‐structured telephone survey during lockdown. RESULTS: A deterioration in ED symptoms and general psychopathology (anxiety and depression), during lockdown, was associated with low self‐directedness. Higher ED symptomatology during confinement was associated with less‐adaptive coping strategies to deal with lockdown situation leading to an increase in weight.

METHODS: This study utilized a questionnaire to collect institutional data about hospital infrastructure and volume of patient safety activities from all 1039 teaching hospitals in Japan. The patient safety activities were focused on meetings and conferences, internal audits, staff education and training, incident reporting and infection surveillance. Generalized linear modeling was used. RESULTS: Of the 1039 hospitals surveyed, 418 (40.2%) hospitals participated. The amount of activities significantly increased by over 30% in hospitals with dedicated patient safety and infection control full-time staff (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). High profit margins also predicted the increase of patient safety programs (P < 0.01). Perceived lack of administrative leadership was associated with reduced volume of activities (P < 0.05), and the economic burden of safety programs was found to be disproportionately large for small hospitals (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals with increased resources had greater spread of patient safety and infection control activities. To promote patient safety programs in hospitals, it is imperative that policy makers require the assignment of dedicated full-time staff to patient safety. Economic support for hospitals will also be required to assure that safety programs are sustainable.","Fukuda, Haruhisa; Imanaka, Yuichi; Hirose, Masahiro; Hayashida, Kenshi",Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18538442/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851008001036; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.04.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851008001036,250

The extract usually consists of many components but the key ingredients are glycyrrhizic (GL) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA). GL and GA function as potent antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antitumor agents, and immuneregulators. GL and GA have potent activities against hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus, influenza A, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, vaccinia virus, and arboviruses. Also, GA was observed to be of therapeutic valve in human enterovirus 71, which was recognized as the utmost regular virus responsible for hand, foot, and mouth disease. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of GL and GA is realized via cytokines like interferon-γ, tumor necrotizing factor-α, interleukin- (IL-) 1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-17. They also modulate anti-inflammatory mechanisms like intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 and P-selectin, enzymes like inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B, signal transducer and activator of transcription- (STAT-) 3, and STAT-6. Furthermore, DCs treated with GL were capable of influencing T-cell differentiation toward Th1 subset. Moreover, GA is capable of blocking prostaglandin-E2 synthesis via blockade of cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 resulting in concurrent augmentation nitric oxide production through the enhancement of iNOS2 mRNA secretion in Leishmania-infected macrophages.

Indium’s load–displacement data are found to be very similar to that of high-purity lithium. Residual hardness impressions show two distinct surface morphologies. Based on these morphologies, the measured hardness, and the estimated pile-up volume, it is proposed that residual impressions exhibiting significant pile-up are the result of deformation dominated by interface diffusion. Alternatively, impressions with no significant pile-up are taken to be the result of shear-driven dislocation glide.

Data of all 131 confirmed cases in Tianjin before February 20 were collected. By February 20, a total of 14/16 districts reported COVID-19 cases, with Baodi district reporting the most cases (n = 56). A total of 22 (16.8%) cases had a Wuhan-related exposure. Fever was the most common symptom (82.4%). The median duration of symptom onset to treatment was [1.0 (0.0–4.0) days], the duration of symptom onset to isolation [2.0 (0.0–6.0) days], and the duration of symptom onset to diagnosis [5.0 (2.0–8.0) days]. The analysis of the transmission chain showed two cluster infections with 62 cases infected. Transmission from a family member constituted 42%, usually at the end of transmission chain. Compared with patients with non-severe infections, patients with severe infections were more likely to be male (46.2 vs. 77.3%, P = 0.009) and had a Wuhan-related exposure (14.0 vs. 40.9%, P = 0.004). Multivariate logistic regression showed that male (OR 3.913, 95% CI 1.206, 12.696; P = 0.023) was an independent risk factor for severe infection. This study provides evidence on the epidemic of COVID-19 by analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases in Tianjin.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the experiences and beliefs of low‐income and minority patients with hypertension during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Participants (N=587) from the IMPACTS‐BP (Implementation of Multifaceted Patient‐Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control) study completed a telephone survey in May and June of 2020. Participants were 65.1% Black and 59.7% female, and 57.7% reported an income below the federal poverty level. Overall, 2.7% tested positive and 15.3% had lost a family member or friend to COVID‐19. These experiences were significantly more common in Black (3.9% and 19.4%, respectively) than in non‐Black participants (0.5% and 7.8%, respectively). In addition, 14.5% lost a job and 15.9% reported food shortages during the pandemic. Most participants complied with stay‐at‐home orders (98.3%), social distancing (97.8%), and always wearing a mask outside their home (74.6%). Participants also reported high access to needed health care (94.7%) and prescription medications (97.6%).

We find that it exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic region. Our results reveal a higher-affinity, previously unknown binding site localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed strain analysis indicates that, on such a site, ebselen exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access through surface-loop interactions, thereby inducing a reconfiguration of water hotspots.

Italy was the first western country where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread to a significant extent. In this representative cross-sectional survey, we aimed to describe some opinions and attitudes of the Italian general population towards both influenza vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify potential modifiers of the decision-making process regarding the uptake of the 2020/21 influenza vaccine. A total of 2543 responses were analyzed. Although most (74.8%) participants valued influenza vaccination positively and declared that it should be mandatory, some misconceptions around influenza persist. The general practitioner was the main source of trusted information on influenza vaccines, while social networks were judged to be the least reliable. Younger and less affluent individuals, subjects not vaccinated in the previous season, and those living in smaller communities showed lower odds of receiving the 2020/21 season influenza vaccination.

In these latter hosts, the ORF3 gene systematically displays one or two identical deletions leading to the synthesis of truncated proteins gp3-Δ1 and gp3-Δ2. As deletions in CoV accessory proteins have already been involved in tissue or host switch, studies of these different gp3 proteins were conducted in canine and feline cell. All proteins oligomerise through covalent bonds, are N-glycosylated and are maintained in the ER in non-infected but also in CCoV-II infected cells, without any specific retention signal. However, deletions influence their level of expression. In canine cells, all proteins are expressed with similar level whereas in feline cells, the expression of gp3-Δ1 is higher than the two other forms of gp3. None of the gp3 proteins modulate the viral replication cycle of heterologous genotype II CCoV in canine cell line, leading to the conclusion that the gp3 proteins are probably advantageous only for CCoV-I and atypical FCoV strains.","Pham-Hung d’Alexandry d’Orengiani, Anne-Laure; Duarte, Lidia; Pavio, Nicole; Le Poder, Sophie",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215000520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25665789/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215000520; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.01.027,250

Furthermore, the resulting extensive use of antimicrobial treatments is a growing concern from the perspective of facilitating antibiotic resistant microbes. The earlier detection of BRD would enable an earlier, more targeted treatment regime and earlier isolation of infected individuals. The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of non-invasive infrared thermography in the early detection of BRD in cattle. Studies were conducted on 133 head of weaned calves. Data demonstrated that infrared thermography was able to identify animals at early stages of illness, often several days to over one week before clinical signs were manifest. Data indicated that 4–6 days prior to the onset of clinical symptoms of BRD, greater positive and negative predictive values and test efficiency for infrared thermography (80%, 65% and 71%, respectively) compared to the industry standard practice of clinical scoring (70%, 45% and 55%, respectively).","Schaefer, A.L.; Cook, N.J.; Church, J.S.; Basarab, J.; Perry, B.; Miller, C.; Tong, A.K.W.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528807000100; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528807000100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17349665/,250

All three with other compounds, constitute a cocktail-mixture that consumers (and also animals) are exposed and never entirely evaluated, nor in vitro nor in vivo. Effect of ZEA has been correlated to endocrine disruptor alterations as well as its metabolites (α-ZEL and β-ZEL); however, toxic effects associated to metabolites generated once ingested are unknown and difficult to study. The present study defines the metabolomics profile of all three mycotoxins (ZEA, α-ZEL and β-ZEL) and explores the prediction of their toxic effects proposing an in silico workflow by using three programs of predictions: MetaTox, SwissADME and PASS online. Metabolomic profile was also defined and toxic effect evaluated for all metabolite products from Phase I and II reaction (a total of 15 compounds). Results revealed that products describing metabolomics profile were: from O-glucuronidation (1z and 2z for ZEA and 1ab, 2ab and 3ab for ZEA´s metabolites), S-sulfation (3z and 4z for ZEA and 4ab, 5ab and 6ab for ZEA´s metabolites) and hydrolysis (5z and 7ab for ZEA´s metabolites, respectively). Lipinsky´s rule-of-five was followed by all compounds except those coming from O-glucuronidation (HBA>10). Metabolite products had better properties to reach blood brain barrier than initial mycotoxins.

Alors que l’obésité a été reconnue comme facteur de risque indépendant important d’infection pulmonaire grave et de mortalité par grippe A H1N1, ce n’est que récemment que de petites séries de cas publiées ont suggéré une association entre l’obésité et des formes plus graves de COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Pour évaluer les facteurs associés à l’aggravation pulmonaire de COVID-19, nous avons mené une étude cas-témoins multicentrique comparant 58 patients adultes nécessitant une ventilation mécanique invasive pour COVID-19 à 58 patients hospitalisés pour COVID-19, appariés selon le sexe et l’âge et ne nécessitant pas de ventilation mécanique invasive. Les patients étaient inclus dans les deux centres prenant en charge des patients atteints de COVID-19 d’une grande ville. Les patients pour lesquels une admission potentielle en unité de soins intensifs était jugée déraisonnable (limitation des soins) ont été exclus du groupe contrôle. Les caractéristiques démographiques, les antécédents, les paramètres cliniques au diagnostic et la prise en charge des patients des groupes « cas » et « contrôles » ont été recueillis. Résultats Entre le 27 février et le 6 avril 2020, 249 patients présentant une infection confirmée par COVID-19 ont été hospitalisés, dont 218 (88 %) souffraient d’une pneumopathie radiologique. Parmi ces 249 patients, 69 (28 %) ont été admis en réanimation et 58 (23 %) ont été intubés et correspondaient aux « cas ». Des témoins appariés ont été sélectionnés parmi 129 patients hospitalisés (2 enfants et 60 sujets pour qui il était décidé une limitation de soins ont été exclus). Il n’y avait pas de différence significative entre les cas et les témoins en termes de prévalence du tabagisme actif et de prévalence des maladies sous-jacentes parmi lesquelles diabète, hypertension artérielle, cardiopathies et pathologies respiratoires chroniques. Les cas présentaient un indice de masse corporelle (IMC) médian significativement plus élevé et une prévalence plus élevée de surpoids (IMC≥25kg/m2 ; 46,6 % contre 39,7 %) et d’obésité (IMC≥30kg/m2 ; 34,5 % contre 19 %), à la fois obésité modérée et sévère, que les témoins. En analyse univariée, les seuls facteurs significativement associés à la ventilation mécanique invasive étaient le surpoids (odd ratio : 2,73, IC95 : 1,03–7,23) et l’obésité (odd ratio : 4,06, 1,36–12,14). Après correction des facteurs de confusion potentiels, seule l’obésité restait significativement associée à la ventilation mécanique invasive (odd ratio ajusté : 5,26, IC95 % : 1,5–18,48). Conclusion Les patients obèses hospitalisés pour COVID-19 sont plus à risque d’être intubés pour syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë.

The division of infectious diseases of ASST (Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale) Spedali Civili Hospital of Brescia had to face a great number of inpatients with severe COVID-19 infection and to ensure the continuum of care for almost 4000 outpatients with HIV infection actively followed by us. In a recent manuscript we described the impact of the pandemic on continuum of care in our HIV cohort expressed as number of missed visits, number of new HIV diagnosis, drop in ART (antiretroviral therapy) dispensation and number of hospitalized HIV patients due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this short communication, we completed the previous article with data of HIV plasmatic viremia of the same cohort before and during pandemic. METHODS: We considered all HIV-patients in stable ART for at least 6 months and with at least 1 available HIV viremia in the time window March 01–November 30, 2019, and another group of HIV patients with the same two requisites but in different time windows of the COVID-19 period (March 01–May 31, 2020, and June 01–November 30, 2020). For patients with positive viremia (PV) during COVID-19 period, we reported also the values of viral load (VL) just before and after PV. Results: the percentage of patients with PV during COVID-19 period was lower than the previous year (2.8% vs 7%). Only 1% of our outpatients surely suffered from pandemic in term of loss of previous viral suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Our efforts to limit the impact of pandemic on our HIV outpatients were effective to ensure HIV continuum of care.","Izzo, Ilaria; Carriero, Canio; Gardini, Giulia; Fumarola, Benedetta; Chiari, Erika; Castelli, Francesco; Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia",AIDS Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12981-021-00355-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088307/,250

Both genes were transiently expressed in either of the CHO cell lines, followed by fusion treatment. Significant SEAP activity could be detected in the culture medium only after cell–cell fusion occurred. Cell–cell fusion provides an environment in which the protease encounters its substrate 4A/4B, thereby releasing SEAP from the fusion protein.

673461,Obtaining prevalence estimates of COVID-19: A model to inform decision-making,2020-08-07,"Background Microvascular dysfunction, serum cytokines and chemokines may play important roles in pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in severe cases. Methods Patients with COVID-19 underwent non-invasive evaluation of systemic endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity - using laser Doppler perfusion monitoring in the skin of the forearm - coupled to local thermal hyperemia. Maximal microvascular vasodilatation (44° C thermal plateau phase) was used as endpoint. A multiplex biometric immunoassay was used to assess a panel of 48 serum cytokines and chemokines. Severe COVID-19 (S-COVID) was defined according to WHO criteria, while all other cases of COVID-19 were considered mild to moderate (M-COVID). A group of healthy individuals who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 served as a control group and was also evaluated with LDPM. Results Thirty-two patients with COVID-19 (25% S-COVID) and 14 controls were included. Basal microvascular flow was similar between M-COVID and controls (P=0.69) but was higher in S-COVID than in controls (P=0.005) and M-COVID patients (P=0.01). The peak microvascular vasodilator response was markedly decreased in both patient groups (M-COVID, P=0.001; S-COVID, P<0.0001) compared to the healthy group. The percent increases in microvascular flow were markedly reduced in both patient groups (M-COVID, P<0.0001; S-COVID, P<0.0001) compared to controls. Patients with S-COVID had markedly higher concentrations of dissimilar proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, compared to patients with M-COVID. Conclusions In patients with COVID-19, especially with S-COVID, endothelium-dependent microvascular vasodilator responses are reduced, while serum cytokines and chemokines involved in the regulation of vascular function and inflammation are increased.","Sabioni, Letícia; De Lorenzo, Andrea; Lamas, Cristiane; Muccillo, Fabiana; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo Caire; Estato, Vanessa; Tibirica, Eduardo",Microvasc Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mvr.2020.104119; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026286220301795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278457/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026286220301795?v=s5,250

674537,Nurses Confronting the Coronavirus: Challenges Met and Lessons Learned to Date,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Health care systems worldwide have been affected by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emergence since December 2019. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a steep decrease in elective surgery scheduling, to the extent of complete cancellation without future planning of safe development. PURPOSE: We performed a review of the literature and diagnosis data analysis with the aim to reduce the risk of operating a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 during the incubation period. METHODS: We searched for specific words and phrases about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in the PubMed database (US National Library of Medicine) from December 2019 to April 2020. A detailed analysis of the clinical picture and existing diagnostic tests for COVID-19 was performed to achieve the desired objectives. RESULTS: A total of 1273 out of 5930 articles about COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 did meet the criteria for the searched terms. We reviewed 105 articles, and 60 were selected for analysis. Specific recommendations were described based on our revision. CONCLUSIONS: With the combination of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody tests + real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 implemented in different time periods by taking into account the natural history of the disease, it is possible to decrease the risk of operating a patient during the incubation period higher than 93%. Adding other security measures can further increase this percentage. As long as there is no immunity to COVID-19, these measures will help us to perform safer elective surgeries.","Cárdenas-Camarena, Lázaro; Bayter-Marin, Jorge Enrique; Durán, Héctor; Hoyos, Alfredo; López-Romero, César Octavio; Robles-Cervantes, José Antonio; Echeagaray-Guerrero, Ernesto Eduardo",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000002973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766088/,250
675904,Post Covid-19: recovering and sustaining India’s growth,2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND: At the same time that federal policymakers have enforced restrictive immigration policies, healthcare systems across the USA are developing, and have implemented, interventions aimed at addressing immigration-related stressors faced by immigrant communities. Yet, little is known about the contextual determinants that influence their implementation success. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), this study identifies factors enabling or challenging the implementation of interventions aimed at mitigating immigration-related stressors in the healthcare context. METHODS: We used a qualitative research design to conduct 38 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in implementation of interventions at 25 healthcare facilities across 5 states with the highest undocumented immigrant populations (California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois). Interviews were conducted from May through August 2018. Constant comparative analysis was used to identify barrier and facilitator themes. Deductive coding was thereafter used to categorize themes according to CFIR domain. RESULTS: Barriers to implementation included perceptions of legal complexity and challenges to adopting such systemic strategies. Facilitators included a national policy climate that had brought immigrant health to the forefront, allowing for leveraging momentum towards institutional change; communication among healthcare personnel; existing community partnerships with immigrant rights and service organizations; and a shared sense of mission centering health equity. Local variation in immigration-related policies (e.g., local law agencies enforcing federal immigration laws) and heterogeneity of local immigrant communities also impacted implementation. Champions and informal leaders were integral to institutional efforts but not sufficient for sustainability. Perceived urgency to act superseded evaluation considerations, with all interventions in initial phases of implementation. Future iterations and evaluations of these interventions are needed to establish best practices and implementation determinants. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic study describing implementation determinants of immigration-related interventions across health systems. Identifying these determinants provides guidance to other healthcare organizations to effectively strategize and ensure implementation success.

Social media implementation, as one of the most widely used IT application, is expected to support SMEs’ performances. Many types of research in social media have focused on the impact of its implementation on the performance of an organization at a macro level. Research that investigates the linkage between social media and how the company performs its business process is lacking in the literature to date. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a literature review on social media implementation particularly in SMEs. The result of this study is a conceptual model that follows the proposition of Task-Technology Fit in exploring the impact of social media on SMEs business process performances. As a technology, social media functionality must fit the tasks that SMEs must perform. The model proposed social media alignment with business process domain based on the Process Classification Framework (PCF). The performances are measured at a business process level using four indicators i.e. cost, time, quality and flexibility of the business process.","Annisa, Lolanda Hamim; ER, Mahendrawathi",Procedia Computer Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050919319337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288899/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.222; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877050919319337,250

677229,"Publishing during pandemic: Innovation, collaboration, and change",2020-07-10,"Because of the implementation of social distancing measures following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face interaction has plummeted, which has resulted in the prolific use of social networking services (SNS) and increased activity in the cyberspace environment. This is especially true for teenagers and young adults with the shift to online classes in the education sector, which has increased the chances of being exposed to cyberbullying. This study attempts to determine a strategy for counteracting cyberbullying in the post-COVID-19 era by identifying the factors that have contributed toward greater aggression by adolescents in South Korea in 2020 when the spread of COVID-19 was at its height. To achieve this, we employed the Cyberbullying Circumstance Analysis dataset from the Korea Communications Commission for the time frame of between 2019 and 2020, with 4779 and 4958 participants, respectively. The causes and effects that led to cyberbullying were investigated using binary logistic regression analysis. By reviewing the research data targeted towards Korean adolescents, our analysis found that the average age of those who engage in cyberbullying decreased in 2020 compared to 2019. In addition, cyberbullying awareness at school and the school’s capability of controlling it influenced the number of cyberbullies from a statistical grounding, which could be found only in the 2020 dataset. An approach to establishing policies in schools to contain preemptive measures and increase cyberbullying awareness has been proposed to prevent such mishaps in the post-COVID-19 era.","Shin, So Young; Choi, Yeon-Jun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639385/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910085,250
677469,Patient partnership falling to wayside in COVID-19 research rush,2021-07-12,"Coronary artery disease remains one of the primary healthcare problems due to the high cost of treatment, increased number of patients, poor clinical outcomes, and lack of effective therapy. Though pharmacological and surgical treatments positively affect symptoms and arrest the disease progression, they generally exhibit a limited effect on the disease outcome. The development of alternative therapeutic approaches towards ischemic disease treatment, especially of decompensated forms, is therefore relevant. Therapeutic angiogenesis, stimulated by various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, provides the possibility of restoring functional blood flow in ischemic tissues, thereby ensuring the regeneration of the damaged area. In the current study, based on the clinically approved plasmid vector pVax1, multigenic constructs were developed encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGF2), and the DsRed fluorescent protein, integrated via picornaviruses’ furin-2A peptide sequences. In vitro experiments demonstrated that genetically modified cells with engineered plasmid constructs expressed the target proteins. Overexpression of VEGF and FGF2 resulted in increased levels of the recombinant proteins. Concomitantly, these did not lead to a significant shift in the general secretory profile of modified HEK293T cells. Simultaneously, the secretome of genetically modified cells showed significant stimulating effects on the formation of capillary-like structures by HUVEC (endothelial cells) in vitro. Our results revealed that when the multicistronic multigene vectors encoding 2A peptide sequences are created, transient transgene co-expression is ensured. The results obtained indicated the mutual synergistic effects of the growth factors VEGF and FGF2 on the proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro. Thus, recombinant multicistronic multigenic constructs might serve as a promising approach for establishing safe and effective systems to treat ischemic diseases.","Gatina, Dilara Z.; Garanina, Ekaterina E.; Zhuravleva, Margarita N.; Synbulatova, Gulnaz E.; Mullakhmetova, Adelya F.; Solovyeva, Valeriya V.; Kiyasov, Andrey P.; Rutland, Catrin S.; Rizvanov, Albert A.; Salafutdinov, Ilnur I.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072943/,250

Here we introduce PtSi/porous Si Schottky junction as a room temperature large size single-electron device capable of detecting very minute changes in the electric fields and hence identifying molecules, cells, and bacteria suspended or dissolved in liquid solutions. Encouraging results for detection of healthy and cancerous human cells as well as liquids and microorganisms are provided.","Ashoori, Shiva; Raissi, Farshid; Naderpour, Maryam; Ghezelayagh, Mohammad Mahdi; Zadeh, Reza Malekabadi",Talanta,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914020310602?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33379008/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914020310602,250

The model includes both asymptomatic and presymptomatic populations with the latter leading to sickness (with recovery, hospitalization and death possibilities). We consider situations involving the application of social-distancing and other intervention measures in the time series of interest. We find optimal parametric fits to the time series of deaths (only), as well as to the time series of deaths and cumulative infections. We discuss the merits and disadvantages of each approach, we interpret the parameters of the model and assess the realistic nature of the parameters resulting from the optimization procedure. Importantly, we explore a model involving two sub-populations (younger and older than a specific age), to more accurately reflect the observed impact as concerns symptoms and behavior in different age groups. For definiteness and to separate people that are (typically) in the active workforce, our partition of population is with respect to members younger vs. older than the age of 65. The basic reproduction number of the model is computed for both the single- and the two-population variant. Finally, we consider what would be the impact of partial lockdown (involving only the older population) and full lockdown (involving the entire population) on the number of deaths and cumulative infections.","Cuevas-Maraver, J.; Kevrekidis, P.G.; Chen, Q.Y.; Kevrekidis, G.A.; Villalobos-Daniel, Víctor; Rapti, Z.; Drossinos, Y.",Math Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2021.108590; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556421000390?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785291/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556421000390,250
678454,Journal Flexibility in the Troubling Times of COVID-19.,2020-03-18,"OBJECTIVES: In February 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a guidance restricting the sales and distribution of cartridge-based e-cigarettes with flavours other than tobacco and menthol. Disposable devices were exempt from this guidance. This study examined the prevalence of disposable pod use and flavour preference compared with refillable pod and other e-cigarette users among vape shop customers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: In July 2019–March 2020, trained data collectors visited 44 vape shops in California with permission to recruit customers from shop owners. PARTICIPANTS: Intercept interviews with 276 customers were conducted. OUTCOMES AND PROCEDURES: Customers were grouped based on self-reported device type used most often (disposable pod, refillable pod and other e-cigarettes). Groups were compared on self-reported demographics, flavours preferred, daily e-cigarette use, preferred nicotine concentration levels and cigarette use. RESULTS: Of the 276 customers surveyed, 11.2% used disposable pods in the past 30 days. Among disposable pod users, fruit/candy (80.7%), mint (77.4%) and menthol (67.7%) were common preferred flavours, while tobacco flavours were less commonly preferred (19.4%). When compared with refillable pod and other non-pod e-cigarette device users, disposable pod users were younger, used higher nicotine concentration levels, were more likely to prefer mint and menthol flavours and use e-cigarettes as their first product, while less likely to ever use cigarettes and use e-cigarettes daily. DISCUSSION: Despite using higher nicotine levels and preferred menthol/mint flavours more often than users of other devices, disposable pod users reported lower prevalence of lifetime smoking and daily vaping and were younger. Given the current findings, regulations addressing non-tobacco flavours and nicotine concentration in disposable pod devices merit consideration in efforts to reduce vaping in younger adult never smokers.","Galimov, Artur; Leventhal, Adam; Meza, Leah; Unger, Jennifer B.; Huh, Jimi; Baezconde-Garbanati, Lourdes; Sussman, Steven Y",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610937/,250

680273,Research During the Pandemic: Views from Both Sides of the Fence,2021,"Abstract Transmission of viruses from the commercial poultry to wild birds is an emerging paradigm of livestock–wildlife interface. Here, we report the identification and isolation of vaccine strains of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV1) and avian coronaviruses (ACoV) from different wild bird species across eight Egyptian governorates between January 2014 and December 2015. Surveillance of avian respiratory viruses in free-ranging wild birds (n=297) identified three species that harboured or excreted APMV1 and ACoVs. Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of recovered viruses revealed a close association with the most widely utilized vaccine strains in the country. These results highlight the potential spillover of vaccine-viruses probably due to extensive use of live-attenuated vaccines in the commercial poultry, and close interaction between domesticated and wild bird populations. Further exploring the full spectrum of vaccine-derived viral vaccine strains in wild birds might help to assess the emergence of future wild-birds origin viruses.","Rohaim, M. A.; El Naggar, R.

Here, we tested whether intranasal immunization with a chitosan-hydrogel vaccine, with in situ gelling properties, extended antigen retention time within the nasal mucosa. Intranasal immunization with a chitosan-hydrogel vaccine retained antigen within the upper respiratory tract (URT), while intranasal delivery of less viscous vaccines led to antigen accumulation within the lower airways. Interestingly, sustained antigen retention within the URT following chitosan-hydrogel vaccination boosted the number of vaccine-specific, tissue resident memory (Trm) CD8(+) T cells that developed within the nasal mucosa. Mice immunized with a chitosan-hydrogel vaccine loaded with influenza virus peptides developed a large pool of influenza-specific CD8(+) nasal Trm and these cells were highly protective during an influenza challenge.

We performed a cross‐sectional, questionnaire‐based survey on 98/105 consecutive dermatological patients treated with biologics—51 suffering from plaque psoriasis, 22 from atopic dermatitis, and 25 from hidradenitis suppurativa. An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID‐19 related to (a) epidemiology, (b) pathogenesis, (c) clinical symptoms, (d) preventive measures, and (e) attitudes. Patients data and questionnaires were collected. Despite only 8.1% thought that biologics may increase the risk of COVID‐19, 18.4% and 21.4% of the patients were evaluating the possibility to discontinue or modify the dosage of the current biologic therapy, respectively. Globally, male patients (P = .001) with higher scholarity level (P = .005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID‐19. Patients with lower DLQI (P = .006), longer disease duration (P = .051) and lower scholarity (P = .007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy. At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation vs discontinuation and modification vs no modification, respectively.

METHODS: A one-step quadruplex rRT-PCR assay was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N genes, influenza A virus (hIAV) and influenza B virus (hIBV). RESULTS: The quadruplex rRT-PCR assay had good sensitivity and specificity. Correlation coefficients and amplification efficiencies of all singleplex and quadruplex rRT-PCR reactions were within acceptable ranges. The 95% lower limits of detection for plasmid standards and positive nucleic acid extracts of the quadruplex rRT-PCR assay were 57.38–95.11 copies/μL and 114.65–154.25 copies/μL, respectively. Excellent results were attained for inter- and intra-assay reproducibility. Among these clinical samples, only four samples showed results inconsistent with the singleplex rRT-PCR assays.

Antimicrobial mouthrinses are used in many clinical pre procedural situations for prophylactic purposes. An evident-based investigation for an effective mouthwash solution against salivary SARS-CoV-2 is urgently required for the exposure reduction during dental procedures. Aims. This study aimed to evaluate in vivo virucidal efficacy of 2 mouthwashes: 1% Povidone-iodine and 0.2% Chlorhexidine as a dental preprocedural oral disinfection against salivary SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods. In this randomized-controlled clinical trial, studied group comprised laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive patients through nasopharyngeal swabs. Participants were divided into 3 groups. For 30 seconds, group A gargled with 1% Povidone-iodine, group B mouthrinsed with 0.2% Chlorhexidine and control group C mouthrinsed with distilled water. Saliva samples were collected before and 5 minutes after mouthwash. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR was then performed for each sample. Evaluation of the efficacy was based on difference in Ct value. The analysis of data was carried out using GraphPad Prism version 5 for Windows. Paired t test and unpaired t test were used. A probability value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results. Sixty-one compliant participants (36 female and 25 male) with a mean age 45.3 plusmn 16.7 years-old were enrolled. A significant mean Ct value difference (p < 0.0001) between the paired samples in group A (n = 25) and also in group B (n = 27) (p < 0.0001) was found. In contrast, no significant difference (p = 0.566) existed before and after the experiment in the control group C (n = 9). Moreover, a significant difference was noted between the delta Ct of distilled water wash and each of the 2 solutions 1 % Povidone-iodine (p = 0.012) and Chlorhexidine 0.2% (p = 0.0024). No significant difference was found between the delta Ct of patients using 1% Povidone-iodine and Chlorhexidine 0.2% solutions (p = 0.24). Conclusion. Chlorhexidine 0.2% and 1% Povidone-iodine oral solutions are effective preprocedural mouthwashes against salivary SARS-COV-2 in dental treatments. Their use as a preventive strategy to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during dental practice should be systematically implemented.","ElZein, R.; Abdel Sater, f.; Fakhreddine, S.; Abi Hanna, P.; Feghali, R.; Hamad, H.; Ayoub, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.07.21252302v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.07.21252302,250

Because participants would enroll in these studies for almost completely altruistic reasons, they are owed the highest ethical standards, safeguards, and protections. This qualitative empirical ethics study sought to identify ethical and practical considerations for interventional HIV cure-related research at the EOL. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted 20 in-depth interviews and three virtual focus groups (N = 36) with four key stakeholder groups in the United States: 1) bioethicists, 2) people with HIV, 3) HIV care providers, and 4) HIV cure researchers. This study produced six key themes to guide the ethical implementation of interventional HIV cure-related research at the EOL: 1) all stakeholder groups supported this research conditioned upon a clearly delineated respect for participant contribution and autonomy, participant understanding and comprehension of the risks associated with the specific intervention(s) to be tested, and broad community support for testing of the proposed intervention(s); 2) to ensure acceptable benefit-risk profiles, researchers should focus on limiting the risks of unintended effects and minimizing undue pain and suffering at the EOL; 3) only well-vetted interventions that are supported by solid pre-clinical data should be tested in the EOL translational research model; 4) the informed consent process must be robust and include process consent; 5) research protocols should be flexible and adopt a patient/participant centered approach to minimize burdens and ensure their overall comfort and safety; and 6) a participant’s next-of-kin/loved ones should be a major focus of EOL research but only if the participant consents to such involvement. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this empirical ethics study generated the first ethical and practical considerations for interventional HIV cure-related research at the EOL. The ethical complexities of such research must be considered now. We must navigate this ethical conundrum so that we are good stewards of the participants’ extremely altruistic gifts by maximizing the impact and social value of this research.

However, fewer studies are currently available on the quantitative future epidemiological impacts. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to forecast the COVID-19 morbidities and associated-mortalities among the top 20 countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally prior to vaccination intervention. Method: We conducted a secondary data analysis of the prospective geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases data worldwide as of 10 April 2020. The historical data was forecasted using Exponential-Smoothing to detect seasonality patterns and confidence intervals surrounding each predicted value in which 95 percent of the future points are expected to fall based on the forecast. Results: The total mean forecasted cases and deaths were 99,823 and 8,801.

The present expert opinion article aimed to identify unmet needs in the management of SA in Italy, and propose possible solutions to address these needs. METHODS: At five multidisciplinary events in Italy, attendees identified factors that interfered with the effective management of SA and suggested how these barriers could be overcome. A core group of 12 Italian experts (pulmonologists, general practitioners, allergists, payers and patients) identified the main issues and proposed possible solutions based on the results from the meetings and relevant articles from the literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed the gap between real-world practice and guidelines, oral corticosteroid overuse, SA-related mortality, and barriers to effective SA treatment. Common themes were lack of awareness about SA among both patients and clinicians, and lack of networking/information exchange between those involved in the treatment of SA. Participants agreed on the need to implement patient education and create multidisciplinary groups of specialists to improve SA management through multidisciplinary educational initiatives, meetings with local experts, development of a flow chart for referral/connection with local experts and specialized centers. Clinical instruments that might help specialists improve SA management included referral networks, integrated care pathways, phenotyping and treatment algorithms, exacerbation tracking, and examination of electronic medical records for patients with uncontrolled asthma. The following actions need to be implemented in Italy: i) maximize the use of advanced therapies, eg, biologics; ii) increase/improve education for physicians and patients; iii) improve multidisciplinary communication and care coordination; iv) introduce regional and local protocols for SA diagnosis and treatment; and v) change the structure of healthcare services to reduce specialist waiting times and facilitate access to biologic therapies.","Paggiaro, Pierluigi; Barbaglia, Simona; Centanni, Stefano; Croce, Davide; Desideri, Enrico; Giustini, Saffi; Micheletto, Claudio; Musarra, Antonino; Scichilone, Nicola; Trama, Ugo; Zedda, Maria Teresa; Canonica, Giorgio Walter",J Asthma Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007186/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jaa.s293380,250

We previously generated human mAbs specific to the S1 region of SARS-CoV S protein. These mAbs bind epitopes within the receptor binding domain (RBD) or upstream of the RBD. We show that mAbs recognizing epitopes within the RBD inhibit infection by preventing viral attachment to the cellular receptor. One mAb binds upstream of the RBD and prevents viral entry by inhibiting a post-binding event. Evaluation of several mAbs demonstrated varying ability of the mAbs to select escape mutants when used individually. However, a mixture of antibodies could effectively neutralize a range of mutant viruses. These data strongly suggest that a mixture containing antibodies recognizing distinct regions and targeting more than one step in viral entry is likely to be more effective in neutralizing the virus and suppressing the generation of escape mutants, and thus potentially constitute a highly effective passive immunotherapy.","Coughlin, Melissa M.; Babcook, John; Prabhakar, Bellur S.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748648/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209004462; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209004462; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.07.028,250

We have identified a bifurcation of human B cell maturation from the T1 stage forming IgM(hi) and IgM(lo) developmental trajectories. IgM(hi) T2 cells have higher expression of α4β7 integrin and lower expression of IL-4 receptor (IL4R) compared with the IgM(lo) branch and are selectively recruited into gut-associated lymphoid tissue. IgM(hi) T2 cells also share transcriptomic features with marginal zone B cells (MZBs). Lineage progression from T1 cells to MZBs via an IgM(hi) trajectory is identified by pseudotime analysis of scRNA-sequencing data. Reduced frequency of IgM(hi) gut-homing T2 cells is observed in severe SLE and is associated with reduction of MZBs and their putative IgM(hi) precursors. The collapse of the gut-associated MZB maturational axis in severe SLE affirms its existence in health.","Tull, Thomas J.; Pitcher, Michael J.; Guesdon, William; Siu, Jacqueline H.Y.; Lebrero-Fernández, Cristina; Zhao, Yuan; Petrov, Nedyalko; Heck, Susanne; Ellis, Richard; Dhami, Pawan; Kadolsky, Ulrich D.; Kleeman, Michelle; Kamra, Yogesh; Fear, David J.; John, Susan; Jassem, Wayel; Groves, Richard W.; Sanderson, Jeremy D.; Robson, Michael D.; D’Cruz, David P.; Bemark, Mats; Spencer, Jo",J Exp Med,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20202001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538776/,250

The virus interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for invasion via receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike protein. To provide a deeper understanding of this interaction, we performed microsecond simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex for SARS- CoV-2 and compared it with the closely related SARS-CoV discovered in 2003. We show residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that were mutated from SARS-CoV, collectively help make RBD anchor much stronger to the N-terminal part of ACE2 than the corresponding residues on RBD of SARS-CoV. This would result in reduced dissociation rate of SARS-CoV-2 from human recep- tor protein compared to SARS-CoV. This phenomenon was consistently observed in simulations beyond 500 ns and was reproducible across different force fields. Altogether, our study shed light on the key residues and their dynamics at the virus spike and human receptor binding interface and advance our knowledge for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics to combat the pandemic efficiently.","Ngo, Van A.; Jha, Ramesh K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.199562,250

The resumption of in-school instruction followed a mass vaccination program using the Pfizer-BioNTech 2-dose vaccine offered under a partnership between the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to all 22,808 School District of Philadelphia employees during February 23-April 3, 2021.* The subsequent mandatory testing program provided an opportunity to assess the percentage of positive BinaxNow point-of-care antigen tests (Abbott Laboratories) identified among school staff members based on their self-reported vaccination status (i.e., received zero, 1, or 2 vaccine doses) at the time of testing. During the initial 5 weeks after schools reopened, 34,048 screening tests were performed. Overall, 0.70% of tests returned a positive result. The percentage of positive test results was lower among persons who reported receipt of 2 vaccine doses (0.09%) compared with those who reported receipt of 1 dose (1.21%) or zero doses (1.76%) (p<0.001) representing a 95% reduction in percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among persons reporting receipt of 2 compared with zero doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Vaccination of school staff members has been highlighted as an important strategy to maximize the safety of in-person education of K-12 students this fall (1).

688440,The limitations of polling data in understanding public support for COVID-19 lockdown policies,2021-07-07,"During the recent years, a lot of debate is taken place about the evolution of Smart Healthcare systems. Particularly, how these systems can help people improve human conditions of health, by taking advantages of the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), regarding early prediction and efficient treatment. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of the current literature available that focuses on information systems on syndromic surveillance using web data. All published items concern articles, books, reviews, reports, conference announcements, and dissertations. We used a variation of PRISMA Statements methodology to conduct a systematic review. The review identifies the relevant published papers from the year 2004 to 2018, systematically includes and explores them to extract similarities, gaps, and conclusions on the research that has been done so far. The results presented concern the year, the examined disease, the web data source, the geographic location/country, and the data analysis method used. The results show that influenza is the most examined infectious disease. The internet tools most used are Twitter and Google. Regarding the geographical areas explored in the published papers, the most examined country is the United States, since many scientists come from this country. There is a significant growth of articles since 2009. There are also various statistical methods used to correlate the data retrieved from the internet to the data from national authorities. The conclusion of all researches is that the Web can be a useful tool for the detection of serious epidemics and for a creation of a syndromic surveillance system using the Web, since we can predict epidemics from web data before they are officially detected in population. With the advance of ICT, Smart Healthcare can benefit from the monitoring of epidemics and the early prediction of such a system, improving national or international health strategies and policy decision. This can be achieved through the provision of new technology tools to enhance health monitoring systems toward the new innovations of Smart Health or eHealth, even with the emerging technologies of Internet of Things. The challenges and impacts of an electronic system based on internet data include the social, medical, and technological disciplines. These can be further extended to Smart Healthcare, as the data streaming can provide with real-time information, awareness on epidemics and alerts for both patients or medical scientists. Finally, these new systems can help improve the standards of human life.","Samaras, Loukas; García-Barriocanal, Elena; Sicilia, Miguel-Angel",Innovation in Health Informatics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128190432000022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128190432000022,250

With a large sample of members of Generation Z (ages 18–25, n = 1,311), I explored whether young adults talk about retirement with others; and the correlates between talking about retirement and retirement preparation. Participants reported whether they have spoken about retirement with nine sources: parents, siblings, other family members (non-parent; non-sibling), friends, significant others, co-workers, financial advisors, people on internet forums, and “other sources.” All participants reported to have discussed retirement with at least one source, with parents being the most common. Young adults’ attitudes towards retirement preparation were largely positive. For example, participants acknowledged the importance of learning about retirement and experienced more positive than negative affect when thinking about retirement. Behavioral measures of retirement preparation did not yield any effects, showing a potential gap between young adults’ retirement preparation attitudes and behavior. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the effect of retirement conversations on retirement preparation varied by source.

However, little is known about the relationship between coinfection with tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to compare the risk and survival time of death and recovery among COVID-19 patients with and without TB. Methods: We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with TB, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery comparing COVID-19 patients with and without TB. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by TB status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Results: The risk of death in COVID-19 patients among those with tuberculosis was 2.17 times greater compared to those without tuberculosis (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients among those with tuberculosis was 25% less than the risk among those without tuberculosis (RR=0.75, 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death among COVID-19 patients with TB was significantly shorter (p=0.0031) and time-to-recovery among those with TB was significantly longer than patients without TB (p=0.0046). Conclusions: Our findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increases morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

However, little is known on the relationships between anxiety resulting from persistent media exposure to coronavirus-related programs and the effects produced on working memory. In this work, a total of 101 Italian citizens (53.7% female) aged between 18 and 45 years old, who were from 14 provinces in Italy, participated in an online survey. Participants were presented with media exposure and anxiety questionnaires and they were instructed to carry out working memory tasks (visual and auditory n-back). The results showed that media exposure is related to anxiety.

690672,A Life Course Framework for Understanding Digital Technology Use in the Transition to Adulthood,2020-10-20,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic and the need for social distancing has changed the way we learn and work. Our monthly OMFS journal club has been no different and is currently being performed using the video conferencing application Microsoft Teams. The use of a virtual setting for training in Medicine and Dentistry is not new, and, like in the case of our recent move to a virtual medium, it may be that COVID-19 has resulted in fast tracking this digital transformation. There are of course disadvantages to online teaching that traditional face to face teaching overcomes. We conducted a survey to examine how trainees' attitudes and experiences have altered with this change, and to understand whether some elements of this new style of training may be advantageous in the post-pandemic world. OBJECTIVES: To assess trainee attitudes towards online teaching and which, if any, elements of this new style of training are advantageous even once face-to-face teaching becomes possible again. METHODS: A survey was created for all trainees taking part in journal club meetings at Bradford Teaching Hospitals. Questions were aimed to ascertain differences in experience between online and face-to-face settings for journal club, including multiple-choice and Likert scale questions. A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed test was used for analysis of results comparing the two settings. Responses were kept anonymous. RESULTS: Results from the survey found that the majority of trainees found it significantly easier to attend journal club after it had been moved to an online setting and also indicated that the majority of trainees found Microsoft Teams easy to use when accessing journal club, though we did not have another online application for comparison. There was no significant difference in participation comfort between the two settings, though trainees felt that the online setting significantly improved learning effectiveness. Furthermore, 78% of trainees thought that online tutorials and meetings should replace traditional face to face meetings in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The use of internet technology such as video conferencing is not a new phenomenon and although journal clubs are typically held in academic institutions, online and virtual journal clubs are flourishing. With an array of advantages, there is no shying away from the trend to move our teaching over to a virtual medium. COVID-19 may have just provided the stimulus that has forced this transformation to accelerate.","Singh Aulakh, Gurnam; Duggal, Simone; Sutton, Mr David",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0266435620304472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071050/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266435620304472?v=s5,250
