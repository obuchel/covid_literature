1329,"Acetylation regulates Cyclophilin A catalysis, immunosuppression and HIV isomerisation",2010-04-04,"Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a ubiquitous cis-trans-prolyl isomerase with key roles in immunity and viral infection. CypA suppresses T-cell activation through cyclosporine (Cs) complexation and is required for effective HIV-1 replication in host cells. We show that CypA is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyl-lysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair to produce recombinant acetylated CypA in E. coli. We determine atomic resolution structures of acetylated CypA and its complexes with Cs and HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation dramatically inhibits CypA catalysis of cis to trans isomerisation and stabilises cis rather than trans forms of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, CypA acetylation antagonizes the immunosuppressive effects of Cs, by inhibiting the sequential steps of Cs binding and calcineurin inhibition. Our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of CypA in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function.","Lammers, Michael; Neumann, Heinz; Chin, Jason W.; James, Leo C.",Nature Chemical Biology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3867001?pdf=render,455

5154,Biophysical studies of a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex binding to DNA and RNA prove that nucleic acid structure has significant effects on binding behaviors,2005-08-10,"Globule leukocytes in the epithelium of the rat trachea may be counterparts of mucosal mast cells that are located in the gastrointestinal tract. If they are indeed similar to mucosal mast cells, globule leukocytes would be expected to decrease in number in rats treated with dexamethasone but not in rats treated with compound 48/80, an agent which causes non-antigenic degranulation of connective tissue mast cells. In this study, we determined the number and compared the distribution of globule leukocytes and connective tissue mast cells in the tracheas of pathogen-free rats. We then determined whether the number of these two types of cells changes in rats treated for 5 days with compound 48/80, dexamethasone, a combination of compound 48/80 and dexamethasone, or saline. We identified globule leukocytes and mast cells in whole mounts and histological sections of rat tracheas by using a histochemical reaction that demonstrates the chymotrypsin-like protease (chloroacetate esterase) present in mast cell granules. Using this method, we found that aproximately 225000 globule leukocytes were present in the epithelium of the trachea. These cells were most abundant in the rostral trachea. Rats treated with dexamethasone had a 91% reduction in the number of globule leukocytes with protease-containing granules, but rats treated with compound 48/80 had a normal number of these cells. We found some 55000 connective tissue mast cells in the same tracheas. Mast cells were most abundant in the posterior membrane of the caudal trachea and in the lamina propria between cartilaginous rings. Rats treated with compound 48/80 had a 96% reduction in mast cells with protease-containing granules, but rats treated with dexamethasone had a normal complement of mast cells. We conclude that globule leukocytes are abundant in the tracheas of healthy rats, are similar in morphology and pharmacological responses to mucosal mast cells located in other organs of rats, and are more numerous than and have a different distribution than connective tissue mast cells. Globule leukocytes in the tracheal epithelium may have a role in respiratory defenses similar to that of mucosal mast cells in other organs.","Tam, Elizabeth K.; Calonico, Lynne D.; Nadel, Jay A.; McDonald, Donald M.",Anat Embryol (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087917/,455

The resulting products were immediately employed as substrates using influenza virus type A [(Singapore/6/86) (H1N1) or Shanghai/11/87 (H3N2)] as a source for sialidase (neuraminidase, EC 3.2.1.18). A significant increase in the percentage of sialic acid released was found when the O-acetyl group was cleaved by O-acetylesterase activity from certain substrates (bovine submandibular gland mucin, rat serum glycoproteins, human saliva glycoproteins, mouse erythrocyte stroma, chick embryonic brain gangliosides and bovine brain gangliosides). A common feature of all these substrates is that they contain N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid residues. By contrast, no significant increase in the release of sialic acid was detected when certain other substrates could not be de-O-acetylated by the action of influenza C esterase, either because they lacked O-acetylsialic acid (human glycophorin A, α(1)-acid glycoprotein from human serum, fetuin and porcine submandibular gland mucin) or because the 4-O-acetyl group was scarcely cleaved by the viral O-acetylesterase (equine submandibular gland mucin). The biological significance of these facts is discussed, relative to the infective capacity of influenza C virus.","Muñoz-Barroso, I.; García-Sastre, A.; Villar, E.; Manuguerra, J.-C.; Hannoun, C.; Cabezas, J.A.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173336/,455

13246,DGSM-Jahrestagung und Abstractband 2020,2020-10-13,"PURPOSE: Contemporary trauma resuscitation prioritizes control of bleeding and uses major haemorrhage protocols (MHPs) to prevent and treat coagulopathy. We aimed to determine whether augmenting MHPs with Viscoelastic Haemostatic Assays (VHA) would improve outcomes compared to Conventional Coagulation Tests (CCTs). METHODS: This was a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial comparing outcomes in trauma patients who received empiric MHPs, augmented by either VHA or CCT-guided interventions. Primary outcome was the proportion of subjects who, at 24 h after injury, were alive and free of massive transfusion (10 or more red cell transfusions). Secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality. Pre-specified subgroups included patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). RESULTS: Of 396 patients in the intention to treat analysis, 201 were allocated to VHA and 195 to CCT-guided therapy. At 24 h, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who were alive and free of massive transfusion (VHA: 67%, CCT: 64%, OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76–1.73). 28-day mortality was not different overall (VHA: 25%, CCT: 28%, OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54–1.31), nor were there differences in other secondary outcomes or serious adverse events. In pre-specified subgroups, there were no differences in primary outcomes. In the pre-specified subgroup of 74 patients with TBI, 64% were alive and free of massive transfusion at 24 h compared to 46% in the CCT arm (OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.84–5.34). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in overall outcomes between VHA- and CCT-augmented-major haemorrhage protocols.

15161,Mammadiagnostik: von der klinischen Diagnostik bis zur künstlichen Intelligenz,2021-02-01,"INTRODUCTION: Although patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly used in clinical practice and research, it is unclear whether these instruments cover the perspective of young people with inflammatory arthritis (IA). The aims of this study were to explore whether PROMs commonly used in IA adequately cover the perspective of young people from different European countries. METHODS: A multinational qualitative study was conducted in Austria, Croatia, Italy and the Netherlands. Young people with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), Still’s disease, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA), aged 18–35 years, participated in semistructured focus group interviews. Thematic analysis was used and data saturation was defined as no new emergent concepts in at least three subsequent focus groups. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (21 with RA/JIA/Still’s, 17 with PsA, 15 with SpA; 72% women) participated in 12 focus groups. Participants expressed a general positive attitude towards PROMs and emphasised their importance in clinical practice. In addition, 48 lower level concepts were extracted and summarised into 6 higher level concepts describing potential issues for improvement. These included: need for lay-term information regarding the purpose of using PROMs; updates of certain outdated items and using digital technology for data acquisition. Some participants admitted their tendency to rate pain, fatigue or disease activity differently from what they actually felt for various reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their general positive attitude, young people with IA suggested areas for PROM development to ensure that important concepts are included, making PROMs relevant over the entire course of a chronic disease.","Mosor, Erika; Studenic, Paul; Alunno, Alessia; Padjen, Ivan; Olsder, Wendy; Ramiro, Sofia; Bini, Ilaria; Caeyers, Nele; Gossec, Laure; Kouloumas, Marios; Nikiphorou, Elena; Stones, Simon; Wilhelmer, Tanita-Christina; Stamm, Tanja A",RMD Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849893/,455

16448,Klinische Bedeutung der Erfassung von Frailty,2021-03-29,"BACKGROUND: Up to 70% of patients report ongoing symptoms 4 weeks after hospitalisation for pneumonia; the impact on primary care is poorly understood. AIM: To investigate the frequency of primary care consultations after hospitalisation for pneumonia, and the reasons for consultation. DESIGN AND SETTING: A population-based cohort study in England using a UK primary care database of anonymised medical records (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD]) linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). METHOD: Adults with the first International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code for pneumonia (J12–J18) recorded in HES between July 2002 and June 2017 were included. Primary care consultation within 30 days of discharge was identified as the recording of any medical Read code (excluding administration-related codes) in CPRD. Competing-risks regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of consultation and antibiotic use at consultation; death and readmission were competing events. Reasons for consultation were examined. RESULTS: Of 56 396 adults, 55.9% (n = 31 542) consulted primary care within 30 days of hospital discharge. The rate of consultation was highest within 7 days (4.7 per 100 person–days). The strongest predictor for consultation was a higher number of primary care consultations in the year before index admission (adjusted subhazard ratio [sHR] 8.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.42 to 12.55). The most common reason for consultation was for a respiratory disorder (40.7%, n = 12 840), 11.8% for pneumonia specifically. At consultation, 31.1% (n = 9823) received further antibiotics. Penicillins (41.6%, n = 5753/13 829) and macrolides (21.9%, n = 3029/13 829) were the most common antibiotics prescribed. CONCLUSION: Following hospitalisation for pneumonia, a significant proportion of patients consulted primary care within 30 days, highlighting the morbidity experienced by patients during recovery from pneumonia.","Baskaran, Vadsala; Pearce, Fiona; Harwood, Rowan H; McKeever, Tricia M; Lim, Wei Shen",Br J Gen Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8007276/,455
16541,Was bewegt Lehrpersonen während der Schulschließungen? – Eine Analyse der Kommunikation im Twitter-Lehrerzimmer über Chancen und Herausforderungen digitalen Unterrichts,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Clean rooms of the Space Assembly Facility (SAF) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at NASA are the final step of spacecraft cleaning and assembly before launching into space. Clean rooms have stringent methods of air-filtration and cleaning to minimize microbial contamination for exoplanetary research and minimize the risk of human pathogens, but they are not sterile. Clean rooms make a selective environment for microorganisms that tolerate such cleaning methods. Previous studies have attempted to characterize the microbial cargo through sequencing and culture-dependent protocols. However, there is not a standardized metagenomic workflow nor analysis pipeline for spaceflight hardware cleanroom samples to identify microbial contamination. Additionally, current identification methods fail to characterize and profile the risk of low-abundance microorganisms. RESULTS: A comprehensive metagenomic framework to characterize microorganisms relevant for planetary protection in multiple cleanroom classifications (from ISO-5 to ISO-8.5) and sample types (surface, filters, and debris collected via vacuum devices) was developed. Fifty-one metagenomic samples from SAF clean rooms were sequenced and analyzed to identify microbes that could potentially survive spaceflight based on their microbial features and whether the microbes expressed any metabolic activity or growth. Additionally, an auxiliary testing was performed to determine the repeatability of our techniques and validate our analyses. We find evidence that JPL clean rooms carry microbes with attributes that may be problematic in space missions for their documented ability to withstand extreme conditions, such as psychrophilia and ability to form biofilms, spore-forming capacity, radiation resistance, and desiccation resistance. Samples from ISO-5 standard had lower microbial diversity than those conforming to ISO-6 or higher filters but still carried a measurable microbial load. CONCLUSIONS: Although the extensive cleaning processes limit the number of microbes capable of withstanding clean room condition, it is important to quantify thresholds and detect organisms that can inform ongoing Planetary Protection goals, provide a biological baseline for assembly facilities, and guide future mission planning.

16679,TMS Receives AIME Grant; Material Advantage Member Bringing MSE to the Public,2021-04-08,"Many researchers have studied the relationship between the biological functions of proteins and the structures of both their overall backbones of amino acids and their binding sites. A large amount of the work has focused on summarizing structural features of binding sites as scalar quantities, which can result in a great deal of information loss since the structures are three-dimensional. Additionally, a common way of comparing binding sites is via aligning their atoms, which is a computationally intensive procedure that substantially limits the types of analysis and modeling that can be done. In this work, we develop a novel encoding of binding sites as covariance matrices of the distances of atoms to the principal axes of the structures. This representation is invariant to the chosen coordinate system for the atoms in the binding sites, which removes the need to align the sites to a common coordinate system, is computationally efficient, and permits the development of probability models. These can then be used to both better understand groups of binding sites that bind to the same ligand and perform classification for these ligand groups. We demonstrate the utility of our method for discrimination of binding ligand through classification studies with two benchmark datasets using nearest mean and polytomous logistic regression classifiers.","Premarathna, Galkande Iresha; Ellingson, Leif",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8031081/,455

Electrocardiographic findings include patterns similar to a right bundle branch block (RBBB) and persistent ST-segment elevation in precordial leads (V1 and V2). There are numerous reports of Brugada syndrome mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infraction (STEMI); however, we describe a case of 47-year-old male who presented with STEMI mimics Brugada syndrome with preexisting RBBB. The patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia generating into ventricular fibrillation right before catheterization making the diagnosis more challenging. The patient, eventually, was found to have obstructive coronary artery disease and no evidence of abnormal sodium channelopathy on further testing. This case highlights the importance of meticulous history taking and appropriate diagnostic test in establishing proper diagnosis of STEMI in a patient with preexisting RBBB, which can mimic Brugada syndrome.","Guragai, Nirmal; Vasudev, Rahul; Shah, Dhaval; Singh, Balraj; Kaur, Parminder; Fernando, Ashen; Shamoon, Fayez; Pullatt, Raja; Joshi, Meherwan; Randhawa, Preet",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8145585/,455
18022,Ethik der Reanimation und Entscheidungen am Lebensende: Leitlinien des European Resuscitation Council 2021,2021-06-02,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections remain a health burden affecting ~250 million people worldwide. Thus far, available interferon-alpha (IFNα)-based therapies have shown unsatisfactory cure rates, and alternative therapeutic molecules are still required. However, their development has been hampered because accessible cell models supporting relevant HBV replication and appropriate antiviral activity are lacking. Strategies that reverse epigenetic alterations offer a unique opportunity for cell reprogramming, which is valuable for restoring altered cellular functions in human cell lines. This work aimed to investigate the feasibility of converting HepG2 cells that stably overexpress the HBV entry receptor (sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, NTCP) toward IFNα-responsive cells using epigenetic reprogramming. Herein, we showed that an epigenetic regimen with non-cytotoxic doses of the demethylating compound 5-azacytidine restored the anti-HBV action of IFNα in epigenetically reprogrammed HepG2-NTCP-C4 cells, named REP-HepG2-NTCP cells. Thus, a significant inhibition in HBV DNA levels was measured in REP-HepG2-NTCP cells after IFNα treatment. This inhibitory effect was associated with the enhancement of IFNα-mediated induction of critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which was limited in non-reprogrammed cells. In particular, our data indicated that re-expression of 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) was the result of an epigenetically driven unmasking of these genes in reprogrammed cells. At last, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the IFN analog CDM-3008 in REP-HepG2-NTCP cells and demonstrated the efficiency of this chemical compound in triggering ISG induction and HBV inhibition. In summary, this study shows that epigenetic reprogramming promotes the IFNα response in HBV-infected cells and is potentially attractive for cell-based experimental screening of IFN-like compounds.","Gailhouste, Luc; Sudoh, Masayuki; Qin, Xian-Yang; Watashi, Koichi; Wakita, Takaji; Ochiya, Takahiro; Matsuura, Tomokazu; Kojima, Soichi; Furutani, Yutaka",Cell Death Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170866/,455

The uncontrolled transition of fibroblasts, commonly known as myofibroblasts, are the principal source of the enormous extracellular matrix (ECM) depositing in lung parenchyma, leading to gradual failure of gas exchange and mortality of the patients. However, up to now, rare effective therapeutic strategies have been developed to blockade fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) in IPF. Method: We illustrated that the lungs originated from IPF patients and mice with pulmonary fibrosis are characterized by the overexpression of sushi-repeat-containing protein, X-linked 2 (SRPX2). Further functionality studies identified the pivotal role of SRPX2 in FMT. Mechanistically, SRPX2 was involved in a TGFβR1/SMAD3/SRPX2/AP1/SMAD7 positive feedback loop. Specifically, SRPX2 was upregulated by TGF-β1 in a TGFβR1/SMAD3-dependent manner, after which SRPX2 in turn repressed the expression of AP1, subsequently minimized SMAD7 expression, through which it reduced the formation of inhibitory complex with TGFβR1 and enhanced SMAD signaling pathway to promote FMT and exacerbate pulmonary fibrosis. Notably, intratracheal administration of siRNA-loaded liposomes could effectively suppress the expression of Srpx2 in the lung and remarkably protect mice against BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, concomitant with a significant reduction of FMT. Results: Accordingly, these data indicate that Srpx2 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and suggests the strategy aiming at silencing Srpx2 could be a promising therapeutic approach against pulmonary fibrosis in clinical settings.","Wang, Qi; Liu, Juan; Hu, Yinan; Pan, Ting; Xu, Yongjian; Yu, Jun; Xiong, Weining; Zhou, Qing; Wang, Yi",Theranostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8171094/,455

21340,Diagnostisches und therapeutisches Vorgehen bei Sarkopenie,2021-09-20,"BACKGROUND: Ineffective linkage to care (LTC) is a known challenge for community HIV testing. To overcome this challenge, a robust linkage to care strategy was adopted by the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS). The NAIIS linkage to care strategy was further adapted to improve Nigeria’s programmatic efforts to achieve the 1(st) 90 as part of the Nigeria Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Surge initiative, which also included targeted community testing. In this paper we provide an overview of the NAIIS LTC strategy and describe the impact of this strategy on both the NAIIS and the Surge initiatives. METHODS: The NAIIS collaborated with community-based organizations (CBOs) and deployed mobile health (mHealth) technology with real-time dashboards to manage and optimize community LTC for people living with HIV (PLHIV) diagnosed during the survey. In NAIIS, CBOs’ role was to facilitate linkage of identified PLHIV in community to facility of their choice. For the ART Surge, we modified the NAIIS LTC strategy by empowering both CBOs and mobile community teams as responsible for not only active LTC but also for community testing, ART initiation, and retention in care. RESULTS: Of the 2,739 PLHIV 15 years and above identified in NAIIS, 1,975 (72.1%) were either unaware of their HIV-positive status (N = 1890) or were aware of their HIV-positive status but not receiving treatment (N = 85). Of these, 1,342 (67.9%) were linked to care, of which 952 (70.9%) were initiated on ART. Among 1,890 newly diagnosed PLHIV, 1,278 (67.6%) were linked to care, 33.7% self-linked and 66.3% were linked by CBOs. Among 85 known PLHIV not on treatment, 64 (75.3%) were linked; 32.8% self-linked and 67.2% were linked by a CBO. In the ART Surge, LTC and treatment initiation rates were 98% and 100%, respectively. Three-month retention for monthly treatment initiation cohorts improved from 76% to 90% over 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Active LTC strategies by local CBOs and mobile community teams improved LTC and ART initiation in the ART Surge initiative. The use of mHealth technology resulted in timely and accurate documentation of results in NAIIS. By deploying mHealth in addition to active LTC, CBOs and mobile community teams could effectively scale up ART with real-time documentation of client-level outcomes.","Jahun, Ibrahim; Said, Ishaq; El-Imam, Ibrahim; Ehoche, Akipu; Dalhatu, Ibrahim; Yakubu, Aminu; Greby, Stacie; Bronson, Megan; Brown, Kristin; Bamidele, Moyosola; Boyd, Andrew T.; Bachanas, Pamela; Dirlikov, Emilio; Agbakwuru, Chinedu; Abutu, Andrew; Williams-Sherlock, Michelle; Onotu, Denis; Odafe, Solomon; Williams, Daniel B.; Bassey, Orji; Ogbanufe, Obinna; Onyenuobi, Chibuzor; Adeola, Ayo; Meribe, Chidozie; Efuntoye, Timothy; Fagbamigbe, Omodele J.; Fagbemi, Ayodele; Ene, Uzoma; Nguhemen, Tingir; Mgbakor, Ifunanya; Alagi, Matthias; Asaolu, Olugbenga; Oladipo, Ademola; Amafah, Joy; Nzelu, Charles; Dakum, Patrick; Mensah, Charles; Aliyu, Ahmad; Okonkwo, Prosper; Oyeledun, Bolanle; Oko, John; Ikpeazu, Akudo; Gambo, Aliyu; Charurat, Manhattan; Ellerbrock, Tedd; Aliyu, Sani; Swaminathan, Mahesh",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8451986/,455

24261,Die Gesellschaft Deutscher Neurologen und Psychiater im Zweiten Weltkrieg,2016,"This chapter is an attempt to integrate recent studies concerning the role of chemokine receptors in the initiation, development, and maintenance of allergic lung diseases collectively referred to as asthma. The pathogenesis of asthma involves the coordinated trafficking of inflammatory cells to the lungs and draining lymph nodes, as well as the activation of these inflammatory cells. Chemokine receptors and their ligands play a prominent role in directing the inflammation associated with allergic lung disease. T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses can be broadly categorized as being type 1 or type 2, based on the cell types present and the associated cytokines produced. Allergic lung disease is a predominately type 2-mediated disease. The chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR6, and CCR8 serve to promote the recruitment of type 2 T (T helper 2; Th2) cells, whereas CXCR3 antagonizes type 2 and promotes type 1 T (T helper 1; Th1) cells. The pathophysiologic manifestations of asthma, including excessive mucus production, eosinophilia, and airway hyperreactivity, are dependent upon the trafficking and activation of eosinophils, mast cells, and goblet cells. Roles for chemokine receptors, including CCR4, CCR2, and CXCR4, in the trafficking and activation of these cell types during allergic lung disease are discussed. Finally, the incidence of allergic lung disease is increasing, and the costs associated with it are substantial. Chemokine receptor expression and use by inflammatory cells during allergic lung disease makes chemokine receptors an attractive therapeutic target. Implications for drug development are discussed in the context of experimental results.","Lindell, Dennis M.; Lukacs, Nicholas W.",The Chemokine Receptors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120523/,455

Topics discussed include data imputation, semi-supervised labelling and synthetic instance simulation when using sparse training data. Innovative semi-supervised ensemble learning paradigms are proposed focusing on labelling threshold selection and stringency of classification confidence levels. A regression-correlation combination (RCC) data imputation method is also introduced for handling of partially complete training data. Results presented in this work show data imputation precision improvement over benchmark value replacement using proposed RCC on 70% of test cases. Proposed novel incremental transductive models such as ITSVM have provided interesting findings based on threshold constraints outperforming standard SVM application on 21% of test cases and can be applied with alternative environment-based epidemic disease domains. The proposed incremental transductive ensemble approach model enables the combination of complimentary algorithms to provide labelling for unlabelled vector density instances. Liberal (LTA) and strict training approaches provided varied results with LTA outperforming Stacking ensemble on 29.1% of test cases.

However, in a given application, it is often hard to select an optimal shape of the kernel. This is why, in practice, it may be useful to possess efficient tools to perform a robustness analysis, talking the form in our case of an imprecise convolution. When convolution kernels are positive, their formal equivalence with probability distributions allows one to use imprecise probability theory to achieve such an imprecise convolution. However, many kernels can have negative values, in which case the previous equivalence does not hold anymore. Yet, we show mathematically in this paper that, while the formal equivalence is lost, the computational tools used to describe sets of probabilities by intervals on the singletons still retain their key properties when used to approximate sets of (possibly) non-positive kernels. We then illustrate their use on a single application that consists of filtering a human electrocardiogram signal by using a low-pass filter whose order is imprecisely known. We show, in this experiment, that the proposed approach leads to tighter bounds than previously proposed approaches.","Destercke, Sébastien; Rico, Agnès; Strauss, Olivier",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274772/,455

35158,"Xylem Inc, USA",2020-06-22,"Next Point of Interest (POI) recommendation is an important aspect of information feeds for Location Based Social Networks (LSBNs). The boom in LSBN platforms such as Foursquare, Twitter, and Yelp has motivated a considerable amount of research focused on POI recommendations within the last decade. Inspired by the success of deep neural networks in many fields, researchers are increasingly interested in using neural networks such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to make POI recommendation. Compared to traditional methods like Factorizing Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) and Tensor Factorization (TF), neural network methods show great improvement in general sequences prediction. However, the user’s personal preference, which is crucial for personalized POI recommendation, is not addressed well in existing works. Moreover, the user’s personal preference is dynamic rather than static, which can guide predictions in different temporal and spatial contexts. To this end, we propose a new deep neural network model called Personal Dynamic Preference Neural Network(PDPNN). The core of the PDPNN model includes two parts: one part learns the user’s personal long-term preferences from the historical trajectories, and the other part learns the user’s short-term preferences from the current trajectory. By introducing a similarity function that evaluates the similarity between spatiotemporal contexts of user’s current trajectory and historical trajectories, PDPNN learns the user’s personal dynamic preference from user’s long-term and short-term preferences. We conducted experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results show that our model outperforms current well-known methods.","Zhong, Jinwen; Ma, Can; Zhou, Jiang; Wang, Weiping",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304688/,455

Coronavirus is the agent that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and emergent infections such as the present pandemic of COVID-19. Understanding its genome pattern is important for developing new and faster ways of testing for identifying the genome of the virus and also for better understanding of its origin and evolution. METHODS: For that, it was calculated the alpha coefficient by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) for the sequences of these genomes converted to binary numbers in order to determine if it is a chaotic or a random series of data. Also, it applied the random walking for obtaining a fractal map of the whole genome and calculated the fractal dimension (FD) by box-counting of this map by two different software. RESULTS: With this, it was found that the alpha coefficient of the first SARS viruses was > 0.5, indicating that the series is chaotic or fractal, and has a persistent long-range memory or self-similarity along its sequence. This is not the case for MERS virus, which showed to have a completely random sequence (α < 0.5). For the fractal dimension, SARS viruses presented a FD around 1.5, and for MERS the fractal dimension decreases (FD < 1.5). CONCLUSION: The images generated by random walking of the entire RNA genome are by itself a fractal signature of the virus, which may be applied for studying its origin and for faster diagnostic of COVID-19.","de Salazar e Fernandes, Thiago; de Oliveira Filho, Jonas Sérgio; da Silva Lopes, Isvania Maria Serafim",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7320653/,455

More generally, the relationships between various forms of event structures and suitable forms of nets have been long established. Good examples are the close relationship between inhibitor event structures and inhibitor occurrence nets, or between asymmetric event structures and asymmetric occurrence nets. Several forms of event structures suited for the modelling of reversible computation have recently been developed; also a method for reversing occurrence nets has been proposed. This paper bridges the gap between reversible event structures and reversible nets. We introduce the notion of reversible occurrence net, which is a generalisation of the notion of reversible unfolding.

This trend is also visible in the embedded and real-time domain, where programmers are forced to parallelize their software to keep deadlines. Additionally, embedded systems rely increasingly on modular applications, that can easily be adapted to different system loads and hardware configurations. To parallelize applications under these dynamic conditions, often dispatching frameworks like Threading Building Blocks (TBB) are used in the desktop and server segment. More recently, Embedded Multicore Building Blocks (EMB[Formula: see text]) was developed as a task-based programming solution designed with the constraints of embedded systems in mind. In this paper, we discuss how task-based programming fits such systems by analyzing scheduler implementation variants, with a focus on classic work-stealing and the libraries TBB and EMB[Formula: see text]. Based on the state of the art we introduce a novel resource-trading concept that allows static memory allocation in a work-stealing runtime holding strict space and time bounds. We conduct benchmarks between an early prototype of the concept, TBB and EMB[Formula: see text], showing that resource-trading does not introduce additional runtime overheads, while unfortunately also not improving on execution time variances.","Fritz, Florian; Schmid, Michael; Mottok, Jürgen",Architecture of Computing Systems - ARCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343420/,455

Study 1 was a pilot randomized control trial of sitting (breath-and-body) meditation vs. compassion meditation that provided preliminary support for the mindfulness hypothesis. Study 2 was set up to rule out the possibility that the meditation effects observed in Study 1 were the effects of repeated measures. An inactive control group of participants underwent the repeated measures of empathic concern with no meditation in between. The pre-post comparison demonstrated no significant changes in the measures. Thus, the results of two studies supported the mindfulness hypothesis. Limitations of the present study and future research directions are discussed.

The respiratory belt, compared with the other human respiratory data measurement methods, has the advantages of being portable, cheap, non-invasive, etc. However, it is unclear which features of the breathing data can effectively classify the normal/abnormal state of breathing state. To solve the problem, we proposed a novel approach based on long-short-term-memory (LSTM) and breathing features of respiratory data. First, LSTM structure were used, then compared the result with the traditional method which extract the feature to experiment (in our paper which is RIE (ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time)). In the end, a novel methodology proposed which combined the RIE feature with the LSTM structure. Experiment the three methods above using 342 normal and abnormal 24-h breathing data, the results show that the third method has higher classification accuracy.","Chen, Jinlong; Jiang, Mengke",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354828/,455

In this problem, the input is a directed n vertex graph and the set of source destination pair of vertices. The goal is to find the maximum number of paths connecting each such pair, so that such discovered paths are node-disjoint. In this paper, a novel Canine Inspired Algorithm is proposed which is a bio-inspired one, based on the olfactory capabilities of canines in tracing and reaching a destination. Currently many of the existing algorithms try to identify disjoint paths in a linear manner, whereas the Canine algorithm can be executed in a concurrent manner, depending on the number of canines deployed to find the disjoint paths. The time complexity of the algorithm is estimated to be [Formula: see text] . We hope that this algorithm finds many applications in problems related to various fields such as communication networks, scheduling and transportation and provides better results.","Ananthalakshmi Ammal, R.; Sajimon, P.

Optimum usage of resource is the only way out to handle this situation. Among the various water resources the most controllable one is the dam reservoirs. This paper deals with optimal reservoir optimization using multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Various parameters like reservoir storage capacity, spill loss, evaporation rate, water used for irrigation, water used for electricity production, rate of inflow, outflow all need to be managed in an optimal way so that water levels are managed and resource specifications are met. This is normally managed using a software, but sudden change in scenarios and change in requirements cannot be handled by such softwares. Hence we are incorporating an optimised software layer to handle such situation. Multi objective genetic algorithm was able to optimise the water usage within the usage constrains. The results were assessed based on reliability, vulnerability and resilience indices. In addition, based on a multi-criteria decision-making model, it was evaluated by comparing it with other evolutionary algorithms. The simulated result shows that MOGA derived rules are promising and competitive and can be effectively used for reservoir optimization operations.","S S, Vinod Chandra; Anand Hareendran, S.; S, Saju Sankar",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354833/,455

36804,STMC: Statistical Model Checker with Stratified and Antithetic Sampling,2020-06-16,"The Covid-19 pandemic and the social distancing that followed have affected all walks of society, also education. In order to keep education running, educational institutions have had to quickly adapt to the situation. This has resulted in an unprecedented push to online learning. Many, including commercial digital learning platform providers, have rushed to provide their support and ‘solutions’, sometimes for free. The Covid-19 pandemic has therefore also created a sellers’ market in ed-tech. This paper employs a critical lens to reflect on the possible problems arising from hasty adoption of commercial digital learning solutions whose design might not always be driven by best pedagogical practices but their business model that leverages user data for profit-making. Moreover, already before Covid-19, there has been increasing critique of how ed-tech is redefining and reducing concepts of teaching and learning. The paper also challenges the narrative that claims, ‘education is broken, and it should and can be fixed with technology’. Such technologization, often seen as neutral, is closely related to educationalization, i.e. imposing growing societal problems for education to resolve. Therefore, this is a critical moment to reflect how the current choices educational institutions are making might affect with Covid-19 education and online learning: Will they reinforce capitalist instrumental view of education or promote holistic human growth? This paper urges educational leaders to think carefully about the decisions they are currently making and if they indeed pave the way to a desirable future of education.","Teräs, Marko; Suoranta, Juha; Teräs, Hanna; Curcher, Mark",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355515/,455

In general, the stock market times series present high volatility due to its sensitivity to economic and political factors. Furthermore, recently, the covid-19 pandemic has caused a drastic change in the stock exchange times series. In this challenging context, several computational techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of predicting such times series. The main goal of this article is to compare the prediction performance of five neural network architectures in predicting the six most traded stocks of the official Brazilian stock exchange B3 from March 2019 to April 2020. We trained the models to predict the closing price of the next day using as inputs its own previous values. We compared the predictive performance of multiple linear regression, Elman, Jordan, radial basis function, and multilayer perceptron architectures based on the root of the mean square error. We trained all models using the training set while hyper-parameters such as the number of input variables and hidden layers were selected using the testing set. Moreover, we used the trimmed average of 100 bootstrap samples as our prediction. Thus, our approach allows us to measure the uncertainty associate with the predicted values. The results showed that for all times series, considered all architectures, except the radial basis function, the networks tunning provide suitable fit, reasonable predictions, and confidence intervals.","Teixeira Zavadzki de Pauli, Suellen; Kleina, Mariana; Bonat, Wagner Hugo",Ann,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355518/,455

Burnout is thought to develop from occupational stress while compassion fatigue results from being in a caregiver role leading to inability to get engaged in a caring relation. The objective of the current study was to investigate research trends, themes, citations, and key players of publications on burnout and compassion fatigue among healthcare providers. METHODS: A validated search query was developed and implemented in the Scopus database. The study period was all times up to 2019. RESULTS: Research query found 4416 publications. Publications started in 1978. Steep growth in the number of publications was observed in the last decade. There were seven research themes in the retrieved publications; six for burnout and one for compassion fatigue. Approximately 36% of the retrieved publications were about nurses; 36% were about physicians, 10% were about medical residents and the remaining did not include a specific profession. The retrieved publications received an average of 22.2 citations per article. Four of the top 10 active journals were in the field of nursing and two in the field of general medicine, one in public health, one in neurology, one in psychology, and one was multidisciplinary. The USA ranked first with 1292 (29.3%) articles followed by Spain (n = 248; 5.6%) and the UK (n = 247; 5.6%). Mayo Clinic was the most active institution (n = 93; 2.1%) followed by Harvard University (n = 46; 1.0%) and University of Washington, Seattle (n = 45; 1.0%).

RECENT FINDINGS: The number of DCD LTs performed annually within the USA has continued to grow on an annual basis. Importantly, national data has demonstrated that outcomes with DCD LT have been improving. This improvement has been driven by better understanding of how to successfully utilize these organs through better donor and recipient matching and careful evaluation of both hemodynamics during withdrawal of life support and the refinement of the procurement operation. SUMMARY: Despite these improvements in outcome, ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) continues to be the Achilles heel of DCD LT.

Previous studies have shown that lycorine exerts a anti-inflammatory effect. However, whether lycorine alleviates lung injury remains unclear. To explore this issue, BALB/c mice and MLE-12 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish lung injury mouse model and cell model, respectively. Glycyrrhizic acid, known as an inhibitor of ALI, was also used to study the effects of lycorine in vitro. Our results showed that after LPS treatment, the lung injury score, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and malondialdehyde (MDA) production in the lung tissues and the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly increased, whereas their levels were decreased by lycorine. Additionally, LPS injection activated the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)/Toll-like receptors (TLRs)/NF-κB pathway. However, lycorine treatment attenuated the activity of the HMGB1/TLRs/NF-κB pathway in the lung tissues. In vitro studies showed that lycorine administration significantly decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines and MDA and attenuated the activity of the HMGB1/TLRs/NF-κB pathway in LPS-treated cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of lycorine on the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in LPS-treated lung cells were similar with that of glycyrrhizic acid, and this inhibition was intensified by both lycorine and glycyrrhizic acid treatment. We suggest that lycorine could alleviate LPS-induced lung injury of inflammation and oxidative stress by blocking the HMGB1/TLRs/NF-κB pathway, which gives a new perspective for ALI therapy to treat lycorine as a potential treatment clinically.","Ge, Xin; Meng, Xianglin; Fei, Dongsheng; Kang, Kai; Wang, Qiubo; Zhao, Mingyan",3 Biotech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395800/,455

Referral from smaller peripheral hospitals to higher centers for intensive care is common. However, lack of an organized referral and feedback system compromises optimal care. We studied the quality of referral letters coming to our Emergency Department (ED) with respect to their demography, association with severity of illness and mortality before and after referral education. METHODS: Our study was completed in three phases in the Pediatric ED; Pre-intervention, Intervention and Post intervention phases. Quality of referral letter was matched with a quality checklist proforma and graded as ‘good’, ‘fair’ and ‘poor’ if it scored > 7, 5–7 and < 5 points respectively. A peer reviewed referral education module was prepared using case studies, expert opinions, and lacunae observed in the first phase and administered to health care providers (HCP’s) of referring hospitals. Quality of referral letter was compared between pre and post intervention phases. RESULTS: Most referrals belonged to the neighboring states of Punjab (48.2%) and Haryana (22.4%). Major referring hospitals were from public sector (80.9%), of which the teaching hospitals topped the list (53.6%). Government run ambulance services (85.5%) was commonest mode of transport used and need for a PICU bed and/or mechanical ventilation (50.4%) was the commonest reason for referral. The post intervention phase saw a significant decline in the proportion of poor (93.2 vs.78.2%; p = 0.001) and a significant increase in the proportion of fair (6.1 vs 18%; p = 0.001) and good referral letters (0.7 vs 18%; p = 0.001). The proportion of children with physiological decompensation at triage had reduced significantly in the post intervention phase [513 out of 1403 (36.5%) vs. 310 out of 957 (32.3%); p = 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Referral education had significantly improved the quality of referral letters. Proportion of children with physiological decompensation at triage had decreased significantly after referral module. This change suggests sensitization of the peripheral hospitals towards a better referral process. Continued multifaceted approach will be required for sustained and increased benefits.","Ezhumalai, Gopalakrishnan; Jayashree, Muralidharan; Nallasamy, Karthi; Bansal, Arun; Bharti, Bhavneet",BMC Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7430091/,455

However, everyday life has been dramatically affected by highly restrictive government-imposed measures such as stay-at-home curfews, prohibitions on mobility across national and county boundaries, and strict policing, especially of the urban poor, which has culminated in violence. This open letter highlights the effects of these measures on how three community-based organizations (CBOs) deliver HIV programs and services to highly stigmatized communities of men who have sex with men living in the counties of Kisumu, Kiambu and Mombasa. In particular, emphasis is placed on how HIV testing programs, which are supported by systematic peer outreach, are being disrupted at a time when global policymakers call for expanded HIV testing and treatment targets among key populations. While government measures have greatly undermined local efforts to deliver health services to members and strengthen existing HIV testing programs, each of the three CBOs has taken innovative steps to adapt to the government restrictions and to the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Although HIV testing in clinical spaces among those who were once regular and occasional program attendees dropped off noticeably in the early months of the COVID-19 lockdown, the program eventually began to rebound as outreach approaches shifted to virtual platforms and strategies. Importantly and unexpectedly, HIV self-testing kits proved to fill a major gap in clinic-based HIV testing at a time of crisis.","Odinga, Manas Migot; Kuria, Samuel; Muindi, Oliver; Mwakazi, Peter; Njraini, Margret; Melon, Memory; Kombo, Bernadette; Kaosa, Shem; Kioko, Japtheth; Musimbi, Janet; Musyoki, Helgar; Bhattacharjee, Parinita; Lorway, Robert",Gates Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477340/,455
39421,Theory of Leakage Preventing Layer,2013-08-14,"In the spring of 2020, brick and mortar colleges had to abruptly adapt to the reality of COVID-19 and transition to entirely online environments in a manner of weeks. This required a rapid (< 2 weeks) acquisition of knowledge and flexibility in using technology, most commonly Zoom. Upon completion of the semester, and after debriefing with numerous faculty teaching required courses across the biomedical engineering department at ____ University, the most common comments were that the online engagement and the online environment were nothing close to the traditional classroom environment: students were less likely to show up; less likely to enable their cameras so you could see their faces; and less likely to ask or answer questions in class. To address these issues, in this paper we make easily implementable recommendations that will increase engagement and improve the inclusivity of online courses that can be applied to any biomedical engineering course offered in an online environment.

The four recommendations for improving the engagement in the online classroom are: (1) make it a priority to stress the importance of having their cameras on during lecture and explain why it’s important; (2) have a “Daily Question” at the start of lecture where all students respond in chat followed by a brief discussion; (3) make use of the polling feature in Zoom to frequently assess student understanding and upon discovering student confusion on any given question, send them to breakout rooms to discuss, incorporating a quick active learning exercise that can help reduce the monotony of online lecture; and (4) create handouts that are circulated prior to class for students to take different pieces of a particular problem, solve them in their teams in individual breakout rooms, and then discuss the content and results back in class with all teams together. These techniques were shown to increase engagement and attendance and fostered a welcoming environment in the online classroom, contributing positively to student experience and in turn allowing students to achieve student learning outcomes despite the difficult circumstances.

39422,Local Clean Area,2013-08-08,"Coworking spaces have become a central component of new work environments, with large international chains. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether user preferences for the physical workspace design are consistent across countries, which the uniformity of such chains seems to suggest. A comparison between the user preferences of coworking spaces between the Netherlands (n = 219), Germany (n = 98) and the Czech Republic (n = 79) is performed using a mixed multinomial logic model for each country. Besides statistical utility of attributes, also motivations for working in coworking spaces are analysed. The findings show that there are some consistencies in preferences across countries. Typical real estate characteristics like accessibility and contract options came forward to be the most important attributes in choosing which coworking space to work at in all three countries. However, significant differences in the desired quality levels of specifically these attributes were found between the countries as well, and only the less important attributes showed similar preferences internationally. This suggests that identical world-wide implementations of the same concept, might serve multi-nationals but possibly will not attract local users. The identified differences in preferences can help to position more specific, dedicated coworking spaces within local markets.","Appel-Meulenbroek, Rianne; Weijs-Perrée, Minou; Orel, Marko; Gauger, Felix; Pfnür, Andreas",Rev Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7497231/,455

METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP, five guideline databases, and four online book malls to identify ICWM CGs published up to January 11, 2019. Four independent appraisers assessed the quality of CGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument and evaluated six specific concerns for ICWM. The standardized scores were calculated for the individual AGREE II domains. RESULTS: Sixty-two ICWM CGs were included. The median standardized scores in the six domains of AGREE II were 65% in scope and purpose, 46% in clarity of presentation, 26% in applicability, 24% in stakeholder involvement, 15% in rigor of development, and 0% in editorial independence. The quality of ICWM CGs was significantly associated with the publication year (higher quality for CGs published after 2014) and the development method (higher quality for evidence-based CGs). Only one ICWM CG obtained a direct recommendation for use, and 14 could be recommended for use after modifications. The intra-appraiser consistency of the AGREE II appraisal was good (mean intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.813–0.998). ICWM CGs also lacked a systematic search of ancient traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) classics (40.3%), conversion of TCM recommendations from ancient Chinese to the vernacular (14.5%), a discussion of interactions between TCM and Western medicine (27.4%), and rankings of different ICWM choices (0%). CONCLUSIONS: Although an improvement after 2014 occurred, the current 64 ICWM CGs are generally of poor methodological quality. Only 15 ICWM CGs can be recommended for use directly or with modifications. As the key distinctions from Western/Chinese medicine CGs, the ICWM-specific recommendations are also insufficient for the ICWM CGs, especially for interactions between TCM and Western medicine and rankings of different ICWM choices.

However, in tertiary units, the transfer of patients who are not in need of highly specialized care is often necessary. The aim of this study was to assess the association between a 90-day mortality and inter-hospital transfer due to a shortage of ICU beds in a tertiary centre. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the local ICU database from December 2011 to September 2019. The primary analysis was a risk-adjusted logistic regression model. Secondary analyses comprised case/control (transfer/non-transfer) matching. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients were transferred due to a shortage of ICU beds, and 8106 patients were not transferred. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients transferred due to a shortage of beds (189 patients (33%) vs 2188 patients (27%), p = 0.002). In the primary, risk-adjusted analysis, the risk of death at 90 days was similar between the groups (odds ratio 0.923, 95% confidence interval 0.75–1.14, p = 0.461). In the secondary analyses, a 90-day mortality was similar in transferred and non-transferred patients matched according to SAPS 3-score, age, days in the ICU and ICU diagnosis (p = 0.407); SOFA score on the day of discharge, ICU diagnosis and age (p = 0.634); or in a propensity score model (p = 0.229). CONCLUSION: Mortality at 90 days in critically ill patients treated in a tertiary centre was not affected by transfer to another intensive care units due to a shortage of beds. We found this conclusion to be valid under the assumption that patients are carefully selected and that the transports are safely performed.

The problem is that the breeding of livestock for fast growth or high yields of meat is often associated with illness and microbial infection that develop under the breeding conditions. Piglet diarrhea is most common pig disease, leading to heavy mortality and thereby economic loss. We proved that chemical drugs can relieve the symptoms of diarrhea in ill piglets, but they do not treat the underlying cause, i.e. significantly altered bacterial gut flora. Using Illumina sequencing of fecal DNA, we showed that the bacterial gut flora of piglets treated with antibiotics remain close to the ill conditions. However, using Illumina sequencing of fecal DNA from piglets treated with a specific Bacillus (Bacillus subtilis Y-15, B. amyloliquefaciens DN6502 and B. licheniformis SDZD02) demonstrated the efficiency of natural bioproducts not only on curing diarrhea, but also on beneficial bacteria to re-establish in the piglet gut. We therefore propose a new natural “medicine” to be explored by the world farm animal agriculture industry, particularly for sustainable improvement of swine livestock production and health.","Yue, Shousong; Li, Zhentian; Hu, Fuli; Picimbon, Jean-François",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7656456/,455

Besides, the polynomial regression model has been used for predictions of COVID‐19 affected population and related deaths. The study found positive spatial heterogeneity in COVID‐19 cases in India. The study has also identified seventeen epicentres across the country with high incidence rates. The directional distribution of ellipse polygon shows that the spread of COVID‐19 now trending towards the east but the concentration of cases is mainly in the western part of the country. The country's trend of COVID‐19 follows a fourth‐order polynomial growth and is characterized by an increasing trend.

Prior preterm delivery, it remains uncertain whether ACS treatment should be continued if possible (repeated course ACS), until a certain gestational age is reached. We hypothesized that the association of single-course ACS with feeding competence and postnatal growth outcomes might be different from that of repeated course ACS in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants born at 23–37 weeks’ gestation in South China from 2011 to 2014. Data on growth, nutritional and clinical outcomes were collected. Repeated course ACS was defined in this study as two or more courses ACS (more than single-course). Infants were stratified by gestational age (GA), including GA < 28 weeks, 28 weeks ≤ GA < 32 weeks and 32 weeks ≤ GA < 37 weeks. Multiple linear regression and multilevel model were applied to analyze the association of ACS with feeding and growth outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 841 infants were recruited. The results, just in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants born at 28–32 weeks’ gestation, showed both single and repeated course of ACS regimens had shorter intubated ventilation time compared to non-ACS regimen. Single-course ACS promoted the earlier application of amino acid and enteral nutrition, and higher rate of weight increase (15.71; 95%CI 5.54–25.88) than non-ACS after adjusting for potential confounding factors. No associations of repeated course ACS with feeding, mean weight and weight increase rate were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Single-course ACS was positively related to feeding and growth outcomes in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants born at 28–32 weeks’ gestation. However, the similar phenomenon was not observed in the repeated course of ACS regimen.","Jing, Jiajia; Dai, Yiheng; Li, Yanqi; Zhou, Ping; Li, Xiaodong; Mei, Jiaping; Zhang, Chunyi; Sangild, Per Trop; Tang, Zhaoxie; Xu, Suhua; Su, Yanbin; He, Xiaoying; Zhu, Yanna",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801876/,455

The purpose of this opinion paper is to uncover and analyse the potential of such agreements for a circular economy. Circular agreements aim at increasing the circulation of materials and are an emerging form of political governance within the EU. These agreements have different names, involve different actors and govern in different ways. However, circular agreements seem to work when other types of regulations fail to establish circulation. These agreements bring actors together and offer a platform for negotiating how advantages and disadvantages can be redistributed between actors in a way that is more suitable for a circular economy. However, circular agreements are dependent on other policy instruments to work and can generate a free-rider problem with uninvolved actors. The agreements may also become too detailed and long term, which leads to problem shifting and lock-ins, respectively.","Johansson, Nils",Circ.Econ.Sust.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870356/,455

Only emergent ENT surgeries should be done in an operating room having a negative pressure environment with high-frequency air changes, and all staff must wear personal protective equipment. The anesthetist intubates the patient while the surgical team waits outside the operation theater post-intubation for 21 min. For otology surgery, double draping of the microscope should be done; for rhinology surgery, concept of negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system should be used. Smoke evacuation system is set up inside the tent to evacuate any smoke produced during the surgery. Tracheostomy should be done at least after 10 days of mechanical ventilation with cuffed, non-fenestrated tracheal tube inserted through the tracheal window, and a separate closed suction system is used for suctioning. After the surgery is completed, disposal of PPE kit needs to be done according to local guidelines. After completion of the surgery, the full anesthesia unit should be disinfected for 2 h with 12 % hydrogen peroxide. Chlorine-containing disinfectant (2000 mg/L) is used to clean the floor of the operation theater and clean all the reusable medical equipment. Ultra-low volume 20 to 30 mL/m of 3% hydrogen peroxide is used to fumigate the OT for 2 h. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a newly discovered infectious disease. Measures need to be taken to prevent transmission and attain a plateau and decline in the disease. Otorhinolaryngologists and head neck surgeons are at high risk of this infection. This review summarizes the protocol for otorhinolaryngologists and head neck surgeons caring for patients in this current scenario. Protocols need to be strictly followed to prevent the spread of this disease.","Juvekar, Meenesh; Sarkar, Baisali",Egypt J Otolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7887715/,455
46362,Willkommen bei der Impflotterie,2021-03-09,"This report of the EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2019 in 36 European countries (28 Member States (MS) and eight non‐MS). The first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (flat) during 2015–2019. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis acquired in the EU was similar to that in 2017–2018. Of the 26 MS reporting on Salmonella control programmes in poultry, 18 met the reduction targets, whereas eight failed to meet at least one. The EU prevalence of Salmonella target serovar‐positive flocks has been stable since 2015 for breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys, with fluctuations for breeding turkey flocks. Salmonella results from competent authorities for pig carcases and for poultry tested through national control programmes were more frequently positive than those from food business operators. Shiga toxin‐producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection was the third most reported zoonosis in humans and increased from 2015 to 2019. Yersiniosis was the fourth most reported zoonosis in humans in 2019 with a stable trend in 2015–2019. The EU trend of confirmed listeriosis cases remained stable in 2015–2019 after a long period of increase. Listeria rarely exceeded the EU food safety limit tested in ready‐to‐eat food. In total, 5,175 food‐borne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella remained the most detected agent but the number of outbreaks due to S. Enteritidis decreased. Norovirus in fish and fishery products was the agent/food pair causing the highest number of strong‐evidence outbreaks. The report provides further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, West Nile virus, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia.",,EFSA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913300/,455

Women and children are disproportionately vulnerable to such crises, which are intensified under inequitable social conditions and driven by structural barriers to female equality. No research has yet looked at the complex relationship between climate crisis, structural gender inequality, human insecurity, and vulnerability to modern slavery. Our research examined the relationship between environmental stressors associated with climate change, selected structural inequalities, and the estimated prevalence of modern slavery cases across 180 countries. Regression analysis revealed significant results. These findings suggest that indicators of poor environmental health may exacerbate structural social inequalities and increase women’s risk of falling victim to modern slavery. Results showed that women’s share of seats in parliament, education for women, tree cover loss, agricultural management, and air quality assumed more substantial roles in this prediction. Awareness of the unique relationship between environmental indicators of climate change, gender inequality, and modern slavery provides a meaningful contribution to our understanding of factors driving human exploitation. Additionally, we propose a gender analysis of environmental stressors to address both the climate crisis and structural inequalities that increases female vulnerability to insecurity.","Cameron, Erinn C.; Hemingway, Samantha L.; Cunningham, Fiona J.; Jacquin, Kristine M.",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937546/,455

47073,Risk Premium and Comparison with Damodaran Methodology,2020-09-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer cachexia is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by the loss of muscle and fat and occurs in 50–80% of cancer patients. In cancer cachexia, the tumor tissues interact with other tissues and organs using secretory factors. Differentiated immune cells from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the bone marrow contribute to the systemic inflammation and may be affected by these intertissue interactions. However, the significant changes that occur in the bone marrow and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of cancer cachexia on bone and stem cells that reside in the bone marrow using a lung cancer cachexia animal model. Cancer cachexia induces bone loss and impairs the properties of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells via JAK/STAT and glucocorticoid signaling. Our findings provide new insights for developing a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer cachexia. ABSTRACT: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial systemic inflammation disease caused by complex interactions between the tumor and host tissues via soluble factors. However, whether cancer cachexia affects the bone marrow, in particular the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), remains unclear. Here, we investigated the bone marrow and bone in a cancer cachexia animal model generated by transplanting Lewis lung carcinoma cells. The number of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) started to significantly decrease in the cancer cachectic animal model prior to the discernable loss of muscle and fat. This decrease in BM-MNCs was associated with myeloid skewing in the circulation and the expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Bone loss occurred in the cancer cachexia animal model and accompanied the decrease in the bone marrow MSCs that play important roles in both supporting HSCs and maintaining bone homeostasis. Glucocorticoid signaling mediated the decrease in bone marrow MSCs in the cancer cachectic environment. The cancer cachexia environment also skewed the differentiation of the bone marrow MSCs toward adipogenic fate via JAK/STAT as well as glucocorticoid signaling. Our results suggest that the bone loss induced in cancer cachexia is associated with the depletion and the impaired differentiation capacity of the bone marrow MSCs.","Yu, Jinyeong; Choi, Sanghyuk; Park, Aran; Do, Jungbeom; Nam, Donghyun; Kim, Youngjae; Noh, Jinok; Lee, Kil Yeon; Maeng, Chi Hoon; Park, Ki-Sook",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7958949/,455

Hence, the present study is aimed at determining the standard values of the P-wave in children and adolescents based on ECG data from the CARDIOPED project, a large-scale general population of children who participated in a screening program in Transylvania, Romania. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 22,411 ECGs of participants aged 6 to 18 years old from a school-based ECG screening were obtained between February 2015 and December 2015 in Transylvania, Romania. Three pediatric cardiologists manually reviewed each ECG. P-wave duration, voltage, axis, and correlation with gender and age were analyzed. The mean P-wave duration was 88 ± 10.7 ms, with a maximum duration of 128 ms. P-wave showed a positive correlation with age but did not differ between sexes. There was a positive correlation between the P-wave duration and the heart rate, but not with the body max index. The mean P-wave axis was 40.4 ± 31.1, and the mean P-wave amplitude was 0.12 ± 0.03 mV. CONCLUSION: In this study on many pediatric subjects, we have provided normal limits for the P-wave in Romanian children aged 6-18 years. Our findings are useful for creating interpretation guidelines for pediatric ECG.","Cismaru, Gabriel; Lazea, Cecilia; Mureşan, Lucian; Gusetu, Gabriel; Rosu, Radu; Pop, Dana; Zdrenghea, Dumitru; Farcaş, Anca Daniela; Căinap, Simona Sorana",Dis Markers,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7959889/,455

Since the daily new deaths exhibit highly over-dispersion, we introduce a new two-parameter discrete distribution, called discrete generalized Lindley, which enables us to model all kinds of dispersion such as under-, equi-, and over-dispersion. Additionally, we introduce a new count regression model based on the proposed distribution to investigate the effects of the important risk factors on the counts of deaths for OECD countries. Three data sets are analyzed with proposed models and competitive models. Empirical findings show that air pollution, the proportion of obesity, and smokers in a population do not affect the counts of deaths for OECD countries. The interesting empirical result is that the countries with having higher alcohol consumption have lower counts of deaths.","El-Morshedy, M.; Altun, Emrah; Eliwa, M.

Contrary to the expectation that trade restrictions lead to the shrinking or disruption of GVCs, our article posits that the unintended consequences of trade policies (both restrictions and trade agreements) are amplified by the prevalence and organizational complexity of GVCs. We anchor our argument in the historical evolution of three classic GVCs – apparel, automobiles, and electronics – from the 1970s to the present. Our framework highlights the dynamic interaction between GVC-oriented trade policies and firm strategies, which often has counterintuitive implications in terms of upgrading outcomes for the countries and companies involved in these GVCs. While trade policies often provide momentum for an adaptive reconfiguration of GVCs, firms’ strategic actions are crucial in modifying the geographic and organizational features of GVCs in ways that support their longevity. Firm strategies can mediate the effect of trade policies on GVC configurations in two ways: (1) firms can accommodate trade restrictions and trade agreements by altering supply and demand locations and by switching supply-chain partners; and (2) firms pursue diverse strategies to upgrade their value chain activities, leveraging the shifting geographies associated with new trade rules.","Gereffi, Gary; Lim, Hyun-Chin; Lee, Joonkoo",J Int Bus Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961166/,455

Ellman’s assay is the standard spectrophotometric method to measure cholinesterase activity in clinical laboratories. The authors present a new colorimetric test to assess AChE and BChE activity in biological samples using chromogenic reagents, treated 3D-printed measuring pads and a smartphone camera as a signal detector. Multiwell pads treated with reagent substrates 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenyl acetate, indoxylacetate, ethoxyresorufin and methoxyresorufin were prepared and tested for AChE and BChE. In the experiments, 3D-printed pads containing indoxylacetate as a chromogenic substrate were optimal for analytical purposes. The best results were achieved using the red (R) channel, where the limit of detection was 4.05 µkat/mL for BChE and 4.38 µkat/mL for AChE using a 40 µL sample and a 60 min assay. The major advantage of this method is its overall simplicity, as samples are applied directly without any specific treatment or added reagents. The assay was also validated to the standard Ellman’s assay using human plasma samples. In conclusion, this smartphone camera-based colorimetric assay appears to have practical applicability and to be a suitable method for point-of-care testing because it does not require specific manipulation, additional education of staff or use of sophisticated analytical instruments.","Pohanka, Miroslav; Zakova, Jitka",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961819/,455
47097,Country Dependence on Commodity Resources and Exports,2020-09-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay is widely used in clinical practice due to its reimbursement by Japan’s universal health-care system for cancer patients who finished standard treatment in June 2019. To clarify the clinical utility of the NGS assay under the universal health-care system, we retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent NGS assay at our hospital. Since reimbursement of the NGS assay is restricted to patients who complete standard treatment, many patients experience clinical disease progression before receiving results; therefore, they could not use the NGS results for making a therapeutic decision. Broader reimbursement of NGS assays for advanced cancer patients is needed for making optimum use of the NGS assay results. Providing good access to clinical trials and off-label agents is necessary for enabling patients to benefit from NGS assay. Additionally, this study revealed that the disclosure of presumed germline findings is feasible in clinical practice. ABSTRACT: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay is part of routine care in Japan owing to its reimbursement by Japan’s universal health-care system; however, reimbursement is limited to patients who finished standard treatment. We retrospectively investigated 221 patients who underwent Foundation One CDX (F1CDx) at our hospital. Every F1CDx result was assessed at the molecular tumor board (MTB) for treatment recommendation. Based on patients’ preferences, presumed germline findings were also assessed at the MTB and disclosed at the clinic. In total, 204 patients underwent F1CDx and 195 patients completed the analysis; however, 13.8% of them could not receive the report due to disease progression. Among 168 patients who received the results, 41.6% had at least one actionable alteration, and 3.6% received genomically matched treatment. Presumed germline findings were nominated in 24 patients, and 16.7% of them contacted a geneticist counselor. The NGS assay should be performed earlier in the clinical course to maximize the clinical benefit. Broader reimbursement for the NGS assay would enhance the delivery of precision oncology to patients. Access to clinical trials affects the number of patients who benefit from NGS. Additionally, the disclosure of presumed germline findings is feasible in clinical practice.","Inagaki, Chiaki; Maeda, Daichi; Hatake, Kazue; Sato, Yuki; Hashimoto, Kae; Sakai, Daisuke; Yachida, Shinichi; Nonomura, Iwao; Satoh, Taroh",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961835/,455

47117,The Concept of Shared Value in Ensuring Territories Inclusive Development,2020-09-12,"The present study describes an outbreak of Classical swine fever (CSF) in an organized pig farm followed by an episode of CSF virus (CSFV) associated congenital tremors in piglets. The outbreak was recorded in a newly procured herd of Hampshire pigs housed adjacent to the existing pigs of the farm. The recorded CSF outbreak caused a mortality of 100% in the newly procured and 54.28% in the existing herd. As the disease subsides, the clinically recovered boars were served naturally with Tamworth gilts. Though, the sows farrowed on usual gestation period, litters born to each sow showed congenital tremors and eventually died within 24 h of birth. Necropsy analysis of affected piglets was indicative of CSFV infection and was further confirmed using RT-PCR signifying a transplacental infection. The CSFV strains from the initial outbreak and post outbreak episode of congenital tremors were successfully isolated in PK-15 cells and detected in indirect FAT and RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on E2 gene and 5′NTR of CSFV grouped the isolates within the genotype 2.2 and revealed close resemblance with previously reported Indian isolates of CSFV genotype 2.2 origin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CSFV induced congenital form reported from India under natural conditions.","Barman, Nagendra Nath; Khatoon, Elina; Bora, Mousumi; Deori, Lalit; Gogoi, Sophia M.; Kalita, Dhireswar",Virusdisease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7965332/,455

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), especially bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, have adverse effects on human health. However, the association of BPA and phthalates with breast cancer remains conflicting. This study aims to investigate the association of BPA and phthalates with breast cancer. Methods: Correlative studies were identified by systematically searching three electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Embase, up to November 2020. All data were analyzed using Stata 15.0. Results: A total of nine studies, consisting of 7820 breast cancer cases and controls, were included. The urinary phthalate metabolite mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono-2-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were negatively associated with breast cancer (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60–0.90; OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58–0.98, respectively). However, the overall ORs for BPA, mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), and mono-butyl phthalate (MBP) were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.69–1.05), 0.96 (95% CI: 0.62–1.48), 1.12 (95% CI: 0.88–1.42), 1.13 (95% CI: 0.74–1.73), 1.01 (95% CI: 0.74–1.40), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.48–1.14), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.15), respectively, suggesting no significant association. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were relatively stable. Conclusion: Phthalate metabolites MBzP and MiBP were passively associated with breast cancer, whereas no associations were found between BPA, MEP, MEHHP, MEHP, MEOHP, MCPP, and MBP and breast cancer.

In this paper, we aim to cover scene perception and visual localization needed by navigation assistance in a unified way. We present a semantic visual localization system to help visually impaired people to be aware of their locations and surroundings in indoor environments. Our method relies on 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation of RGB-D images captured from a pair of wearable smart glasses. We can inform the user of an upcoming object via audio feedback so that the user can be prepared to avoid obstacles or interact with the object, which means that visually impaired people can be more active in an unfamiliar environment.","Chen, Haoye; Zhang, Yingzhi; Yang, Kailun; Martinez, Manuel; Müller, Karin; Stiefelhagen, Rainer",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972587/,455
48664,Wir können über uns nachdenken – der Computer nicht,2020-10-27,"With the development of industry and the spread of the Smart Home, the need for power monitoring solution technologies for effective energy management systems is increasing. Of these, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), is an efficient way to solve the electricity consumption monitoring problem. NILM is a technique to measure the power consumption of individual devices by analyzing the power data collected through smart meters and commercial devices. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based NILM technique that enables energy disaggregation and power consumption monitoring simultaneously. Energy disaggregation is performed by learning a deep residual network for performing multilabel regression. Real-time monitoring is performed using a multivariate control chart technique using latent variables extracted through weights of the trained model. The energy disaggregation and monitoring performance of the proposed method is verified using the public NILM Electricity Consumption and Occupancy (ECO) data set.","Oh, Cheolhwan; Jeong, Jongpil",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978548/,455

Uncertainties remain regarding incident thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. We carried out a prospective study to characterize the evolution of thyroid function and autoimmunity among COVID-19 survivors. Method: Consecutive adult patients, without known thyroid disorders, admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for confirmed COVID-19 from 21 July to 21 September 2020 were included. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and anti-thyroid antibodies were measured on admission and at 3 months. Positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) was defined by >100 units. Results: Among 200 COVID-19 survivors, 122 had reassessment thyroid function tests (TFTs) (median age: 57.5 years; 49.2% men). Baseline characteristics of patients who did and did not have reassessment were comparable. Among the 20 patients with baseline abnormal TFTs on admission, mostly low fT3, 15 recovered. Of the 102 patients with normal TFTs on admission, two (2.0%) had new onset abnormal TFTs, which may represent TFTs in different phases of thyroiditis (one had mildly elevated TSH 5.8 mIU/L, with normal fT4 [16 pmol/L] and fT3 [4.3 pmol/L], the other had mildly raised fT4 25 pmol/L with normal TSH [1.1 mIU/L] and fT3 [4.7 pmol/L]). Among 104 patients with anti-thyroid antibody titers reassessed, we observed increases in anti-TPO (baseline: 28.3 units [IQR 14.0-67.4] vs reassessment: 35.0 units [IQR: 18.8-99.0]; p<0.001) and anti-Tg titers (baseline: 6.6 units [IQR 4.9-15.6] vs reassessment: 8.7 units [IQR: 6.6-15.4]; p<0.001), but no change in anti-TSHR titer (baseline: 1.0 IU/L [IQR: 0.8-1.2] vs reassessment: 1.0 IU/L [IQR: 0.8-1.3]; p=0.486). Of the 82 patients with negative anti-TPO at baseline, 16 had significant interval increase in anti-TPO titer by >12 units (2×6 [precision of the anti-TPO assay in normal range being 6 units per SD]), of these, four became anti-TPO positive. Factors associated a significant increase in anti-TPO titer included worse baseline clinical severity (p=0.018), elevated C-reactive protein during hospitalization (p=0.033), and higher baseline anti-TPO titer (p=0.005). Conclusion: Majority of thyroid dysfunction on admission recovered during convalescence. Abnormal TFTs suggestive of thyroiditis could occur during convalescence, though uncommon. Importantly, we provided the novel observation of an increase in anti-thyroid antibody titers post-COVID-19, suggesting the potential of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering thyroid autoimmunity, which warrants further follow-up for incident thyroid dysfunction among COVID-19 survivors.","Lui, David T W; Lee, Chi Ho; Chow, Wing Sun; Lee, Alan C H; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Fong, Carol H Y; Law, Chun Yiu; Leung, Eunice K H; To, Kelvin K W; Tan, Kathryn C B; Woo, Yu Cho; Lam, Ching Wan; Hung, Ivan F N; Lam, Karen S L",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089826/,455

Consequently, COVID-19 pandemic has caused uncertainty about the possible increased risk of suffering SARS-CoV-2 infection that could confer IBD or its treatments. The aim of this study is to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in patients with IBD as well as the existence of potential risk factors for its development. METHODS: This is a unicentric cross-sectional study developed in IBD unit of University Hospital “Lozano Blesa” of Zaragoza. Patients older than 18 years with established diagnosis of Crohn′s Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Indeterminate Colitis (IC) have been included. A blood sample has been drawn from each patient to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (ELISA method) and each patient has completed a questionnaire to know symptoms related to infection and previous comorbidity. We have performed a descriptive analysis and a univariate analysis to study relationship between potential risk factors and seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: 431 patients have been included, with a mean age of 50.2 ± 14.1 years and a 51.3% of women. Of them, 49.7% suffer from UC, 49.2% CD and 1.2% IC. Related to the treatment, 23.5% receive anti-TNF biologic agents, 13.1% other kind of biologic agents, 9.3% immunomodulators, 7.7% combined treatment (biologic agent and immunomodulator), 33.1% other treatment and 13.3% no treatment. According to World Health Organization (WHO) definitions, 85.6% had not suffered the infection, 7.7% were confirmed cases (only 3 admitted patients) and 6.7% were probable cases. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 obtained is 8.8%, being significantly higher among confirmed cases than among probable cases (71.0% in confirmed vs 6.9% in probable; RR 10.3; p<0.001). A higher risk of seroconversion has been detected among patients without biologic agents (11.8% in patients without biologic agents vs 5.3% in patients with biologic agents; RR 2.2; p=0.021). No differences have been observed in the seroprevalence of patients with other treatments for IBD or in terms of age, active smoking, level of inflammation markers, the presence of symptoms of infection or hospital admission. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 of Aragon′s patients with IBD is similar to that described in national seroprevalence study of Ministry of Health for the region (8.8%).

However, working mostly reactive and not being anchored in the corresponding organizational levels, such instruments are limited in terms of effectiveness. ARGUMENTS: Based on these shortcomings of clinical ethics consultation the multiprofessional working group “Ethics” at the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany has endeavored to design and implement new structures for sustainable ethical decision-making processes on its hospital wards. The Tübingen Model “Ethics Consultants on the Ward” is a pilot project intended to appoint specifically trained nursing staff on all wards as contact partners for ethical issues. Thus, the Tübingen Model represents an extension to established structures of clinical ethics consultation and complements existing top-down strategies. CONCLUSIONS: This article presents the objectives of the Tübingen Model and describes initial experiences in its implementation. After explaining their role within the existing structures of ethics consultation at the hospital, the tasks of the ethics consultants within and across the hospital’s wards are presented.

V.",2021-09-14,"INTRODUCTION: Preterm infants are at increased risk of exposure to histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA) when compared to term-born controls, and this is associated with several neonatal morbidities involving brain, lungs and gut. Preterm infants could benefit from immunomodulatory therapies in the perinatal period, but development of rational treatment strategies requires improved characterization of the perinatal response to HCA. We had two objectives: The first, to characterize the umbilical cord blood immune profile in preterm infants compared to term-born controls; the second, to investigate the postnatal immune response in preterm infants exposed to HCA versus those who were not. POPULATION: For objective one 59 term infants [mean gestational age (GA) 39(+4) (37(+3) to 42(+0))] and 55 preterm infants [mean GA29(+0)(23(+3) to 32(+0))] with umbilical cord samples available were included; for objective two we studied 96 preterm infants [mean GA29(+1)(23(+2) to 32(+0))] for whom placental histology and postnatal blood samples were available. METHODS: Placental histopathology was used to identify reaction patterns indicative of HCA, and a customized immunoassay of 24 inflammatory markers and trophic proteins selected to reflect the perinatal immune response was performed on umbilical cord blood in term and preterm participants and postnatal day 5 blood in the preterm group. RESULTS: The umbilical cord blood immune profile classified gestational age category with 86% accuracy (95% CI 0.78-0.92), p-value=1.242x10(-14). Pro-inflammatory proteins IL-6, MCP-1 and CRP were elevated in the cord blood of preterm infants whilst BDNF, C3, C9, IL-18, MMP-9 and RANTES were decreased, compared to infants born at term. In preterm infants, exposure to HCA was associated with elevations in 8 immune proteins on postnatal day 5 (BDNF, C3, C5a, C9, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1β and MMP-9) when compared to preterm infants who were not exposed. CONCLUSION: Preterm birth is associated with a distinct immune profile in umbilical cord blood and preterm infants exposed to HCA with evidence of a fetal inflammatory response have specific alterations in immune function that are apparent on day 5 of postnatal life.","Sullivan, Gemma; Galdi, Paola; Borbye-Lorenzen, Nis; Stoye, David Q.; Lamb, Gillian J.; Evans, Margaret J.; Skogstrand, Kristin; Chandran, Siddharthan; Boardman, James P.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8430209/,455

RSV disease manifestations in children range from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. In South Africa, the seasonality of RSV disease causing both upper and lower respiratory tract illness is well documented. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of RSV bronchiolitis among patients ≤24 months of age who presented to a tertiary institution with a diagnosed viral bronchiolitis over a 4-year period. Secondary aims included determining: (i) the risk factors for the development of RSV bronchiolitis; (ii) the fatality rates and risk factors associated with mortality; (iii) the correlation with c-reactive protein values and risk of comorbid bacterial infection; and (iv) the impact of seasonality on RSV incidence. METHODS: A retrospective chart-based analysis of laboratory-confirmed RSV cases in children ≤24 months, presenting to Steve Biko Academic Hospital from January 2013 to December 2016, was undertaken. Epidemiology, risk factors and local weather data were collected as part of the analysis. RESULTS: During the 4-year period, a total of 1 127 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) was collected. RSV was isolated from 162 NPAs by either immunofluorescence (84%) or polymerase chain reaction (16%). Of the 162 patients with RSV bronchiolitis, 131 (80.9%) had a known HIV status. Only 2 (1.5%) of the patients whose status was known were HIV-infected; 26 (19.8%) were HIV-exposed and confirmed negative; and 103 (78.6%) HIV-unexposed. Forty-nine patients (30.2%) with RSV required intensive care unit (ICU, either paediatric or neonatal) admission. Thirty-four (69.4%) of these were <6 months old. Prematurity (27.8%) and cardiac lesions (13%) were the most common risk factors for acquiring the disease identified in patients with RSV bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION: RSV is still a commonly detected virus among infants who are admitted for bronchiolitis. Significant risk factors associated with admission due to RSV bronchiolitis were prematurity, being <6 months of age and congenital cardiac disease. Male gender and HIV status did not appear to increase the risk of RSV bronchiolitis. In fact, HIV seems to have a protective effect against specifically RSV bronchiolitis in children <2 years of age. Young babies, especially premature infants with RSV bronchiolitis, are at considerable risk of requiring ICU admission, which leads to a significant increase in admission costs.","Dearden, C X; Jeevarathnum, A C; Havinga, J; Green, R J",Afr J Thorac Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8432915/,455

A number of studies have investigated the cause underlying the occurrence of heavy haze pollution around the world during the lockdown period. However, information about spatiotemporal variations in gaseous pollutants and detailed quantifications of potential meteorological (METRO) impacts are limited. Ground measurements show that carbon monoxide (CO) pollution deteriorated in northern China despite strict control of human and industrial activities during the lockdown period in early 2020. In this study, a four-dimensional decomposition model was used to quantitatively extract the METRO impacts on the CO pollution over China. The results show that weakened winds elevated CO concentrations near Beijing and in northeastern China. Increased temperatures slightly elevated CO concentrations in northern and eastern China but reduced CO concentrations in northwestern China. Remarkable amounts of CO increases in northern China (e.g., by 0.21 mg/m(3) within Beijing) were explained by anomalously high humidity, which could be associated with an enhanced interaction between aerosol and the boundary layer. After excluding the METRO impacts, the CO concentrations drastically declined across China (e.g., by 0.22 mg/m(3) within Beijing), indicating that the lockdown indeed greatly lessened CO concentrations. However, the adverse METRO conditions counteracted the beneficial outcomes of emission reductions, leading to a deterioration of the CO pollution in northern China. These results indicate that the METRO factors can play a critical role in worsening air pollution despite a strict control of anthropogenic emissions.","Lin, Jianhua; Lin, Changqing; Tao, Minghui; Ma, Jun; Fan, Liqin; Xu, Ren-An; Fang, Chunyu",ACS Earth Space Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457327/,455

The COVISHIELD (ChAdOx-nCoV-19) vaccine developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford University is approved by the Government of India to be administered in a phased manner. We present the case of twin subjects who suffered various adverse effects after receiving the COVISHIELD vaccine; one of the twins presented with palatal petechiae lesions presumably caused by the vaccine. The lesions were self-limiting and required no treatment. CONCLUSION: Oral lesions reported first time in our case should be correlated with similar lesions found post-COVID vaccines globally. There is a further need to ascertain a high level of scientific evidence and explore the biological plausibility underlying oral complications and COVID vaccinations.","Sayare, Bhawna; Bhardwaj, Vinay Kumar; Sharma, Deepak",Egypt J Otolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475834/,455

60046,"Deforestation hotspots, climate crisis, and the perfect scenario for the next epidemic: The Amazon time bomb.",2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND There is wide variation in the reported size of ruptured intracranial aneurysms and methods of size estimation. There is widespread belief that small aneurysms < 7 mm do not rupture. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the size of ruptured aneurysms according to aneurysm locations and methods of size estimation. METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We included articles that reported mean aneurysm size in consecutive series of ruptured intracranial. We excluded studies limited to a specific aneurysm location or type. The random-effects model was used to calculate overall mean size and location-specific mean size. We performed meta-regression to explain observed heterogeneity and variation in reported size. RESULTS The systematic review included 36 studies and 12,609 ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Overall mean aneurysm size was 7.0 mm (95% confidence interval [CI 6.2-7.4]). Pooled mean size varied with location. Overall mean size of 2145 ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms was 6.0 mm (95% CI 5.6-6.4, residual I2 = 86%). Overall mean size of 743 ruptured posterior circulation aneurysms was 6.2 mm (95% CI 5.3-7.0, residual I2 = 93%). Meta-regression identified aneurysm location and definition of size (i.e., maximum dimension vs. aneurysm height) as significant determinants of aneurysm size reported in the studies. CONCLUSIONS The mean size of ruptured aneurysms in most studies was approximately 7 mm. The general wisdom that aneurysms of this size do not rupture is incorrect. Location and size definition were significant determinants of aneurysm size.","Waqas, Muhammad; Chin, Felix; Rajabzadeh-Oghaz, Hamidreza; Gong, Andrew D; Rai, Hamid H; Mokin, Maxim; Vakharia, Kunal; Dossani, Rimal H; Meng, Hui; Snyder, Kenneth V; Davies, Jason M; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04291-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215742/,455

60789,"Extreme winter cold-induced osmoregulatory, metabolic, and physiological responses in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) acclimatized at different salinities.",2021-06-01,"INTRODUCTION TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a Ser/Thr kinase with a central role in coordinating the cellular response to invading pathogens and regulating key inflammatory signaling cascades. While intact TBK1 signaling is required for successful anti-viral signaling, dysregulated TBK1 signaling has been linked to a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, including cancer. Several lines of evidence support a role for TBK1 in cancer pathogenesis, but the specific roles and regulation of TBK1 remain incompletely understood. A key challenge is the diversity of cellular processes that are regulated by TBK1, including inflammation, cell cycle, autophagy, energy homeostasis, and cell death. Nevertheless, evidence from pre-clinical cancer models suggest that targeting TBK1 may be an effective strategy for anti-cancer therapy in specific settings. AREAS COVERED This review provides an overview of the roles and regulation of TBK1 with a focus on cancer pathogenesis and drug targeting of TBK1 as an anti-cancer strategy. Relevant literature was derived from a PubMed search encompassing studies from 1999 to 2020. EXPERT OPINION TBK1 is emerging as a potential target for anti-cancer therapy. Inhibition of TBK1 alone may be insufficient to restrain the growth of most cancers, hence combination strategies will likely be necessary. Improved understanding of tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic TBK1 signaling will inform novel therapeutic strategies.","Revach, Or-Yam; Liu, Shuming; Jenkins, Russell W",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2020.1826929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962465/,455

Food insecurity will grow increasingly common in the economic wake of the coronavirus pandemic and prenatal care represents an early, clinical opportunity to identify families at risk. However, longitudinal relationships between clinically-identified prenatal food insecurity and prematurity, pediatric health care utilization, and postnatal social needs have not been described. METHODS We examined longitudinal data from mother-child dyads who received prenatal and pediatric care and social needs screening at a large academically-affiliated safety net medical center between October 2018 and July 2019. Associations among household food insecurity and premature birth, pediatric inpatient and outpatient utilization, missed immunizations, and postnatal social needs were estimated using adjusted regression. RESULTS Among the 268 mothers, those who experienced prenatal household food insecurity had 3 times higher odds of having a child born prematurely (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-8.9, p=0.05) and had children with higher inpatient hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.0-5.6, p=0.04) and missed immunizations (IRR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.3, p=0.03) in the first 6 months of the child's life. These mothers also had higher odds of having any social needs in the pediatric setting (odds ratio 3.4; 95% CI 1.5-8.0, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Prenatal household food insecurity was linked to future adverse perinatal and pediatric outcomes in low-income mother-child dyads.

Accomplishing this goal requires a reconceptualization of triage as a population-based systemic process that integrates care at all points of interaction between patients and the health care system. This system identifies at minimum 4 orders of contact: first order, the community; second order, prehospital; third order, facility; and fourth order, regional level. Adopting this approach will ensure that disaster response activities will occur in a comprehensive fashion that minimizes the patient care burden at each subsequent order of intervention and reduces the overall need to ration care. The seamless integration of all orders of intervention within this systems-based model of disaster-specific triage, coordinated through health emergency operations centers, can ensure that disaster response measures are undertaken in a manner that is effective, just, and equitable.","Bostick, Nathan A; Subbarao, Italo; Burkle, Frederick M; Hsu, Edbert B; Armstrong, John H; James, James J",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1097/dmp.0b013e3181825a2b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18769264/,455

However, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable groups in unstable housing are more susceptible to disease. This study aims to systematically examine the housing and health problems of vulnerable groups using a bibliometric approach to explore how housing causes health problems, types of health illnesses, and coping strategies. It is found that the poor housing mechanism, persistent inequalities, and poor housing environments have a significant impact on the health of vulnerable groups. Therefore, the government must make concerted efforts across all sectors to ensure that the housing and health care needs of vulnerable groups are improved, and that housing security standards and related policies are improved; targeted safety plans are formulated with community as the carrier, taking into account the characteristics of vulnerable groups; and new information technology is widely used to provide medical convenience for vulnerable groups. It is hoped that the research in this paper can arouse social attention to the health of vulnerable groups and improve their health from the perspective of housing, so as to point out the direction for solving the housing health problems of vulnerable groups in the future.","Chen, Junhua; Hao, Shuya; Wu, Ying",Reviews on environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2020-0167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049423/,455

Reduction in morbidity and mortality by the use of intervention strategies could result in thousands of lives being saved and savings of up to £400m per annum in the UK. This has resulted in the drive towards goal-directed therapy and intraoperative flow optimization of high-risk surgical patients being advocated by authorities such as the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.Conventional intraoperative monitoring gives little insight into the profound physiological changes occurring as a result of anesthesia and surgery. The build-up of an oxygen debt is associated with a poor outcome and strategies have been developed in the postoperative period to improve outcomes by repayment of this debt. New monitoring technologies such as minimally invasive cardiac output, depth of anesthesia and cerebral oximetry can minimize oxygen debt build-up. This has the potential to reduce complications and lessen the need for postoperative optimization in high-dependency areas.Flow monitoring has thus emerged as essential during intraoperative monitoring in high-risk surgery. However, evidence suggests that current optimization strategies of deliberately increasing flow to meet predefined targets may not reduce mortality.Could the addition of depth of anesthesia and cerebral and tissue oximetry monitoring produce a further improvement in outcomes?Retrospective studies indicate a combination of excessive depth of anesthesia hypotension and low anesthesia requirement results in increased mortality and length of hospital stay.Near infrared technology allows assessment and maintenance of cerebral and tissue oxygenation, a strategy, which has been associated with improved outcomes. The suggestion that the brain is an index organ for tissue oxygenation, especially in the elderly, indicates a role for this technology in the intraoperative period to assess the adequacy of oxygen delivery and reduce the build-up of an oxygen debt.The aim of this article is to make the case for depth of anesthesia and cerebral oximetry alongside flow monitoring as a strategy for reducing oxygen debt during high-risk surgery and further improve outcomes in high-risk surgical patients.","Bidd, Heena; Tan, Audrey; Green, David",Perioperative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-0525-2-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472198/,455

We suggest a way to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., aromatic compounds) from the mask with high amounts through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). To this end, the effects of zeolite catalyst properties on the upgradation efficiency of pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of wasted mask were investigated. The compositions and yields of pyrolytic gases and oils were characterized as functions of pyrolysis temperature and the type of zeolite catalyst (HBeta, HY, and HZSM-5), including the mesoporous catalyst of Al-MCM-41. The mask was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor, and the pyrolysis gases evolved in the reactor was routed to a secondary reactor inside which the zeolite catalyst was loaded. It was chosen 550 °C as the CFP temperature to compare the catalyst performance for the production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) because this temperature gave the highest oil yield (80.7 wt%) during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. The large pore zeolite group of HBeta and HY led to 134% and 67% higher BTEX concentrations than HZSM-5, respectively, likely because they had larger pores, higher surface areas, and higher acid site density than the HZSM-5. This is the first report of the effect of zeolite characteristics on BTEX production via CFP.","Lee, Seul Bee; Lee, Jechan; Tsang, Yiu Fai; Kim, Young-Min; Jae, Jungho; Jung, Sang-Chul; Park, Young-Kwon",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852997/,455

There are several factors that, potentially, can contribute to the differentiated impact of COVID-19, and explain the disparities seen among areas. This study aims to contribute to this debate by analysing the role of health system and social trust in lessening the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in French départements. METHODS The data used in this study have been provided by the INSEE and the French Ministry of Health. Database is made up of the 96 départements of metropolitan France. We use spatial analysis techniques to identify the groups of areas that are particularly affected, and to test the influence of local socioeconomic factors on the spread of the epidemic. RESULTS Our exploratory spatial analysis reveals the heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation of the disease. The use of spatial econometric models, then, allows us to highlight the impact of emergency services, and social capital in reducing the exposition to Covid-19. Our results also report on the role of spillover effects between neighbouring areas. CONCLUSIONS This research shows that, although individual characteristics are important factors in explaining the probability of contracting Covid-19 desease, health care services and social trust factors also play a significant role in curbing the epidemic's outbreak.

METHODS Between December 2011 and December 2015, 12 patients with type I aortic dissection concomitant involving supra-aortic vessels underwent ascending aortic replacement and simultaneous stent grafts inserted into the descending aorta, left subclavian, and left carotid arteries, and into the innominate artery when possible, without arch replacement. The stent grafts, Gore TAG thoracic endoprosthesis and Viabahn, were deployed under visual guidance through opened aortic arch into the true lumen, with the techniques of circulatory arrest, moderate hypothermia, and bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion. RESULTS Operation was performed smoothly in all patients. There was one death, and the other 11 recovered without any neurological deficits. Follow-up computed tomography scans showed that the true lumen expanded and false lumen regressed in both arch and descending aortic segments in 1 year. The diameter did not increase in either arch or descending aortic segments. CONCLUSION Ascending aortic replacement and stent graft for supra-aortic arteries and the descending aorta without arch replacement are feasible options for type I aortic dissection with satisfactory short-term aortic remodeling.","Hsu, Chiao-Po; Huang, Chun-Yang; Chen, Hsiang-Ting",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913117/,455

METHODS The study population included patients who underwent head and neck surgery at an academic tertiary care center between February 2020 and November 2020 and were discharged with one to four drains with instructions for home removal. Prior to discharge, patients received thorough drain removal education. Patients were prospectively followed to evaluate for associated outcomes. RESULTS One hundred patients were evaluated in the study. There was record for ninety-seven patients receiving education at discharge. The most common methods of education were face-to-face education and written instructions with educational video link provided. Of 123 drains upon discharge, 110 drains (89.4%) were removed at home while 13 (10.6%) were removed in office. Most drains were located in the neck (86.4%). There was one seroma, two hematomas, two drain site infections, and five ED visits; however, none of these complications were directly associated with the action of drain removal at home. Calculated cost savings for travel and lost wages was $259.82 per round trip saved. CONCLUSIONS The results demonstrate that home drain removal can provide a safe and efficacious option for patients following head and neck surgery. This approach was safe and associated with patient cost savings and better utilization of provider's time.

Prevalence of depression across different disabling conditions affecting adult patients, as well as risk factors for depression in these patient groups are reviewed in the current work, with a particular focus on the literature published in the past 5 years. The prevalence of depression in disabling conditions is higher than in the general population and is associated with different factors. Examples of disease-specific factors include neurological implications of stoke, diabetic related conditions (e.g. amputation), limitations imposed by vision loss caused by age-related eye diseases, fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis, and pain in cancer. Common factors identified across different conditions include pre-morbid depression, history of mental health problems, poor social support, disease-related disability, multi-morbidity, and less adaptive coping strategies. We also reviewed studies suggesting a potential bidirectional relationship between depression and chronic disease, particularly for stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and potential factors mediating that relationship. Current findings suggested that long-term depression might be associated with an increased risk of subsequent physical health problems, although the nature of that relationship and its underlying mechanisms are still unclear.","Senra, Hugo; McPherson, Susan",International review of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2021.1887823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823727/,455

The study material consisted of 13 neonatal calves with septicaemia (septicaemic calves, SC) and ten healthy neonatal calves (control calves, CC). Blood samples were collected for biochemical, haematological and microbiological analyses. In addition, faecal samples were collected for microbiological and virological analyses. Three of neonatal calves with septicaemia were positive for E. coli (E. coli O157 serotype) by microbiological examination, but all neonatal calves with septicaemia were negative for rota- and coronaviruses. By haematological examination, there were no significant differences between SC and CC for white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil (NEU) counts (P > 0.05). NEU counts were higher on day 0 than on day 15 in SC (P < 0.05). Red blood cell (RBC) counts and packed cell volume (PCV) values were higher on day 0 in the SC than in the CC (P < 0.05). By biochemical analyses, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), haptoglobin (Hp), and fibrinogen (Fb) concentrations were higher on day 0 in the SC than in the CC (P < 0.05). After treatment (on day 15), the serum IL-6, PCT, Hp, and Fb concentrations were significantly decreased in the SC compared to the CC (P < 0.05). The serum iron (Fe) concentrations were lower on day 0 in the SC than in the CC (P < 0.05), and were higher on day 15 than on day 0 in the SC (P < 0.05).

72754,Geochemical signatures of acidic drainage recorded in estuarine sediments after an extreme drought.,2020-08-03,"INTRODUCTION Advance planning of vaccine trials conducted during outbreaks increases our ability to rapidly define the efficacy and potential impact of a vaccine. Vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEI) is an important measure for understanding a vaccine's full impact, yet it is currently not identifiable in many trial designs because it requires knowledge of infectors' vaccination status. Recent advances in genomics have improved our ability to reconstruct transmission networks. We aim to assess if augmenting trials with pathogen sequence and contact tracing data can permit them to estimate VEI. METHODS We develop a transmission model with a vaccine trial in an outbreak setting, incorporate pathogen sequence data and contact tracing data, and assign probabilities to likely infectors. We then propose and evaluate the performance of an estimator of VEI. RESULTS We find that under perfect knowledge of infector-infectee pairs, we are able to accurately estimate VEI. Use of sequence data results in imperfect reconstruction of transmission networks, biasing estimates of VEI towards the null, with approaches using deep sequence data performing better than approaches using consensus sequence data. Inclusion of contact tracing data reduces the bias. CONCLUSION Pathogen genomics enhance identifiability of VEI, but imperfect transmission network reconstruction biases estimates towards the null and limits our ability to detect VEI.

When estimating the treatment effect, it is essential to appropriately adjust for selection bias due to observed confounders using, for example, propensity score weighting. Selection bias due to confounders occurs when individuals who are treated are substantially different from those who are untreated with respect to covariates that are also associated with the outcome. A comparison of the unadjusted, naive treatment effect estimate with the propensity score adjusted treatment effect estimate provides an estimate of the selection bias due to these observed confounders. In this article, we propose methods to identify the observed covariate that explains the largest proportion of the estimated selection bias. Identification of the most influential observed covariate or covariates is important in resource-sensitive settings where the number of covariates obtained from individuals needs to be minimized due to cost and/or patient burden and in settings where this covariate can provide actionable information to healthcare agencies, providers, and stakeholders. We propose straightforward parametric and nonparametric procedures to examine the role of observed covariates and quantify the proportion of the observed selection bias explained by each covariate. We demonstrate good finite sample performance of our proposed estimates using a simulation study and use our procedures to identify the most influential covariates that explain the observed selection bias in estimating the causal effect of alcohol use on progression of Huntington's disease, a rare neurological disease.","Parast, Layla; Griffin, Beth Ann",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388870/,455

78351,Automated logging of inspiratory and expiratory non-synchronized breathing (ALIEN) for mechanical ventilation.,2015,"Bayesian clinical trials allow taking advantage of relevant external information through the elicitation of prior distributions, which influence Bayesian posterior parameter estimates and test decisions. However, incorporation of historical information can have harmful consequences on the trial's frequentist (conditional) operating characteristics in case of inconsistency between prior information and the newly collected data. A compromise between meaningful incorporation of historical information and strict control of frequentist error rates is therefore often sought. Our aim is thus to review and investigate the rationale and consequences of different approaches to relaxing strict frequentist control of error rates from a Bayesian decision-theoretic viewpoint. In particular, we define an integrated risk which incorporates losses arising from testing, estimation, and sampling. A weighted combination of the integrated risk addends arising from testing and estimation allows moving smoothly between these two targets. Furthermore, we explore different possible elicitations of the test error costs, leading to test decisions based either on posterior probabilities, or solely on Bayes factors. Sensitivity analyses are performed following the convention which makes a distinction between the prior of the data-generating process, and the analysis prior adopted to fit the data. Simulation in the case of normal and binomial outcomes and an application to a one-arm proof-of-concept trial, exemplify how such analysis can be conducted to explore sensitivity of the integrated risk, the operating characteristics, and the optimal sample size, to prior-data conflict. Robust analysis prior specifications, which gradually discount potentially conflicting prior information, are also included for comparison. Guidance with respect to cost elicitation, particularly in the context of a Phase II proof-of-concept trial, is provided.","Calderazzo, Silvia; Wiesenfarth, Manuel; Kopp-Schneider, Annette",Biostatistics,https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735010/,455

An extensive body of work has linked these normal and aberrant cellular processes to mRNA transcription; however, the extent to which AR regulates posttranscriptional gene regulation remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that AR uses the translation machinery to shape the cellular proteome. We show that AR is a negative regulator of protein synthesis and identify an unexpected relationship between AR and the process of translation initiation in vivo. This is mediated through direct transcriptional control of the translation inhibitor 4EBP1. We demonstrate that lowering AR abundance increases the assembly of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, which drives enhanced tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we uncover a network of pro-proliferation mRNAs characterized by a guanine-rich cis-regulatory element that is particularly sensitive to eIF4F hyperactivity. Using both genetic and pharmacologic methods, we demonstrate that dissociation of the eIF4F complex reverses the proliferation program, resulting in decreased tumor growth and improved survival in preclinical models. Our findings reveal a druggable nexus that functionally links the processes of mRNA transcription and translation initiation in an emerging class of lethal AR-deficient prostate cancer.","Liu, Yuzhen; Horn, Jessie L; Banda, Kalyan; Goodman, Asha Z; Lim, Yiting; Jana, Sujata; Arora, Sonali; Germanos, Alexandre A; Wen, Lexiaochuan; Hardin, William R; Yang, Yu C; Coleman, Ilsa M; Tharakan, Robin G; Cai, Elise Y; Uo, Takuma; Pillai, Smitha P S; Corey, Eva; Morrissey, Colm; Chen, Yu; Carver, Brett S; Plymate, Stephen R; Beronja, Slobodan; Nelson, Peter S; Hsieh, Andrew C",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw4993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31366581/,455

81390,Differential and directional effects of perfusion on electrical and thermal conductivities in liver.,2009,"BACKGROUND Immunization is one of modern medicine's greatest achievements in the last three decades. Annually it can prevent nearly 2 to 3 million deaths. Understanding the determinants of effective immunization coverage is a critical undertaking. Accordingly, we set out to check the best available evidence of outstanding predictors of immunization coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Ethiopia. METHOD Electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, HINARI, and SCOPUS, Web of Science, African Journals Online, Ethiopian Medical Journals were searched. The search process, study selection, critical appraisal, and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers using Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-analysis for Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). The difference between reviewers was resolved with a third person. The risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Tool for observational studies. Data were extracted using the Microsoft Excel checklist and exported to STATA 13. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2, Funnel plot and Egger's test was used to check for publication bias. RESULTS We identified 26 studies with 15,042 children with mothers/caretakers to assess factors associated with immunization coverage and significant factors were: maternal formal education, (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.62-3.72), paternal formal education, (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.27-3.77), residence, (OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.00-4.45), birth at health facility (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 0.99-3.49), family size less than four, (OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.16-2.84), knowledge on age of immunization to be completed (OR = 6.18;95% CI: 3.07-12.43), knowledge on immunization schedule (OR = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.35-4.59), time to travel to health faculties, (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 0.62-4.89), antennal care, (OR = 3.11; 95% CI: 1.64-5.88), and tetanus toxoid vaccination, (OR = 4.82; 95% CI: 2.99-7.75). CONCLUSION Our findings showed that literacy, residence, awareness, family size, maternal health services use, and proximity of the health facilities were factors associated with full immunization. This implies that there is a need for primary health service expansion and health education to ""hard to reach areas"" to improve immunization coverage for children aged 12-23 months.","Nour, Tahir Yousuf; Farah, Alinoor Mohamed; Ali, Omer Moelin; Osman, Mohamed Omar; Aden, Mowlid Akil; Abate, Kalkidan Hassen",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09890-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243208/,455

82251,Bicomponent Conformal Electrode for Radiofrequency Sequential Ablation and Circumferential Separation of Large Tumors in Solid Organs: Development and In Vitro Evaluation.,2017,"BACKGROUND Measurement of partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) at high temporal resolution remains a technological challenge. This study introduces a novel PO2 sensing technology based on Multi-Frequency Phase Fluorimetry (MFPF). The aim was to validate MFPF against polarographic Clark-type electrode (CTE) PO2 measurements. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS MFPF technology was first investigated in N = 8 anaesthetised pigs at FIO2 of 0.21, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0. At each FIO2 level, blood samples were withdrawn and PO2 was measured in vitro with MFPF using two FOXY-AL300 probes immediately followed by CTE measurement. Secondly, MFPF-PO2 readings were compared to CTE in an artificial circulatory setup (human packed red blood cells, haematocrit of 30%). The impacts of temperature (20, 30, 40°C) and blood flow (0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, 4.0 L min(-1)) on MFPF-PO2 measurements were assessed. MFPF response time in the gas- and blood-phase was determined. Porcine MFPF-PO2 ranged from 63 to 749 mmHg; the corresponding CTE samples from 43 to 712 mmHg. Linear regression: CTE = 15.59+1.18*MFPF (R(2) = 0.93; P<0.0001). Bland Altman analysis: meandiff 69.2 mmHg, rangediff -50.1/215.6 mmHg, 1.96-SD limits -56.3/194.8 mmHg. In artificial circulatory setup, MFPF-PO2 ranged from 20 to 567 mmHg and CTE samples from 11 to 575 mmHg. Linear regression: CTE = -8.73+1.05*MFPF (R(2) = 0.99; P<0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis: meandiff 6.6 mmHg, rangediff -9.7/20.5 mmHg, 1.96-SD limits -12.7/25.8 mmHg. Differences between MFPF and CTE-PO2 due to variations of temperature were less than 6 mmHg (range 0-140 mmHg) and less than 35 mmHg (range 140-750 mmHg); differences due to variations in blood flow were less than 15 mmHg (all P-values>0.05). MFPF response-time (monoexponential) was 1.48±0.26 s for the gas-phase and 1.51±0.20 s for the blood-phase. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE MFPF-derived PO2 readings were reproducible and showed excellent correlation and good agreement with Clark-type electrode-based PO2 measurements. There was no relevant impact of temperature and blood flow upon MFPF-PO2 measurements. The response time of the MFPF FOXY-AL300 probe was adequate for real-time sensing in the blood phase.","Boehme, Stefan; Duenges, Bastian; Klein, Klaus U; Hartwich, Volker; Mayr, Beate; Consiglio, Jolanda; Baumgardner, James E; Markstaller, Klaus; Basciani, Reto; Vogt, Andreas",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0060591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23565259/,455

We used directed evolution in an organotypic human airway model to generate a highly infectious adeno-associated virus. This virus mediated gene transfer more than 100-fold better than parental strains and corrected the cystic fibrosis epithelial Cl(-) transport defect. Thus, under appropriate selective pressures, viruses can evolve to be more infectious than observed in nature, a finding that holds significant implications for designing vectors for gene therapy and for understanding emerging pathogens.","Excoffon, Katherine J D A; Koerber, James T; Dickey, David D; Murtha, Matthew; Keshavjee, Shaf; Kaspar, Brian K; Zabner, Joseph; Schaffer, David V",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0813365106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19237554/,455

In this review, we analyzed the mechanisms of inhibition of cysteine proteases on the basis of structural information and compiled kinetic data. The gathered structural data indicate that the protein fold is not a major obstacle for the evolution of a protease inhibitor. It appears that nature can convert almost any starting fold into an inhibitor of a protease. In addition, there appears to be no general rule governing the inhibitory mechanism. The structural data make it clear that the ""lock and key"" mechanism is a historical concept with limited validity. However, the analysis suggests that the shape of the active site cleft of proteases imposes some restraints. When the S1 binding site is shaped as a pocket buried in the structure of protease, inhibitors can apply substrate-like binding mechanisms. In contrast, when the S1 binding site is in part exposed to solvent, the substrate-like inhibition cannot be employed. It appears that all proteases, with the exception of papain-like proteases, belong to the first group of proteases. Finally, we show a number of examples and provide hints on how to engineer protein inhibitors.","Tušar, Livija; Usenik, Aleksandra; Turk, Boris; Turk, Dušan",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22030997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498210/,455

85490,National scale predictions of contemporary and future blue carbon storage.,2021-08-10,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are two of the most common viruses affecting domestic cats (Felis catus). During the last two decades, reports show that both viruses also infect or affect other species of the family Felidae. Human landscape perturbation is one of the main causes of emerging diseases in wild animals, facilitating contact and transmission of pathogens between domestic and wild animals. We investigated FIV and FeLV infection in free-ranging guignas (Leopardus guigna) and sympatric domestic cats in human perturbed landscapes on Chiloé Island, Chile. Samples from 78 domestic cats and 15 guignas were collected from 2008 to 2010 and analyzed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Two guignas and two domestic cats were positive for FIV; three guignas and 26 domestic cats were positive for FeLV. The high percentage of nucleotide identity of FIV and FeLV sequences from both species suggests possible interspecies transmission of viruses, facilitated by increased contact probability through human invasion into natural habitats, fragmentation of guigna habitat, and poultry attacks by guignas. This study enhances our knowledge on the transmission of pathogens from domestic to wild animals in the global scenario of human landscape perturbation and emerging diseases.","Mora, Mónica; Napolitano, Constanza; Ortega, René; Poulin, Elie; Pizarro-Lucero, José",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/2014-04-114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380363/,455

METHODS The experimental design involved randomized allocation of the surgical approach (4 open and 4 laparoscopic procedures) for eight adult pigs. A bipolar electrosurgery system (LigaSure) was used to perform 40 standardized regional dissections and procedures (5 per animal in randomized order). During these procedures, both white light and infrared thermographic imaging (3-5 mum) were recorded, and biopsy specimens were procured for histology. RESULTS The core body temperatures were significantly different between the two approaches. The laparoscopic group had a smaller temperature drop (3.08 +/- 0.98 degrees C vs 1.9 +/- 0.72 degrees C; p = 0.03). Differences also were observed in the thermal spread between the laparoscopic and open groups during portal vein dissection with the Advance (1.7 +/- 0.2 mm vs 2.3 +/- 1.7 mm; p = 0.07). Both thermography and histology confirmed the safety of the LigaSure system in limiting thermal spread and necrosis at the fusion line. Significant degradation of the instruments began after 10 activations. The deterioration was faster and more extensive in laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS Heat absorbance and thermal spread during bipolar electrosurgery are significantly different between open and laparoscopic surgery. Device performance degradation with repeat activations is more marked in laparoscopic surgery.","Song, C; Tang, B; Campbell, P A; Cuschieri, A",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0421-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19296174/,455

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for 1204 consecutive LDNs performed from March 2000 through August 2012. INTERVENTION LDN performed at an academic training center. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Using multivariable regression, we assessed the effect of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), laterality, and vascular variation on operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, and length of stay. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The following variables were associated with longer operative time (data given as parameter estimate plus or minus the standard error): female sex (9.09 ± 2.43; p<0.001), higher BMI (1.03 ± 0.32; p=0.001), two (7.87 ± 2.70; p=0.004) and three or more (22.45 ± 7.13; p=0.002) versus one renal artery, and early renal arterial branching (5.67 ± 2.82; p=0.045), while early renal arterial branching (7.81 ± 3.85; p=0.043) was associated with higher EBL. Overall, 8.2% of LDNs experienced complications, and by modified Clavien classification, 74 (5.9%) were grade 1, 13 (1.1%) were grade 2a, 10 (0.8%) were grade 2b, and 2 (0.2%) were grade 2c. There were no grade 3 or 4 complications. Three or more renal arteries (odds ratio [OR]: 2.74; 95% CI, 1.05-7.16; p=0.04) and late renal vein confluence (OR: 2.42; 95% CI, 1.50-3.91; p=0.0003) were associated with more complications. Finally, we did not find an association of the independent variables with length of stay. A limitation is that warm ischemia time was not assessed. CONCLUSIONS In our series, renal vascular variation prolonged operative time and was associated with more complications.

A brand new medical system-Hehe [see text] medicine, has been proposed based on a preventive-biomedical-psycho-social treatment model. This is characterized by a dual approach in which life nurturing is consistently practised and medical treatment is applied when necessary in order to maintain a healthy life. Its core value would facilitate the self-restoration to health and self-adaptation to nature through health cultivation and medical means. Medical services would be firstly provided to the prevention of potential disease germinating in the human body, and clinical medical treatment would be the last resort of systematic medical practice. This paper discusses not only this new concept but also the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine and biomedicine, especially how both medical systems compare in cognitive style, on a cultural level, and on a technical level.","Wang, Jie-Hua",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-011-0886-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22139547/,455

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to compare US in-hospital outcomes related to coiling with and without adjunctive stenting for unruptured aneurysms. METHODS Hospitalizations for coiling of unruptured cerebral aneurysms from 2004 to 2008 were identified in the NIS by extracting ICD-9-CM codes for the diagnosis of unruptured aneurysm (437.3) and intracranial stenting (00.65) with coiling (39.52, 39.79 or 39.72) of cerebral aneurysms. All patients with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (430) and/or intracerebral hemorrhage (431) were excluded. Mortality and discharge to a long-term facility were compared between stent and non-stent patient groups using multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS Patients treated with stent-assisted coiling had an in-hospital mortality rate of 0.08-0.8% compared with a death rate of 0.5% (95% CI 0.3% to 0.7%) for patients who did not receive a stent during coiling (p=0.36). Patients in the stent group had a 3% rate of discharge to a care facility (95% CI 1.5% to 5.8%) compared with 5% (95% CI 4.5% to 5.6%) for those in the non-stent group (p=0.14). Patients treated with a stent had a similar likelihood of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 2.12 (95% CI 0.32 to 7.11), p=0.34) and a lower likelihood of discharge to a long-term care facility (adjusted OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.16), p=0.16) compared with the non-stent group. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive stenting adds little in-hospital risk to the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. However, the need for dual antiplatelet therapy may predispose to delayed hemorrhagic complications and discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy may lead to delayed thromboembolic complications.","McDonald, Jennifer S; Norgan, Andrew P; McDonald, Robert J; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Kallmes, David F; Cloft, Harry J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22561915/,455

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, Cochrane Collaboration) were searched for all studies that described and evaluated treatment used for non-progressive dysarthria in adults. Studies were included if (1) participants were adults (18+ years) with a confirmed diagnosis of non-progressive dysarthria, (2) participants received intervention with pre-post outcome data, and (3) the article was published between 2006 and 2017 (including early online publications). Data extracted included the number of participants; etiology; dysarthria type and severity; age; gender; presence of a control group; intervention tasks, frequency and duration; outcome measures; and conclusions. Data extraction was completed by a member of the research team independently and crosschecked by another team member. RESULTS Of the 6728 articles identified, 21 met the inclusion criteria. The predominant study design was a case study or case series. The methodological quality of the studies varied. Typically, the interventions included impairment-based and activity level tasks targeting conversation. Approximately half of the interventions adhered to a treatment manual. CONCLUSIONS The evidence base to guide treatment for non-progressive dysarthria is increasing, with interventions showing promise in results, participant numbers, and positive participant feedback. Implications for rehabilitation The evidence base to guide treatment for non-progressive dysarthria is increasing, but remains limited. The majority of evidence is of moderate methodological quality.

99581,"Multiple stressor effects on alpha, beta and zeta diversity of riverine fish.",2020-08-08,"UNLABELLED A bat virus with high phylogenetic relatedness to human mumps virus (MuV) was identified recently at the nucleic acid level. We analyzed the functional activities of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion (F) proteins of the bat virus (batMuV) and compared them to the respective proteins of a human isolate. Transfected cells expressing the F and HN proteins of batMuV were recognized by antibodies directed against these proteins of human MuV, indicating that both viruses are serologically related. Fusion, hemadsorption, and neuraminidase activities were demonstrated for batMuV, and either bat-derived protein could substitute for its human MuV counterpart in inducing syncytium formation when coexpressed in different mammalian cell lines, including chiropteran cells. Cells expressing batMuV glycoproteins were shown to have lower neuraminidase activity. The syncytia were smaller, and they were present in lower numbers than those observed after coexpression of the corresponding glycoproteins of a clinical isolate of MuV (hMuV). The phenotypic differences in the neuraminidase and fusion activity between the glycoproteins of batMuV and hMuV are explained by differences in the expression level of the HN and F proteins of the two viruses. In the case of the F protein, analysis of chimeric proteins revealed that the signal peptide of the bat MuV fusion protein is responsible for the lower surface expression. These results indicate that the surface glycoproteins of batMuV are serologically and functionally related to those of hMuV, raising the possibility of bats as a reservoir for interspecies transmission. IMPORTANCE The recently described MuV-like bat virus is unique among other recently identified human-like bat-associated viruses because of its high sequence homology (approximately 90% in most genes) to its human counterpart. Although it is not known if humans can be infected by batMuV, the antigenic relatedness between the bat and human forms of the virus suggests that humans carrying neutralizing antibodies against MuV are protected from infection by batMuV. The close functional relationship between MuV and batMuV is demonstrated by cooperation of the respective HN and F proteins to induce syncytium formation in heterologous expression studies. An interesting feature of the glycoproteins of batMuV is the downregulation of the fusion activity by the signal peptide of F, which has not been reported for other paramyxoviruses. These results are important contributions for risk assessment and for a better understanding of the replication strategy of batMuV.","Krüger, Nadine; Hoffmann, Markus; Drexler, Jan Felix; Müller, Marcel Alexander; Corman, Victor Max; Sauder, Christian; Rubin, Steven; He, Biao; Örvell, Claes; Drosten, Christian; Herrler, Georg",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03693-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741010/,455

Background: The patient had several comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis. He developed ventilation-associated bacterial pneumonia for which he was administered cefepime at an initial dose of 2 g/8 h. Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed, showing overexposure with an initial trough concentration of > 60 mg/L. Methods: Analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data and model-based dose adjustment was performed using BestDose software. Results: The patient had unexpected PK parameter values. Serum creatinine was only moderately increased, whereas measured creatinine clearance based on urine collection showed impaired renal function. Bacterial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was also considered in the dosing decisions. After dose reduction to 0.5 g/8 h, the cefepime trough concentration progressively declined and reached the target values by the end of the therapy. A post-hoc analysis provided a different interpretation of drug overexposure. Conclusion: This case report illustrates how physiological, microbiological, and drug concentration data can be used for model-based dosage individualization of cefepime in ICU patients.","Goutelle, Sylvain; Jay, Lucille; Boidin, Clément; Cohen, Sabine; Bourguignon, Laurent; Bleyzac, Nathalie; Wallet, Florent; Vassal, Olivia; Friggeri, Arnaud",Therapeutic drug monitoring,https://doi.org/10.1097/ftd.0000000000000896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883521/,455

Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of extended care programs for obesity management delivered remotely in rural communities through the US Cooperative Extension System. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 21, 2013, to December 21, 2018, in Cooperative Extension Service offices of 14 counties in Florida. A total of 851 individuals were screened for participation; 220 individuals did not meet eligibility criteria, and 103 individuals declined to participate. Of 528 individuals who initiated a 4-month lifestyle intervention, 445 qualified for randomization. Data were analyzed from August 22 to October 21, 2019. Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to extended care delivered via individual or group telephone counseling or an education control program delivered via email. All participants received 18 modules with posttreatment recommendations for maintaining lost weight. In the telephone-based interventions, health coaches provided participants with 18 individual or group sessions focused on problem solving for obstacles to the maintenance of weight loss. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in body weight from the conclusion of initial intervention (month 4) to final follow-up (month 22). An additional outcome was the proportion of participants achieving at least 10% body weight reduction at follow-up. Results Among 445 participants (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [10.2] years; 368 [82.7%] women; 329 [73.9%] white), 149 participants (33.5%) were randomized to individual telephone counseling, 143 participants (32.1%) were randomized to group telephone counseling, and 153 participants (34.4%) were randomized to the email education control. Mean (SD) baseline weight was 99.9 (14.6) kg, and mean (SD) weight loss after the initial intervention was 8.3 (4.9) kg. Mean weight regains at follow-up were 2.3 (95% credible interval [CrI], 1.2-3.4) kg in the individual telephone counseling group, 2.8 (95% CrI, 1.4-4.2) kg for the group telephone counseling group, and 4.1 (95% CrI, 3.1-5.0) kg for the education control group, with a significantly smaller weight regain observed in the individual telephone counseling group vs control group (posterior probability >.99). A larger proportion of participants in the individual telephone counseling group achieved at least 10% weight reductions (31.5% [95% CrI, 24.1%-40.0%]) than in the control group (19.1% [95% CrI, 14.1%-24.9%]) (posterior probability >.99). Conclusions and Relevance This randomized clinical trial found that providing extended care for obesity management in rural communities via individual telephone counseling decreased weight regain and increased the proportion of participants who sustained clinically meaningful weight losses.

It is essential to determine how the bulk photophysical properties are correlated with their structures at both short and long ranges. Although CsSnCl3 is normally stable in the cubic perovskite structure only above 379 K, it was prepared as a metastable phase at room temperature. The transition from the cubic to the monoclinic phase, which is the stable form at room temperature, was tracked by solid-state 133Cs NMR spectroscopy and shown to take place through a first-order kinetics process. The complete solid solution CsSn(Cl1-x Br x )3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) was successfully prepared, exhibiting cubic perovskite structures extending between the metastable CsSnCl3 and stable CsSnBr3 end-members. The NMR spectra of CsSnBr3 samples obtained by three routes (high-temperature, mechanochemical, and solvent-assisted reactions) show distinct chemical shift ranges, spin-lattice relaxation parameters and peak widths, indicative of differences in local structure, defects and degree of crystallinity within these samples. Variable-temperature 119Sn spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal spontaneous mobility of Br atoms in CsSnBr3.

111580,An overview of methods of fine and ultrafine particle collection for physicochemical characterisation and toxicity assessments.,2020-11-06,"1. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,5 million people and caused the death of more than a hundred thousand people across the globe as of writing. Recently, Mao et al. [1] investigated the penetration potential of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system in 214 patients. They reported that 36.4% of the patients had some neurologic findings which are ranged from nonspecific manifestations, e.g., dizziness, headache, and seizure, to specific manifestations, e.g., loss of sense of smell or taste, and stroke. Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients. Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2]. Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates via human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) that was also utilized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3]. Glial cells and neurons have been reported to express ACE-2 receptors, which make them a potential target of COVID-19. It was indicated that SARS CoV causes neuronal death by invading the brain via olfactory epithelium [4]. The electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings have corroborated the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue [4] and cerebrospinal fluid [5]. Together, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by penetrating the brain via the cribriform plate, which can account for the early findings of the COVID-19 like altered sense of smell or hyposmia. Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6]. Therefore, in the countries that have taken action to the virus, clinic studies of AD have been stopped to protect the patients. However, rigorous quarantine of elders has aborted clinic trials and experimental studies conducted with transgenic animals. Transgenic models are quite expensive; the loss of these animals has costly consequences. There is no doubt that this storm will stop, but its catastrophic effects on dementia research will continue for a time. Thus, dementia researchers and pharmaceutical companies should determine an emergency action plan to exit the chaos of this pandemic. Here, we listed some challenges in dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak and table some suggestions. All countries try to control SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing. Therefore, neurology clinics were closed, and routine examination of Alzheimer's patients was stopped. However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research. Additionally, the arrest of experimental studies due to the closing of universities in two hundred countries also deprives experimental achievements. The closing of universities may lead to data loss, death of expensive transgenic animals, international researchers to be faced with visa problems, and be lost the laboratory staff whose contract has expired [7]. It is impossible that forecasting when this COVID-19 pandemic will end is impossible and thus, it is essential that a solution be developed to continue dementia studies on Alzheimer's patients. Remote monitoring of the patients with the use of technology is in the lead of possible solutions. Clinicians can continue to follow their patients by telemedicine [8], but extended lockdown of patients may cause depression in both patients and their caregivers [9]. It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10]. The monitorization of the patient in this condition with telemedicine would not provide objective data. In addition, when patients living in rural areas are considered, it will not be a surprise that reaching equally all patients is impossible. Therefore, a collective action plan protecting dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak should be prepared by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, and patients. Data loss is in the lead of expected problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the planned ending dates of phase 2/3 trials of gantenerumab (Roche) and solanezumab (Lilly) were missed [11]. It is highly essential that patients be monitored from their homes with telemedicine to protect them. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies. We suggest that patients of phase trails should be isolated in fully-equipped nursing homes managed by qualified personnel. In this way, the patients can be more effectively protected from SARS-CoV-2 and the depression caused by the lockdown.Young family members going out for basic needs could infect older family members. Also, patients with AD pay less attention to hand hygiene, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, cats have recently been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Patients with AD may not follow directions of neurologists on telemedicine and thus, the interaction of Alzheimer's patients with pets can cause a dangerous scenario. Consequently, the lockdown of patients with dementia in their homes might not be an appropriate exit strategy for the future of dementia research. On the other hand, it is important to mention here that the nursing home capacity of the United States may not be sufficient for 5,8 million Alzheimer's patients aged 65 years and older [13]. Thus, we highlight that only the patients involved in the clinic trails should be followed in the nursing homes. The other patients can be monitored with telemedicine from their homes. The data will hardly be lost in patients isolated in nursing homes. In this strategy, secondary risk factors affecting the clinic trails like depression are also removed. The motivations of clinicians and researchers is as important as the patients in the catastrophic atmosphere of the outbreak. Governments, media, and funders can support the motivations of clinicians and researchers. For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails. Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research. At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders. However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.","Bostanciklioglu, Mehmet; Temiz, Ebru",Current neurovascular research,https://doi.org/10.2174/1567202617666200522220509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442082/,455

Electrocardiography (ECG) can be utilized to obtain Low frequency (LF) to high frequency (HF) ratios that represent sympathetic to parasympathetic response, respectively and these ratios may be increased in people with chronic pain. Spinal manipulation is often used to manage musculoskeletal disorders such as neck pain. This study assesses the influence of cervical manipulation on HRV using LF/HF ratio. Ten subjects without neck pain formed the control condition and passive head movement (PHM) condition during which their head was flexed, extended and rotated. Ten subjects with subclinical neck pain underwent the same conditions. A separate session was performed for an actual manipulation. LabChart™ software was utilized to collect and analyze five minute pre and post R-R intervals. Repeated measures of ANOVA demonstrated significant interaction effect on HRV (F (1, 18) = 6.841, p = 0.018) following manipulation vs. PHM. Subsequent analysis showed a significant decrease in the ratio during manipulation condition (p = 0.0316), that was not seen in any other conditions, suggesting a significant autonomic nervous system alteration.

RESULTS Thirty obese [BMI=43 (40-49) kg m(-2)] and 29 lean [BMI=23 (21-25) kg m(-2)] patients completed the study. BIS was between 40 and 60 during 84 (69-91)% vs 85 (78-92)% of the anaesthetic time, P=0.46. The amount of propofol given during induction [1.2 (1.1-1.6) vs 1.3 (1.0-1.7) mg kg(-1), P=0.47] and maintenance [5.2 (4.1-6) vs 5.3 (4.7-6.4) mg kg(-1) h(-1), P=0.39] calculated using TBW was similar between the two groups. The dual-loop controller delivered half as much remifentanil to the obese patients during induction [1.0 (0.8-1.6) vs 2.2 (1.5-2.7) µg kg(-1), P<0.001] and maintenance [0.12 (0.07-0.16) vs 0.25 (0.17-0.29) µg kg(-1) min(-1), P<0.001] calculated using TBW. But when remifentanil consumption was calculated using IBW, the amounts were similar during induction at 2.2 (1.6-3.5) vs 2.0 (1.6-3.0) µg kg(-1) IBW, P=0.48, and during maintenance at 0.26 (0.16-0.34) vs 0.27 (0.18-0.33 ) µg kg(-1) min(-1), P=0.50. CONCLUSIONS The amount of propofol-remifentanil administered by the controller is consistent with current knowledge, propofol is best dosed using TBW whereas remifentanil is best dosed using IBW.

116391,Peripheral venous blood oxygen saturation can be non-invasively estimated using photoplethysmography.,2015,"Health disparities exist dependent on socioeconomic status, living conditions, race/ethnicity, diet, and exposures to environmental pollutants. Herein, the various exposures contributing to a person's exposome are collectively considered social determinants of health (SDOH), and the SDOH-exposome impacts health more than health care. This scoping review discusses the extent of evidence of the physiologic consequences of these exposures, often referred to as the exposome, at the intracellular level. We consider how the SDOH-exposome, which captures how individuals live, work and age, induces cell processes that modulate a conceptual ""redox rheostat."" Like an electrical resistor, the SDOH-exposome, along with genetic predisposition and age, regulate reductive and oxidative (redox) stress circuits and thereby stimulate inflammation. Regardless of the source of the SDOH-exposome that induces chronic inflammation and immunosenescence, the outcome influences cardiometabolic diseases, cancers, infections, sepsis, neurodegeneration and autoimmune diseases. The endogenous redox rheostat is connected with regulatory molecules such as NAD+/NADH and SIRT1 that drive redox pathways. In addition to these intracellular and mitochondrial processes, we discuss how the SDOH-exposome can influence the balance between metabolism and regulation of immune responsiveness involving the two main molecular drivers of inflammation, the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB induction. Mitochondrial and inflammasome activities play key roles in mediating defenses against pathogens and controlling inflammation before diverse cell death pathways are induced. Specifically, pyroptosis, cell death by inflammation, is intimately associated with common disease outcomes that are influenced by the SDOH-exposome. Redox influences on immunometabolism including protein cysteines and ion fluxes are discussed regarding health outcomes. In summary, this review presents a translational research perspective, with evidence from in vitro and in vivo models as well as clinical and epidemiological studies, to outline the intracellular consequences of the SDOH-exposome that drive health disparities in patients and populations. The relevance of this conceptual and theoretical model considering the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are highlighted. Finally, the case of asthma is presented as a chronic condition that is modified by adverse SDOH exposures and is manifested through the dysregulation of immune cell redox regulatory process we highlight in this review.","Emeny, Rebecca T; Carpenter, David O; Lawrence, David A",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2021.115444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549591/,455

METHODS This was an ecological study using secondary data retrieved on 8/19/2020. Cumulative incidence, mortality rate, case-fatality rate, and proportion of positive tests were calculated. The data were described and presented graphically, with their respective Spearman Correlation Coefficients. RESULTS The testing rate varied enormously between countries. Cumulative incidence and the proportion of positive tests were correlated with the number of tests, while the mortality rate and case-fatality rate showed low correlation with this indicator. CONCLUSION Most countries do not test enough to ensure adequate monitoring of the pandemic, and this is reflected in the quality of the indicators. Expanding the number of tests is essential, but it needs to be accompanied by other measures, such as isolation of diagnosed cases and contact tracing.","Pilecco, Flávia Bulegon; Coelho, Carolina Gomes; Fernandes, Qeren Hapuk Rodrigues Ferreira; Silveira, Ismael Henrique; Pescarini, Júlia Moreira; Ortelan, Naiá; Gabrielli, Ligia; Aquino, Estela M L; Barreto, Maurício Lima",Epidemiologia e servicos de saude : revista do Sistema Unico de Saude do Brasil,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1679-49742021000200002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008747/,455
118079,Corona pandemic: Teachings for dermatological teaching.,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND Esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an effective minimally invasive therapy for early esophageal cancer and high-grade Barrett dysplasia. However, esophageal stricture formation after circumferential or large ESD has limited its wide adoption. Mitomycin C (MMC), halofuginone (Hal), and transforming growth factor β3 (TGF-β3) exhibits antiscarring effects that may prevent post-ESD stricture formation. METHODS Using endoscopic mucosectomy (EEM) technique, an 8- to 10-cm-long circumferential esophageal mucosal segment was excised in a porcine model. The site was either untreated (control, n = 6) or received 40 evenly distributed injections of antiscarring agent immediately and at weeks 1 and 2. High and low doses were used: MMC 5 mg (n = 2), 0.5 mg (n = 2); Hal 5 mg (n = 2), 1.5 mg (n = 2), 0.5 mg (n = 2); TGF-β3 2 μg (n = 2), 0.5 μg (n = 2). The degree of stricture formation was determined by the percentage reduction of the esophageal lumen on weekly fluoroscopic examination. Animals were euthanized when strictures exceeded 80 % or the animals were unable to maintain weight. RESULTS The control group had a luminal diameter reduction of 78.2 ± 10.9 % by 2 weeks and were euthanized by week 3. Compared at 2 weeks, the Hal group showed a decrease in mean stricture formation (68.4 % low dose, 57.7 % high dose), while both TGF-β3 dosage groups showed no significant change (65.3 % low dose, 76.2 % high dose). MMC was most effective in stricture prevention (53.6 % low dose, 35 % high dose). Of concern, the esophageal wall treated with high-dose MMC appeared to be necrotic and eventually led to perforation. In contrast, low dose MMC, TGF-β3 and Hal treated areas appeared re-epithelialized and healthy. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary data on MMC and Hal demonstrated promise in reducing esophageal stricture formation after EEM. More animal data are needed to perform adequate statistical analysis in order to determine overall efficacy of antiscarring therapy.","Wu, Yuhsin; Schomisch, Steve J; Cipriano, Cassandra; Chak, Amitabh; Lash, Richard H; Ponsky, Jeffrey L; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3210-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24100858/,455

DESIGN Prospective, randomised, double blind controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Seventy-five participants who underwent CABG surgery with left internal mammary artery grafts were allocated, to the ropivacaine group (n=26), the sham group (n=25), or usual care group (n=24). Participants in the ropivacaine group received 0.5% ropivacaine and participants in the sham group received normal saline, both as continuous infusions via two parasternally tunnelled catheters for 96hours continuously. The usual care group did not receive a device. All groups had patient-controlled analgesia and/or oral analgesia. RESULTS Seventy-two participants completed the study. There was no significant between-group differences in pain scores, distance walked on any post operative day (POD) or number of participants discharged from physiotherapy by POD 4. For the group as a whole there was a significant linear decrease in pain score from mean (SD) 42 (24) mm on POD1 to 15 (16) mm on POD4 (p<0.001), (MD 27mm, 95% CI 22 to 32) and walking distance increased from 1 (5) m on POD1 to 183 (239) m on POD4 (p<0.001) MD 181m, 95% CI 126 to 236).

119721,Virtual teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-19,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a common and serious worldwide health problem. Despite all the advances in therapy, significant interest has focused on the identification of patients with CAP who require intensive care unit admission to improve their outcomes. The severity assessment of CAP provides an important guide to clinicians in deciding the site of care and the use of empiric antibiotics and adjuvant therapy. For years, several clinical assessment scores have been suggested and validated to achieve this goal. The recent introduction of biomarkers as prognostic indicators of severe CAP, whether used alone or in conjunction with other clinical severity of illness scores, has been investigated. An objective scoring system with a high level of sensitivity and specificity to predict the severity of CAP and the need for high levels of care do not exist. Today, the addition of clinical scores and biomarkers to clinical judgment is the best approach to optimize the care of severe CAP. Future research will allow validation of these and newer tools to improve the prognosis of patients with CAP.","Fernandez, Juan F; Sibila, Oriol; Restrepo, Marcos I",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1586/ecp.12.28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22943124/,455

After minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE); however, earlier return to normal function may render patients better able to receive adjuvant therapy. We examined whether primary MIE followed by adjuvant chemotherapy influenced survival compared with propensity-matched patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS Patients with stage II or higher EAC treated with MIE (N = 375) were identified. Using 30 pretreatment covariates, propensity for assignment to either neoadjuvant followed by MIE (n = 183; 54%) or MIE as primary therapy (n = 156; 46%) was calculated, generating 97 closely matched pairs. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, comorbidity, and final pathologic stage. RESULTS In propensity-matched pairs, adjusted hazard ratio for death did not differ significantly for primary MIE compared with neoadjuvant (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.16). Recurrence patterns were similar between groups and 65% of patients with IIb or greater pathologic stage received adjuvant therapy. Clinical staging was inaccurate in 37 out of 105 patients (35%) who underwent primary MIE (n = 18 upstaged and n = 19 downstaged). CONCLUSIONS Primary MIE followed by adjuvant chemotherapy guided by pathologic findings did not negatively influence survival and allowed for accurate staging compared with clinical staging. Our data suggest that primary MIE in patients with resectable EAC may be a reasonable approach, improving stage-based prognostication and potentially minimizing overtreatment in patients with early stage disease through accurate stage assignments. A randomized controlled trial testing this hypothesis is needed.","Zahoor, Haris; Luketich, James D; Levy, Ryan M; Awais, Omar; Winger, Daniel G; Gibson, Michael K; Nason, Katie S",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.10.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25454907/,455

It creates unprecedented or unanticipated human health problems in various places or times of the year. Africa is the world's second largest and most populous continent and has relatively changeable weather conditions. The present study aims to investigate the impact of weather conditions, heat and humidity on the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic in various regions of Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study, 16 highly populated countries from North, South, East, West, and Central African regions were selected. The data on COVID-19 pandemic including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from World Health Organization. The daily temperature and humidity figures were obtained from the weather web ""Time and Date"". The daily cases, deaths, temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)"" in the African region, from Feb 14 to August 2, 2020. RESULTS In African countries, the daily basis mean temperature from Feb 14, 2020 to August 2, 2020 was 26.16±0.12°C, and humidity was 57.41±0.38%. The overall results revealed a significant inverse correlation between humidity and the number of cases (r= -0.192, p<0.001) and deaths (r= -0.213, p<0.001). Similarly, a significant inverse correlation was found between temperature and the number of cases (r= -0.25, p<0.001) and deaths (r=-0.18, p<0.001). Furthermore, the regression results showed that with 1% increase in humidity the number of cases and deaths was significantly reduced by 3.6% and 3.7% respectively. Congruently, with 1°C increase in temperature, the number of cases and deaths was also significantly reduced by 15.1% and 10.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Increase in relative humidity and temperature was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic in various African countries. The study findings on weather events and COVID-19 pandemic have an impact at African regional levels to project the incidence and mortality trends with regional weather events which will enhance public health readiness and assist in planning to fight against this pandemic.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Aljudi, T W; Bajri, H M; Sami, W; Akram, J; Akram, S J; Hajjar, W",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_23069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015822/,455

It is initially difficult for surgeons with limited experience to perform the surgery. We describe two cases of left adrenalectomy with a LESS combined with the addition of an accessory port. After a 2.5-cm skin incision was made at the level of the paraumbilicus to insert the primary 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope, a 5-mm nonbladed trocar was placed through the skin incision side-by-side with the primary trocar. A second 3-mm nonbladed trocar was then placed along the anterior axillary line; a multichannel trocar was not used as a single port. Both adrenalectomies were completed successfully. In patients with a minor adrenal tumor, a combined technique using LESS and an additional port is easier than LESS alone and may, therefore, be a bridge between the conventional laparoscopic approach and LESS.","Sumino, Yasuhiro; Nakano, Daisaku; Mori, Ken-Ichi; Nomura, Takeo; Sato, Fuminori; Mimata, Hiromitsu",Case reports in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/651380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541182/,455

The timescales of such processes are investigated in collisions of atomic nuclei using fully microscopic approaches. Results from time-dependent Hartree-Fock and time-dependent random-phase approximation calculations are compared for 13 systems over a broad range of energies. The timescale for full mass equilibration (∼2×10^{-20} s) is found to be much larger than timescales for neutron-to-proton equilibration, kinetic energy, and angular momentum dissipations which are on the order of 10^{-21} s. Fluctuations of mass numbers in the fragments and correlations between their neutron and proton numbers build up within only a few 10^{-21} s. This indicates that dissipation is basically not impacted by mass equilibration, but is mostly driven by the exchange of nucleons between the fragments.","Simenel, C; Godbey, K; Umar, A S",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.212504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530651/,455

We aimed to systematically review the prevalence of liver involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at their hospital admission, and its correlation with disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with or without pre-existing chronic liver disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, PMC, clinical trial registries, and other Coronavirus family publications for studies reporting data on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 and liver function tests (LFTs) alterations, as well as clinical course of patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Case reports, preprints, editorials, reviews were excluded. We also revised literature to describe the background of liver involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS 36 studies, including 20724 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were included. The pooled prevalence of LFTs abnormalities at admission was 46.9% (AST 26.5%, ALT 22.8%, GGT 22.5%, ALP 5.7%, tBIL 8.0%). ALT, AST, tBIL were independent predictors of disease severity (ALT OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.17-2.03; AST OR 3.17, 95% CI 2.10-4.77; tBIL OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.18-4.58) and in-hospital mortality (ALT OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.96; AST OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.68-7.18; tBIL OR 7.75, 95% CI 2.28-26.40). Heterogeneity among studies was high. The few available data also reported that COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of liver decompensation and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS LFTs alterations were reported in up to 47% of unselected patients with COVID-19 and were associated with severe disease or in-hospital mortality. In cirrhotic patients, COVID-19 was associated with high risk of liver decompensation or mortality.","Del Zompo, F; De Siena, M; Ianiro, G; Gasbarrini, A; Pompili, M; Ponziani, F R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378061/,455

These findings encouraged us to use rLdccys1 in the immunotherapy of naturally infected dogs from Teresina, Piauí, a region of high incidence of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Thirty naturally infected mongrel dogs displaying clinical signs of visceral leishmaniasis were randomly divided in three groups: one group received three doses of rLdccys1 in combination with the adjuvant Propionibacterium acnes at one month interval between each dose; a second group received three doses of P. acnes alone; a third group received saline. The main findings were: 1) dogs that received rLdccys1 with P. acnes did not display increase of the following clinical signs: weight loss, alopecia, onychogryphosis, cachexia, anorexia, apathy, skin lesions, hyperkeratosis, ocular secretion, and enlarged lymph nodes; they also exhibited a significant reduction in the spleen parasite load in comparison to the control dogs; 2) rLdccys1-treated dogs exhibited a significant delayed type cutaneous hypersensitivity elicited by the recombinant antigen, as well as high IgG2 serum titers and low IgG1 serum titers; sera from rLdccys1-treated dogs also contained high IFN-γ and low IL-10 concentrations; 3) control dogs exhibited all of the clinical signs of visceral leishmaniasis and had low serum IgG2 and IFN-γ levels and high concentrations of IgG1 and IL-10; 4) all of the dogs treated with rLdccys1 were alive 12 months after treatment, whereas dogs which received either saline or P. acnes alone died within 3 to 7 months. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These findings illustrate the potential use of rLdccys1 as an additional tool for the immunotherapy of canine visceral leishmaniasis and support further studies designed to improve the efficacy of this recombinant antigen for the treatment of this neglected disease.","Ferreira, Josie Haydée Lima; Silva, Lucilene Dos Santos; Longo-Maugéri, Ieda Maria; Katz, Simone; Barbiéri, Clara Lúcia",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625516/,455

132384,Temporal and spatial variable in-stream attenuation of selected pharmaceuticals.,2020-11-01,"Background: Thyroid nodules are an extremely common occurrence, as their prevalence in the general population is estimated to range between 50 and 70%. Some of these nodules are autonomously functioning such that they can cause hyperthyroidism over time. In this case, surgery and radioiodine represent the standard of care. Nevertheless, patients might have contraindications or be unwilling to undergo these treatments. Minimally-invasive ultrasound-guided techniques, such as laser and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been recently introduced into clinical practice as an alternative treatment for symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Due to their efficacy and tolerability, these techniques have become increasingly available and their usage has been extended also to autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). Methods: In this narrative review, we will describe the studies reporting the therapeutic effects of RFA on AFTN, the studies reporting how RFA compares to the other treatment modalities, as well as the current indications for the use of RFA in patients with AFTN. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature search was independently conducted by three investigators on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception up to February 2020 to identify published articles concerning the effects of RFA on AFTN. Results and Conclusions: Current consensus statements and guidelines support the notion that RFA should be regarded as a first-line therapy for non-functioning benign thyroid nodules, while it remains a valid second-line option for AFTN treatment in case of contraindications or patient unwillingness to undergo surgery or radioiodine.","Cesareo, Roberto; Palermo, Andrea; Pasqualini, Valerio; Manfrini, Silvia; Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Stacul, Fulvio; Fabris, Bruno; Bernardi, Stella",Frontiers in endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528412/,455

Outbreaks of infectious disease continue to demonstrate the need for simple, sensitive, and translatable tests for point-of-care use. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an attractive alternative to conventional approaches for microfluidic device manufacturing based on injection molding; however, there is a need for development and validation of new AM process capabilities and materials that are compatible with microfluidic diagnostics. In this paper, we demonstrate the development and characterization of AM cartridges using continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) and investigate process characteristics and capabilities of the AM microfluidic device manufacturing. We find that CLIP accurately produces microfluidic channels as small as 400 μm and that it is possible to routinely produce fluid channels as small as 100 μm with high repeatability. We also developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for detection of E. coli from whole blood directly on the CLIP-based AM microfluidic cartridges, with a 50 cfu/μL limit of detection, validating the use of CLIP processes and materials for pathogen detection. The portable diagnostic platform presented in this paper could be used to investigate and validate other AM processes for microfluidic diagnostics and could be an important component of scaling up the diagnostics for current and future infectious diseases and pandemics.","Berger, Jacob; Aydin, Mehmet Y; Stavins, Robert; Heredia, John; Mostafa, Ariana; Ganguli, Anurup; Valera, Enrique; Bashir, Rashid; King, William P",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251790/,455
133865,Field Reliability Estimation for Cochlear Implants.,2015,"BACKGROUND Ileocecal interposition (ICI) for first-line reconstruction after low anterior colorectal resection was introduced by von Flüe and Harder in 1994 (Dis Colon Rectum 37:1160-1162, 1994). We report our experience using this technique to bridge colonic gaps after significant loss of bowel length. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1999 and 2009 the left-sided colon was too short for traditional isoperistaltic reconstruction in six patients treated in our hospital. Reasons for extensive bowel loss were a deficient (n = 3) or torn (n = 1) marginal artery with ischemia or repeat colorectal resections (n = 2). An ICI was done to bridge the gap and enable restoration of intestinal continuity. RESULTS No patient died. Whenever performing a coloanal anastomosis (4/6) a loop ileostomy was raised. One patient with colonic diversion experienced graft-related complications: ischemic colitis of the interposed colonic segment, anastomotic stenosis, and a presacral sinus were observed and managed nonoperatively. Subsequent closure of the stoma was possible in all cases. A median Vaizey incontinence score of 9 (range: 4-14) was recorded in the patient with coloanal anastomosis. The average number of bowel movements per day was 1.5 (range: 0.5-6). CONCLUSIONS When the descending colon does not reach the rectal stump or anal canal in reoperative cases or after vascular complication, ICI is a useful salvage procedure resulting in good bowel function.","Dauser, B; Riss, S; Stopfer, J; Herbst, F",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1337-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072431/,455

To meet the unprecedented demand for patient care, NYC H+H redeployed staff to the areas of greatest need and redesigned recruiting, onboarding, and training processes. The hospital system engaged private staffing agencies, partnered with the U.S Department of Defense, and recruited volunteers throughout the country. A centralized onboarding team created a single-source portal for medical providers requiring credentialing and established new staff positions to increase efficiency. Using new educational tools focused on COVID-19 content, the hospital system trained 20,000 staff, including nearly 9,000 nurses, within a two-month period. Creation of multidisciplinary teams, frequent enterprise-wide communication, willingness to shift direction in response to changing needs, and innovative use of technology were the key factors that enabled the hospital system to meet its goals.

134660,Evaluation of pathogen concentration in anaerobic digestate using a predictive modelling approach (ADRISK).,2021-08-10,"A growing number of pulmonary and critical care medicine fellowship programs in the United States offer global health training opportunities. Formal, integrated global health programs within pulmonary and critical care fellowships are relatively new but are built on principles and ideals of global health that focus on the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and social justice. Although core competencies consistent with these overarching themes in global health education have not been formalized for pulmonary and critical care trainees, relevant competency areas include clinical knowledge, international research training, cultural competency, and clinical and research capacity building. Existing global health education in U.S. pulmonary and critical care medicine training programs can generally be classified as one of three different models: integrated global health tracks, global health electives, and additional research years. Successful global health education programs foster partnerships and collaborations with international sites that emphasize bidirectional exchange. This bidirectional exchange includes ongoing, equitable commitments to mutual opportunities for training and professional development, including a focus on the particular knowledge and skill sets critical for addressing the unique priorities of individual countries. However, barriers related to the availability of mentorship, funding, and dedicated time exist to expanding global health education in pulmonary and critical care medicine. The implementation of global health training within pulmonary and critical care medicine programs requires continued optimization, but this training is essential to prepare the next generation of physicians to address the global aspects of respiratory disease and critical illness.","Siddharthan, Trishul; North, Crystal M; Attia, Engi F; Christiani, David C; Checkley, William; West, T Eoin",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201601-028ps; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26974557/,455

The relationship between ACEs and child health among CPS-involved children and the role of primary care providers (PCPs) in moderating this relationship is unknown. METHODS We conducted a convergent mixed-methods study of caregivers of children age 2 to 12 years with a CPS finding of physical abuse, modeling the association between cumulative ACEs and child health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the PedsQL4.0, a validated 23-item survey of multidimensional health, with and without the moderator of a patient-centered medical home. Interviews elicited descriptions of a child's experience with ACEs, the impact of ACEs on child health, and the role of a PCP in this context. RESULTS One hundred seventy-eight surveyed caregivers reported a mean of 5.5 (±3.3) ACE exposures per child. In a fully adjusted model, each ACE resulted in a 1.3-point (95% confidence interval: 0.7-2.0) reduction in HRQoL, a clinically important difference in HRQoL associated with ACE exposures. This association was explained by reduced psychosocial HRQoL and was not moderated by a patient-centered medical home. Twenty-seven interviewed caregivers described the influence of ACEs on a child's health. Many felt that a trusted PCP could support a child's well-being after such experiences. CONCLUSIONS Children with CPS involvement have ACE exposures that are associated with reduced HRQoL. Although PCPs are often unaware of CPS involvement or other ACEs, many caregivers welcome the support of a child's PCP in improving child well-being after adversity.","Campbell, Kristine A; Gamarra, Elizabeth; Frost, Caren J; Choi, Bom; Keenan, Heather T",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-0638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938778/,455

Lowered gluteal muscle oxygenation (SgmO2) may be demonstrated by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Purpose To evaluate NIRS-determined SgmO2 in EVAR patients. Material and Methods NIRS-determined SgmO2 was used in an observational study design (n = 17). From the ambulatory setting, seven EVAR patients were included with reported gluteal claudication from medical records. In 10 patients scheduled for EVAR, SgmO2 was measured before and after the procedure. NIRS sensors were applied bilaterally on the gluteal region. Treadmill walking (12% incline, 2.4 km/h) was introduced to stress gluteal muscles. Results A reduced SgmO2 with regional side difference (P < 0.05) was noted in all 10 patients following EVAR and four reported gluteal claudication. In patients with gluteal claudication (n = 7), treadmill decreased SgmO2. The time to recover the SgmO2 was prolonged for tissue exposed to occluded hypogastric artery (median = 512 s, range = 73-1207 s vs. median = 137, range = 0-643 s; P = 0.046). Conclusions EVAR affects gluteal muscle oxygenation. NIRS could be used to assess whether gluteal claudication is related to lowered SgmO2.","Taudorf, Mikkel; Nielsen, Michael B; Schroeder, Torben V; Lönn, Lars; Nielsen, Henning B",Acta radiologica open,https://doi.org/10.1177/2058460119850115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31205755/,455
142170,Design an easy-to-use infection screening system for non-contact monitoring of vital-signs to prevent the spread of pandemic diseases.,2014,"OBJECTIVE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global surge in critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, some of whom may benefit from tracheostomy. Decisions on if, when, and how to perform tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 have major implications for patients, clinicians, and hospitals. We investigated the tracheostomy protocols and practices that institutions around the world have put into place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA SOURCES Protocols for tracheostomy in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from individual institutions (n = 59) were obtained from the United States and 25 other countries, including data from several low- and middle-income countries, 23 published or society-endorsed protocols, and 36 institutional protocols. REVIEW METHODS The comparative document analysis involved cross-sectional review of institutional protocols and practices. Data sources were analyzed for timing of tracheostomy, contraindications, preoperative testing, personal protective equipment (PPE), surgical technique, and postoperative management. CONCLUSIONS Timing of tracheostomy varied from 3 to >21 days, with over 90% of protocols recommending 14 days of intubation prior to tracheostomy. Most protocols advocate delaying tracheostomy until COVID-19 testing was negative. All protocols involved use of N95 or higher PPE. Both open and percutaneous techniques were reported. Timing of tracheostomy changes ranged from 5 to >30 days postoperatively, sometimes contingent on negative COVID-19 test results. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Wide variation exists in tracheostomy protocols, reflecting geographical variation, different resource constraints, and limited data to drive evidence-based care standards. Findings presented herein may provide reference points and a framework for evolving care standards.","Bier-Laning, Carol; Cramer, John D; Roy, Soham; Palmieri, Patrick A; Amin, Ayman; Añon, José Manuel; Bonilla-Asalde, Cesar A; Bradley, Patrick J; Chaturvedi, Pankaj; Cognetti, David M; Dias, Fernando; Di Stadio, Arianna; Fagan, Johannes J; Feller-Kopman, David J; Hao, Sheng-Po; Kim, Kwang Hyun; Koivunen, Petri; Loh, Woei Shyang; Mansour, Jobran; Naunheim, Matthew R; Schultz, Marcus J; Shang, You; Sirjani, Davud B; St John, Maie A; Tay, Joshua K; Vergez, Sébastien; Weinreich, Heather M; Wong, Eddy W Y; Zenk, Johannes; Rassekh, Christopher H; Brenner, Michael J",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820961985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138722/,455

It is still threatening the world population. Here, we aimed to produce hyperimmune sera that contain immunoglobulin G and F(ab')2 fragments sourced from horse antibodies as an urgent response to the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS SARS-CoV-2 was produced and inactivated with three different methods [formaldehyde (FA), formaldehyde and binary ethylene amine (FA+BEI), and heat treatment]. After in vitro inactivation control, immunogens were mixed with Freund?s adjuvant, thereafter horses (n: 2 for FA, 4 for FA + BEI, 2 for Heat inactivation) and New Zealand rabbits (n: 6 for FA, 6 for FA + BEI, 6 for Heat inactivation) were immunized four times. Neutralizing antibody levels of the sera were measured at the 4th, 6th and 8th weeks. When the antibodies were detected at the peak level, plasma was collected from horses and hyperimmune sera procured after the purification process. RESULTS Horses and rabbits produced highly neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in FA and FA + BEI inactivation groups, foreign proteins were removed effectively after purification. CONCLUSION This study presents a profitable practice to develop horse specific antisera against SARS-CoV-2 for emergency and low-cost response. In further studies, new purification methods can be used to increase the efficiency of the final product.","Pakdemirli, Ahu; Çalişkan, Elvin; Hacioğlu, Sabri; Danyer, Erdem; Kardoğan, Özlem; Ergün Kurt, Züleyha; Yildirim, Özcan; Taşkaya, Hakan; Ündar, Bora; Sezgin, Yasemin; Ergin, Gencay; Ekici, Himmet; Ülker, Ufuk; Taçbaş, Erkan; Çakir, Şahin; Bülbül, Ramazan; Bebek, Mustafa; Sarper, Meral; Dülger, Dilek; Sari, Ümmü Sena; Ergin, Fatma; Kabakli, Özden; Yarali, Cevdet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2101-304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092050/,455

149383,Corona crisis and politics: Thoughts from the BVDD and the DDG.,2020-05-01,"The COVID-19 outbreak deeply changed our lives on different levels. Social restrictions and distancing shaped in a different way our view of social relationships and behaviours. Like many aspects of daily life, also education has undergone radical changes. Nursing care was strongly affected by the outbreak, not only due to the risks in everyday practice, the heavy workload or the impact on nurses' daily lives outside the healthcare settings, but also because nursing is caring profession and it embeds in its roots the close relationship with the patient, the touch, the patients' body proximity as a way to communicate and to deliver an effective nursing care. All these issues, when brought in nursing education are also a learning opportunity for students and a way to develop their professional identity and to focusing on the nursing role. The COVID-19 outbreak heavily hit the clinical learning environments, as they are healthcare settings. The situation affected students' learning opportunities, since clinical placements were suspended, Universities closed and in-person courses moved into online teaching. While lessons and courses rapidly switched into online teaching, in order to safeguard students' education and faculty's activity, it was not possible to manage the pre-clinical activities, such as simulations and labs, in order to support technical and relational competences. Most of all, it was not possible to arrange the clinical placements due to the uncertainty of the healthcare settings and the social and organizational restrictions to limiting unnecessary accesses to the services, as recommended by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2020.Recently, many authors have explored the issues related to the future of nursing education. In detail, an emerging issue is how it will be possible to educating nurses in a society facing isolation and social distance measures, but at the same time, in a society that needs more and more prepared clinical nurses.","Tomietto, Marco; Comparcini, Dania; Simonetti, Valentina; Cicolini, Giancarlo",Professioni infermieristiche,https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2020.733131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355772/,455

The SARS COV2 pandemic highlighted weaknesses in the American healthcare system. This article explores the ability of American healthcare to adapt to this challenge. RECENT FINDINGS With the COVID-19 pandemic, intensivists, and ventilators have been identified as the most critical components leading to shortages in ICU capacity. Anesthesiologists play a unique role in being able to provide 'flex capacity' with critical care staffing, space, and equipment (post-anesthesia care units, operating rooms ventilators). With the advent of APPs, intensive care physician staffing ratios may potentially be increased to cover patients safely in a physician-led team model. Tele-medicine expands this further and can allow hospital coordination for optimizing ICU bed use. SUMMARY Although intensivists have been able to take care of the increased ICU caseload during the COVID-19 pandemic through recruiting other specialties, the question of what is the appropriate staffing model for the future is yet to be elucidated. Creating stronger multidisciplinary care teams that have the capacity to flex up critical care capacity may be the most prudent longer-term solution.","Hussain, Rashid S; Kataria, Tripti C",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606396/,455
154533,Driving mechanisms of gross primary productivity geographical patterns for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau lake systems.,2021-06-05,"The idea behind the marine cloud-brightening (MCB) geoengineering technique is that seeding marine stratocumulus clouds with copious quantities of roughly monodisperse sub-micrometre sea water particles might significantly enhance the cloud droplet number concentration, and thereby the cloud albedo and possibly longevity. This would produce a cooling, which general circulation model (GCM) computations suggest could-subject to satisfactory resolution of technical and scientific problems identified herein-have the capacity to balance global warming up to the carbon dioxide-doubling point. We describe herein an account of our recent research on a number of critical issues associated with MCB. This involves (i) GCM studies, which are our primary tools for evaluating globally the effectiveness of MCB, and assessing its climate impacts on rainfall amounts and distribution, and also polar sea-ice cover and thickness; (ii) high-resolution modelling of the effects of seeding on marine stratocumulus, which are required to understand the complex array of interacting processes involved in cloud brightening; (iii) microphysical modelling sensitivity studies, examining the influence of seeding amount, seed-particle salt-mass, air-mass characteristics, updraught speed and other parameters on cloud-albedo change; (iv) sea water spray-production techniques; (v) computational fluid dynamics studies of possible large-scale periodicities in Flettner rotors; and (vi) the planning of a three-stage limited-area field research experiment, with the primary objectives of technology testing and determining to what extent, if any, cloud albedo might be enhanced by seeding marine stratocumulus clouds on a spatial scale of around 100×100 km. We stress that there would be no justification for deployment of MCB unless it was clearly established that no significant adverse consequences would result. There would also need to be an international agreement firmly in favour of such action.","Latham, John; Bower, Keith; Choularton, Tom; Coe, Hugh; Connolly, Paul; Cooper, Gary; Craft, Tim; Foster, Jack; Gadian, Alan; Galbraith, Lee; Iacovides, Hector; Johnston, David; Launder, Brian; Leslie, Brian; Meyer, John; Neukermans, Armand; Ormond, Bob; Parkes, Ben; Rasch, Phillip; Rush, John; Salter, Stephen; Stevenson, Tom; Wang, Hailong; Wang, Qin; Wood, Rob","Philosophical transactions.

Research has indicated the impact on frontlines workers, yet little is known about the impact on those who were not working outside the home or switched to working remotely. Purpose The purpose of this report is to identify the financial and healthcare issues and mental health impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on Appalachians by worker categories. Methods An online survey was administered from May 8 - June 6, 2020 to a convenience sample of previous research participants and shared through social media networks, i.e., snowball sampling. Questions investigated mental health, financial and healthcare issues, and employment status. Survey responses were summarized by percentages overall and by working categories. Results Of the 751 participants, 276 (42%) resided in Appalachia. After removing 17 who lost their job due to COVID-19, 59 (23%) indicated not working outside the home prior to COVID-19, whereas 111 (43%) and 89 (34%) switched to working remotely and continued working outside the home during the shutdown. Respondents were predominately Caucasian and female. Nearly a quarter of participants had lost or reduced income due to the shutdown. Approximately half missed or postponed healthcare appointments. Mental health impacts were similar across the groups, with half of the respondents reporting anxiety due to COVID-19. Implications Further research is needed to explore health outcomes associated with missed healthcare appointments during the shutdown. Mental health support may be needed equally by those isolated at home and frontline workers.","Haynes, Erin N; Hilbert, Timothy J; Westneat, Susan; Leger, Kate A; Keynton, Katie; Bush, Heather",Journal of Appalachian health,https://doi.org/10.13023/jah.0301.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768206/,455

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery has recently became popular on behalf of inventing less invasive procedures. In this paper, we present a case of Pure SILS Nissen Fundoplication. Patient and Methods. In February 2010 a 29-year old male patient with a 4 cm sliding hiatus hernia presenting with reflux symptoms had undergone a standard floppy Nissen Fundoplication with a hiatus repair via single 2 cm incision in umbilicus. Results. The procedure had obeyed the standard natural orifice surgery rules, and no needlescopic assistance for any stage of the operation was used so to be a pure single-incision procedure. The operation lasted for 120 minutes without any need of conversion, and the patient was discharged the following day of operation. Conclusion. In the recent time, hybrid single incision laparoscopy techniques have been defined with the use of extra-abdominal supplements for retraction of liver or stomach for Nissen procedure. In addition the main issue in single-incision upper GI and/or hiatus surgery is still the retraction of liver.

Depending on the pathogen invading the body, specific immune responses are built up that are crucial for eliminating the pathogen from the host. Host recognition of invading microorganisms relies on evolutionarily ancient, germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are highly expressed on the cell surface of DCs, of which the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are well characterized and recognize bacterial or viral components. Moreover, they bind a variety of self-proteins released from damaged tissues including several heat-shock proteins. The membrane-associated C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) recognize glycan structures expressed by host cells of the immune system or on specific tissues, which upon recognition allow cellular interactions between DCs and other immune or tissue cells. In addition, CLRs can function as PRRs. In contrast to TLRs, CLRs recognize carbohydrate structures present on the pathogens. Modification of glycan structures on pathogens to mimic host glycans can thereby alter CLR interactions that subsequently modifies DC-induced polarization. In this review, we will discuss in detail how specific glycosylation of antigens can dictate both the innate and adaptive interactions that are mediated by CLRs on DCs and how this balances immune activation and inhibition of DC function.","van Vliet, Sandra J; García-Vallejo, Juan J; van Kooyk, Yvette",Immunology and cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/icb.2008.55; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18679407/,455

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may eradicate subclinical nodal metastases and reduce the extent of axillary surgery performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS A query of the National Cancer Database Participant User File was performed for new cases of female breast cancer from 2012 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were clinical N0 status, receipt of chemotherapy, and receipt of axillary surgery. Exclusions included hormone-positive/HER2-negative tumors and/or distant metastatic disease. Subjects were divided into groups by receipt of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary end point was the extent of axillary surgery, defined as sentinel lymph node biopsy alone or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Subgroup analyses were performed on the basis of tumor phenotype and surgery of the primary site. RESULTS A total of 66,771 female patients were included, 15,967 of whom underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ALND rates were higher in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (30.6% vs. 28.8%, P < .001). Among tumor phenotypes, the extent of axillary surgery was reduced most significantly for hormone-negative, HER2-positive disease (30.0% vs. 25.8%, P < .001). ALND rates were more substantially reduced for patients who underwent mastectomy (41.3% vs. 36.1%, P < .001) compared to partial mastectomy (21.8% vs. 20.1%, P = .002). Adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent predictor of ALND (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.33). CONCLUSION Neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the extent of axillary surgery in clinically node-negative, nonluminal breast cancers.","Thompson, Jessica L; Wrubel, Erica; Davis, Alan T; Koehler, Tracy; Chung, Mathew H; Wright, G Paul",Clinical breast cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444317/,455

A 70-year-old man with right lung cancer underwent staging FDG PET/CT, which demonstrated an avid right lung mass with avid hilar and mediastinal nodes. Avid left axillary nodes of benign configuration were also noted. The patient had the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination in the left arm a week earlier. On reflection, the axillary nodes were concluded to be reactive related to this. This is a potential COVID-19 vaccination associated pitfall on PET/CT that should be considered when interpreting FDG PET/CT images.","Nawwar, Ayah Adel; Searle, Julie; Hopkins, Richard; Lyburn, Iain Douglas",Clinical nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/rlu.0000000000003657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883486/,455

Lockdowns all over the world have resulted in social isolation and whole populations started to live a new social norm.ObjectivesIn this presentation I will discuss the role social media has played in social interactions during lockdown. Mainly if social media use has replaced social face to face interactions. This both in terms of quantity and emotional quality of interactions. I will be using a study we conducted in Malta in this regard.MethodsIt seems that social media use has increased during lockdown. To analyse this in Malta we studied a dataset comprising more than 50,000 comments and more than 150,000 interactions that has been extracted from Facebook covering a time span of four months. These months were the first wave of COVID- 19 cases in Malta. We conducted a quantitative and qualitative data analysis to establish the social polarity of the content.ResultsI will discuss how social media has in part replaced the social face to face interactions during COVID- 19 pandemic initial months, and use the results of the study we conducted in Malta as an example.ConclusionsIt would be useful to analyse further the use of social media in the new social norm caused by COVID- 19. Most importantly how it could be used to decrease social isolation effectively and increase psychological wellbeing.","Grech, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.714,455
167426,Peer review declaration,2021,"It is an honor to receive comments from such an esteemed group of scholars, and their recognition of the progress in motivational sciences catalyzed by a global community of self-determination theory (SDT) researchers. Given limited space, we respond to only a few of their reactions. In our legacy article (Ryan et al., 2021), we focused on autonomy, in part because, as Koestner and Holding (2021) highlighted, SDT is unique in its emphasis on this concept. Koestner and Holding further suggested that SDT's emphasis on autonomy has a particular salience in this age of COVID-19 in which voluntary compliance matters to public health. We agree, and have seen SDT's ability to differentiate between autonomy and ""freedom,"" and to identify strategies that facilitate maintained behavior change to be highly relevant in this pandemic (e.g., Martela et al., 2021;Vermote et al., 2021). Concerning this emphasis on autonomy, Sheldon and Geoffredi (2021) worried that SDT faces a ""major threat"" from determinists who object to ""free will."" Patall (2021) comments about the wide applicability of SDT's ""universal"" principles. Vallerand (2021) points to major contributions of SDT in focusing on basic human needs, in differentiating types of extrinsic motivation, and in researching human flourishing well before the advent of positive psychology. Sansone and Tang (2021) highlight the complexity of SDT's motivational taxonomy, and that people can have both betweenand within-person differences in configurations of motives. We appreciate these positive reviews of SDT, and agree with our commentators' unanimous view that the theory's work is far from complete. We hope our SDT legacy article thus serves not as a coda, but instead as a springboard for yet further theorizing, experimentation, and interventions that contribute to humanity through supporting people's autonomy and capacity to pursue what really matters to them.

Their precise function remains unclear, but some studies have shown that they support male fertility. The important role of phasiRNAs in anthers underpins our current study to their characterization in wheat and barley anthers. In this study, we staged anthers at every 0.2 mm of development for one wheat and two barley varieties. We isolated pre-meiotic (0.2 mm, 0.4 mm and 0.6 mm), meiotic (0.8 mm, 1.0 mm and 1.4 mm) and post-meiotic (1.8 mm) anthers for which we then investigated accumulation patterns of RNAs, including reproductive phasiRNAs. We annotated a total 12,821 and 2,897 PHAS loci in the wheat and barley genomes, respectively. When comparing the total number of PHAS loci in genomes of maize, rice, barley and wheat, we characterized an expansion of reproductive PHAS loci in the genomes of Poaceae subfamilies from Panicoideae to Oryzoideae and to Poideae. In addition to the two classes of pre-meiotic (21-nt) and meiotic (24-nt) phasiRNAs, previously described in maize and rice anthers, we described a group of 24-nt phasiRNAs that accumulate in pre-meiotic anthers. The absence of pre-meiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs in maize and rice suggests a divergence in grass species of the Poideae subfamily. Additionally, we performed a co-expression gene analysis describing the regulation of phasiRNA biogenesis in wheat and barley anthers. We highlight AGO9 and AGO6 as candidate binding partners of pre-meiotic and meiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs, respectively. One sentence summary In wheat and barley anthers, 24-nt reproductive phasiRNAs are abundant in both meiotic and pre-meiotic stages.","Bélanger, Sébastien; Pokhrel, Suresh; Czymmek, Kirk; Meyers, Blake C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.160440,455
174089,Virtual Disclaimer,2020,"Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is an improvement in visual function following training. Although the practical utility of VPL was once thought to be limited by its specificity to the precise stimuli used during training, more recent work has shown that such specificity can be overcome with appropriate training protocols. In contrast, relatively little is known about the extent to which VPL exhibits motor specificity. Indeed, previous studies have shown that training paradigms that require one type of response (e.g., a button press) do not necessarily transfer to those that require a different response (e.g., a mouse movement). In this work, we have examined the effector specificity of VPL by training observers on tasks that maintain the same visual stimuli and task structure, but that require different effectors to indicate the response. We find that, in these conditions, VPL transfers fully between manual and oculomotor responses. These results are consistent with the idea that VPL entails the learning of a decision rule that can generalize across effectors.","Awada, Asmara; Bakhtiari, Shahab; Pack, Christopher C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.10.291674,455

It is demonstrated using weekly quantile forecasts of changes in the number of US COVID-19 deaths. Empirical quantiles are derived using the assumption that daily changes in a variable follow a normal distribution with time varying means and standard deviations, which can be assumed constant over short horizons such as one week. These empirical quantiles are used to evaluate quantile forecasts using the Mean Squared Quantile Score (MSQS), which, in turn, is decomposed into sub-components involving bias, resolution and error variation to identify specific aspects of performance, which highlight the strengths and weaknesses of forecasts. The framework is then extended to test if performance enhancement can be achieved by combining diverse forecasts from different sources. The demonstration illustrates that the technique can effectively evaluate quantile forecasting performance based on a limited number of data points, which is crucial in emergency situations such as forecasting pandemic behavior. It also shows that combining the predictions with quantile probability forecasts generated from an Autoregressive Order One, AR(1) model provided substantially improved performance. The implications of these findings are discussed, suggestions are offered for future research and potential limitations are considered.","Thomson, Mary E.; Pollock, Andrew C.; Murray, Jennifer",Eurasian Journal of Business and Management,https://doi.org/10.15604/ejbm.2021.09.02.004,455
187023,A wireless PDA-based physiological monitoring system for patient transport.,2004,"OBJECTIVE We investigated the association of the metabolic syndrome with new-onset diabetes in the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We followed up on 1,679 subjects without diabetes at baseline. Those with a previous diagnosis of diabetes or those who were receiving drug treatment were considered to be diabetic. The remaining subjects underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Diabetes was defined by plasma glucose > or =7.0 mmol/l with fasting and/or > or =11.1 mmol/l at 2 h. RESULTS The prevalences of the metabolic syndrome at baseline were 14.5 and 11.4%, respectively, according to U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. After a median of 6.4 years, there were 66 and 54 new cases of diabetes in men and women, respectively. The metabolic syndrome at baseline predicted incident diabetes. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the NCEP and IDF definitions of the syndrome were 4.1 [95% CI 2.8-6.0] and 3.5 [2.3-5.2], respectively. HRs for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > or =6.1 or 5.6 mmol/l were 6.9 [4.1-11.5] and 4.1 [2.8-6.0], respectively. The NCEP and IDF criteria had 41.9 and 31.7% sensitivity and 87.5 and 90.2% specificity, respectively. Their positive predictive values were low, approximately 20%, but their negative predictive values were approximately 95%. CONCLUSIONS The metabolic syndrome, particularly its component, elevated FPG, predicts diabetes in Chinese. An individual without the metabolic syndrome is unlikely to develop diabetes, but one who has it should practice therapeutic lifestyle changes and have periodic FPG measurements to detect new-onset diabetes.","Cheung, Bernard M Y; Wat, Nelson M S; Man, Yu Bun; Tam, Sidney; Thomas, G Neil; Leung, Gabriel M; Cheng, Chun Ho; Woo, Jean; Janus, Edward D; Lau, Chu Pak; Lam, Tai Hing; Lam, Karen S L",Diabetes care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17337491/,455

HCC patients (n＝397) consecutively treated with RFA (256 males, 141 females, median age 69 years) were enrolled. In these patients, 1,455 nodules (median size 17mm) were ablated. Predisposing factors for overall recurrence and local recurrence in the context of tumor location and complications were examined. Local recurrence was observed for 113 of the 1,455 nodules. The 1-, 3- and 5-year local recurrence rates were 2.2%, 7.4% and 9.5%, respectively. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that large tumor size (＞2cm), tumor location (adjacent to the major portal branch or hepatic vein), and small ablated margin (＜3mm) were independent predisposing factors for local recurrence after RFA (HR＝1.70-2.81). Tumor location (adjacent to the major portal branch, hepatic vein, or diaphragm) was also revealed as a risk factor for liver damage due to RFA. HCC adjacent to the major portal vein or hepatic vein was associated with a higher risk for local recurrence and for complications;therefore, special precautions are necessary when applying RFA to HCC near vessels even when the tumors are located at an easy-to-puncture site.","Toshimori, Junichi; Nouso, Kazuhiro; Nakamura, Shinichiro; Wada, Nozomu; Morimoto, Yuki; Takeuchi, Yasuto; Yasunaka, Tetsuya; Kuwaki, Kenji; Ohnishi, Hideki; Ikeda, Fusao; Shiraha, Hidenori; Takaki, Akinobu; Yamamoto, Kazuhide",Acta medica Okayama,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26289913/,455

METHODS We conducted a retrospective service evaluation between the 3rd March and the 5th May 2020 to describe and characterise the use of POCUS within an acute care pathway designed specifically for the assessment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. A novel POCUS severity scale was formulated by assessing pleural and interstitial abnormalities within six anatomical zones (three for each lung). An aggregated score was calculated for each patient and evaluated as a marker of disease severity using standard metrics of discriminatory performance. RESULTS POCUS was performed in the assessment of 100 patients presenting with suspected COVID-19. POCUS was consistent with COVID-19 infection in 92% (n = 92) of the patients assessed. Severity, as assessed by POCUS, showed good discriminatory performance to predict all-cause inpatient mortality, death or critical care admission, and escalated oxygen requirements (AUC .80, .80, 82). The risk of all-cause mortality in patients with scores in lowest quartile was 2.5% (95%CI 0.12- 12.95) compared with 42.9% (95CI 15.8 - 75.0%) in the highest quartile. POCUS assessed severity correlated with length of stay and duration of supplemental oxygen therapy. CONCLUSION A simple aggregated score formed by the summating the degree of pleural and interstitial change within six anatomical lung zones showed good discriminatory performance in predicting a range of adverse outcomes in patients with suspected COVID-19.","Knight, T; Edwards, L; Rajasekaran, A; Clare, S; Lasserson, D",Acute medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215172/,455

Development of new approaches for prevention of acute respiratory tract conditions requires studies of the etiologies of infections and quantification of the risk of hospitalization for vulnerable patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of specific virus infections associated with acute respiratory tract conditions leading to hospitalization of chronically ill patients. DESIGN Analysis of viral etiology of patients hospitalized with acute respiratory tract conditions between July 1991 and June 1995. SETTING Four large clinics and related hospitals serving diverse populations representative of Harris County, Texas. PATIENTS A total of 1029 patients who were hospitalized for pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or congestive heart failure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Virus infection, defined by culture, antigen detection, and significant rise in serum antibodies, by underlying condition; hospitalization rates by low- vs middle-income status. RESULTS Ninety-three percent of patients older than 5 years had a chronic underlying condition; a chronic pulmonary condition was most common. Patients with chronic pulmonary disease from low-income populations were hospitalized at a rate of 398.6 per 10000, almost 8 times higher than the rate for patients from middle-income groups (52.2 per 10000; P<.001). Of the 403 patients (44.4% of adults and 32.3% of children) who submitted convalescent serum specimens for antibody testing, respiratory tract virus infections were detected in 181 (44.9%). Influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections accounted for 75% of all virus infections. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that respiratory virus infections commonly trigger serious acute respiratory conditions that result in hospitalization of patients with chronic underlying conditions, highlighting the need for development of effective vaccines for these viruses, especially for parainfluenza and RSV.","Glezen, W P; Greenberg, S B; Atmar, R L; Piedra, P A; Couch, R B",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10659876/,455

The virus replicates in alveolar macrophages of infected pigs, resulting in pneumonia in growing pigs and late-term abortions in sows. Outbreaks occur on disparate farms within an area despite biosecurity measures, suggesting mechanical transport by arthropods. We investigated the vector potential of stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), in the transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus, PRRSV) under laboratory conditions. Stable flies were collected around PRRS-negative boar stud barns in North Carolina and tested for presence of the virus. Stable flies were collected on alsynite traps placed near the exhaust fan of the close-sided tunnel-ventilated buildings, suggesting blood seeking flies are attracted by olfactory cues. No flies were positive for PRRSV. We assessed transmission of the virus through an infective bite by feeding laboratory reared stable flies on blood containing virus and transferring them to naive pigs for subsequent bloodmeals. Transmission of the virus to naive pigs by infective bites failed in all attempts. The volume of blood contained within the closed mouthparts of the stable fly seems to be insufficient to deliver an infective dose of the virus. Stable flies are unlikely to transmit PRRSV from one pig to another while blood feeding. The fate of the virus after a bloodmeal remains to be determined.","Rochon, K; Baker, R B; Almond, G W; Watson, D W",Journal of medical entomology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21845948/,455

Single-dose vaccination with NDV-FLS significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lungs, but only mildly decreased lung inflammation. NDV-Δ19S-treated hamsters had a moderate decrease in SARS-CoV-2 titers in lungs and presented with severe microscopic lesions, suggesting that truncation of the spike protein was a less effective strategy. In summary, NDV-vectored vaccines represent a viable option for protection against COVID-19.

208912,Early Stress Detection and Analysis using EEG signals in Machine Learning Framework,2021,"In the era of advanced mobile technology, freedom of expression over social media has become prevalent among online users. This generates a huge amount of communication that eventually forms a ground for extensive research and analysis. The social network analysis allows identifying the influential people in society over microblogging platforms. Twitter, being an evolving social media platform, has become increasingly vital for online dialogues, trends, and content virality. Applications of discovering influential users over Twitter are manifold. It includes viral marketing, brand analysis, news dissemination, health awareness spreading, propagating political movement, and opinion leaders for empowering governance. In our research, we have proposed a sustainable approach, namely Weighted Correlated Influence (WCI), which incorporates the relative impact of timeline-based and trend-specific features of online users. Our methodology considers merging the profile activity and underlying network topology to designate online users with an influence score, which represents the combined effect. To quantify the performance of our proposed method, the Twitter trend #CoronavirusPandemic is used. Also, the results are validated for another social media trend. The experimental outcomes depict enhanced performance of proposed WCI over existing methods that are based on precision, recall, and F1-measure for validation.","Jain, Somya; Sinha, Adwitiya",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,455
210797,Opportunities and mitigation strategies for biomaterials: to combat the challenges of COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress and its associated factors among cancer survivors in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous Internet-based study was conducted between 23 April and 26 June 2020. During the study period, the country underwent phase 3 and phase 4 of the Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO). Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-assessment scale for measuring distress (total HADS score; HADS-T) with two subscales, namely, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived threat of infection was measured based on the health belief model. RESULTS: From a total of 631 responses received, the proportion of participants with anxiety and depression symptoms (above threshold score of 8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) was 29.0 and 20.9%, respectively. Psychological distress (HADS-T > 16) was reported in 22.3% of the respondents. A total of 16.5% had combined anxiety and depression symptoms. The highest HADS-A (6.10; 95% CI 5.64-6.56), HADS-D (5.61; 95% CI 5.14-6.08), and HADS-T (11.71; 95% CI 10.84-12.58) scores were reported among respondents during phase 4 of the MCO. Partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that self-perceived health status, perceived susceptibility, and severity of COVID-19 have the greatest effect, leading to higher HADS-A, HADS-D, and HADS-T scores. CONCLUSION: Heightened psychological distress was evident in cancer survivors particularly during the enforcement of the MCO over COVID-19. Providing support to address cancer survivors' psychological and emotional needs during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential.","Wong, Li Ping; Lai, Lee Lee; See, Mee Hoong; Alias, Haridah; Danaee, Mahmoud; Ting, Chuo Yew; Tok, Peter Seah Keng",Support. care cancer,,455

Background: As the pandemic of COVID-19 started to surface the manufacturers went under pressure to address demand challenges. Social distancing measures made fewer people available to work. In such situations, robots were pointed at to support humans to address a shortage in supply. An important activity where humans are needed in a manufacturing value chain is assembly. HRC assembly systems are supposed to safeguard coexisting humans, perform a range of actions, and often need to be reconfigured to handle product variety. This requires them to be resilient and adaptable to various configurations during their operational life. Besides the potential advantages of using robots the challenges of using them in an industrial assembly are enormous. Methods: This mini-review summarizes the challenges of industrial deployment of collaborative robots for assembly applications. Applications: The documented challenges highlight the future research directions in human-robot interaction for industrial applications.","Malik, Ali Ahmad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15975v1.pdf,455

Data regarding its far-reaching impacts are severely lacking, thereby hindering the development of evidence-based strategies to mitigate its direct and indirect health consequences. To address this need, the Africa Research, Implementation Science, and Education (ARISE) Network established a mobile survey platform in SSA to generate longitudinal data regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19 prevention and management and to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on health and socioeconomic domains. We conducted a baseline survey of 900 healthcare workers, 1,795 adolescents 10 to 19 years of age, and 1,797 adults 20 years or older at six urban and rural sites in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Households were selected using sampling frames of existing Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems or national surveys when possible. Healthcare providers in urban areas were sampled using lists from professional associations. Data were collected through computer-assisted telephone interviews from July to November 2020. Consenting participants responded to surveys assessing KAP and the impact of the pandemic on nutrition, food security, healthcare access and utilization, lifestyle, and mental health. We found that mobile telephone surveys can be a rapid and reliable strategy for data collection during emergencies, but challenges exist with response rates. Maintaining accurate databases of telephone numbers and conducting brief baseline in-person visits can improve response rates. The challenges and lessons learned from this effort can inform future survey efforts during COVID-19 and other emergencies, as well as remote data collection in SSA in general.","Hemler, Elena C; Korte, Michelle L; Lankoande, Bruno; Millogo, Ourohiré; Assefa, Nega; Chukwu, Angela; Workneh, Firehiwot; Tinkasimile, Amani; Lyatuu, Isaac; Soura, Abdramane; Wang, Dongqing; Madzorera, Isabel; Vuai, Said; Bärnighausen, Till; Sando, Mary Mwanyika; Killewo, Japhet; Oduola, Ayoade; Sie, Ali; Berhane, Yemane; Fawzi, Wafaie W",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,455

Epilepsy is the most common neurological disease in childhood and adolescence. The aim of this study was to determine anxiety levels among the mothers of children under follow-up for epilepsy in our clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study group consisted of the mothers of epilepsy patients who were under follow-up in the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic of the tertiary care center and were scheduled for a routine examination during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mothers' anxiety levels according to the Beck Anxiety Inventory and their opinions about COVID-19 in relation to their child were assessed and compared based on whether the mother/patient attended their appointments in person and whether the child had frequent or infrequent seizures. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety level between the mothers of 64 children with epilepsy who attended their appointment during the pandemic and those of the mothers of 52 who did not attend their appointment. However, the mothers of children with frequent seizures had significantly higher anxiety levels. CONCLUSION: Anxiety level of mothers whose children have frequent seizures was significantly higher compared to mothers whose children have infrequent seizures. It is important to be aware about this point and using telemedicine approach in suitable population and postpone routine outpatient follow-up appointments as much as possible.","Celik, Halil; Acikel, Sadettin Burak; Ozdemir, Fatih Mehmet Akif; Aksoy, Erhan; Oztoprak, Ulkuhan; Cucu, Ergin; Kucur, Ozge; Ceylan, Nesrin; Yuksel, Deniz",Eur Neurol,,455

The flexibility of KG modeling is both a blessing and a challenge from the learning point of view. In this paper we propose a novel coupled tensor-matrix framework for KG embedding. We leverage tensor factorization tools to learn concise representations of entities and relations in knowledge bases and employ these representations to perform drug repurposing for COVID-19.

271153,Impfen gegen Covid-19,2021,"MRI-guided radiation treatment planning is widely applied because of its superior soft-tissue contrast and no ionization radiation compared to CT-based planning. In this regard, synthetic CT (sCT) images should be generated from the patients MRI scans if radiation treatment planning is sought. Among the different available methods for this purpose, the deep learning algorithms have and do outperform their conventional counterparts. In this study, we investigated the performance of some most popular deep learning architectures including eCNN, U-Net, GAN, V-Net, and Res-Net for the task of sCT generation. As a baseline, an atlas-based method is implemented to which the results of the deep learning-based model are compared. A dataset consisting of 20 co-registered MR-CT pairs of the male pelvis is applied to assess the different sCT production methods' performance. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics were computed between the estimated sCT and the ground truth (reference) CT images. The visual inspection revealed that the sCTs produced by eCNN, V-Net, and ResNet, unlike the other methods, were less noisy and greatly resemble the ground truth CT image. In the whole pelvis region, the eCNN yielded the lowest MAE (26.03-8.85 HU) and ME (0.82-7.06 HU), and the highest PCC metrics were yielded by the eCNN (0.93-0.05) and ResNet (0.91-0.02) methods. The ResNet model had the highest PSNR of 29.38-1.75 among all models. In terms of the Dice similarity coefficient, the eCNN method revealed superior performance in major tissue identification (air, bone, and soft tissue). All in all, the eCNN and ResNet deep learning methods revealed acceptable performance with clinically tolerable quantification errors.","Bahrami, Abbas; Karimian, Alireza; Arabi, Hossein",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06315v1.pdf,455
273975,"Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",2020,"Family visiting restrictions in nursing homes due to COVID-19-related measures have a major impact on elderly and their families. As an alternative communication means, TNO is developing an augmented reality (AR)-based solution to realize high-quality virtual social contact. To investigate its suitability for remote family visits in nursing homes, the AR-based solution will be compared to regular video calling in a user study involving elderly and their family members. Based on focus groups with elderly, family and caretakers, user experience (UX) indicators have been established to evaluate these virtual family visits, of which social presence was the most prominent. Remote family visits via AR-based and regular video calling are expected to result in different UX. It is hypothesized that participants will report the highest levels of social presence in the AR condition. If AR-based video calling is indeed preferred, TNO will continue and upscale the development of this technology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Abels, E.; Toet, A.; van der Weerden, A.; Smeets, B.; Klunder, T.; Stokking, H.","4th International Conference on Human Interaction and Emerging Technologies: Future Applications, IHIET – AI 2021",,455

277026,Sustainable soil use and management: An interdisciplinary and systematic approach,2020,"Meteorological conditions may influence the incidence of many infectious diseases. Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, air-borne, emerging, viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic affected more than 210 countries and territories worldwide including Saudi Arabia. There are contradictory research papers about the correlation between meteorological parameters and incidence of COVID-19 in some countries worldwide. The current study investigates the impact of outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions on the daily recorded COVID-19 cases in western region (Makkah and Madinah cities) of Saudi Arabia over a period of 8 months from March to October 2020. Reports of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from the webpage of Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) were used. Considering, the incubation period of COVID-19 which ranged from 2 to 14 days, the relationships between daily COVID-19 cases and outdoor meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) using a lag time of 10 days are investigated. The results showed that the highest daily COVID-19 cases in Makkah and Madinah were reported during the hottest months of the year (April-July 2020) when outdoor temperature ranged from 26.51 to 40.71 °C in Makkah and of 23.89-41.20 °C in Madinah, respectively. Partial negative correlation was detected between outdoor relative humidity and daily recorded COVID-19 cases. No obvious correlation could be demonstrated between wind speed and daily COVID-19 cases. This indicated that most of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in the cool, air-conditioned, dry, and bad-ventilated indoor environment in the investigated cities. These results will help the epidemiologists to understand the correlation between both outdoor and indoor meteorological conditions and SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. These findings would be also a useful supplement to assist the local healthcare policymakers to implement and apply a specific preventive measures and education programs for controlling of COVID-19 transmission.","Habeebullah, Turki M; Abd El-Rahim, Ibrahim H A; Morsy, Essam A",J Environ Manage,,455
280044,"Imprints of pandemic lockdown on subsurface water quality in the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin, South India: A revival perspective",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the prognostic value of 3 severity scales: the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score, and the Severity Community-Acquired Pneumonia (SCAP) score. To build a new predictive model for in-hospital mortality in patients over the age of 75 years admitted with pneumonia due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients older than 75 years admitted from the emergency department for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 12 and April 27, 2020. We recorded demographic (age, sex, living in a care facility or not), clinical (symptoms, comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), and analytical (serum biochemistry, blood gases, blood count, and coagulation factors) variables. A risk model was constructed, and the ability of the 3 scales to predict all-cause in-hospital mortality was compared. RESULTS: We included 186 patients with a median age of 85 years (interquartile range, 80-89 years);44.1% were men. Mortality was 47.3%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were as follows for each tool: PSI, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82);CURB-65 score, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62-0.79);and SCAP score, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81). Risk factors included in the model were the presence or absence of symptoms (cough, dyspnea), the CCI, and analytical findings (aspartate aminotransferase, potassium, urea, and lactate dehydrogenase. The AUC for the model was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88). CONCLUSION: This study shows that the predictive power of the PSI for mortality is moderate and perceptibly higher than the CURB-65 and SCAP scores. We propose a new predictive model for mortality that offers significantly better performance than any of the 3 scales compared. However, our model must undergo external validation.","Lopez-Izquierdo, R.; Ruiz Albi, T.; Bermejo-Martin, J. F.; Almansa, R.; Villafane Sanz, F. V.; Arroyo Olmedo, L.; Urbina Carrera, C.

283246,Line tracking control of royal Thai air force nursing mobile robot using visual feedback,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To determine SARS-CoV-2-antibody prevalence in pediatric healthcare workers (pHCWs). DESIGN: Baseline prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG was assessed in a prospective cohort study from a large pediatric healthcare facility. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and anxiety level about COVID-19 were determined. Prevalence difference between emergency department (ED)-based and non-ED-pHCWs was modeled controlling for those covariates. Chi-square test-for-trend was used to examine prevalence by month of enrollment. RESULTS: Most of 642 pHCWs enrolled were 31-40years, female and had no comorbidities. Half had children in their home, 49% had traveled, 42% reported an illness since January, 31% had a known COVID-19 exposure, and 8% had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. High COVID-19 pandemic anxiety was reported by 71%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was 4.1%; 8.4% among ED versus 2.0% among non-ED pHCWs (p < 0.001). ED-work location and known COVID-19 exposure were independent risk factors. 31% of antibody-positive pHCWs reported no symptoms. Prevalence significantly (p < 0.001) increased from 3.0% in April-June to 12.7% in July-August. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was low in pHCWs but increased rapidly over time. Both working in the ED and exposure to a COVID-19-positive contact were associated with antibody-seropositivity. Ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential. These data may guide vaccination policies to protect front-line workers.","Morris, Claudia R; Sullivan, Patrick; Mantus, Grace; Sanchez, Travis; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Hanberry, Bradley; Iyer, Srikant; Heilman, Stacy; Camacho-Gonzalez, Andres; Figueroa, Janet; Manoranjithan, Shaminy; Leake, Deborah; Mendis, Reshika; Cleeton, Rebecca; Chen, Christie; Krieger, Rachel; Bush, Patricia; Hughes, Tiffany; Little, Wendalyn K; Suthar, Mehul S; Wrammert, Jens; Vos, Miriam B",Int J Infect Dis,,455

The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. RESULTS: In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83-28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41-28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers should be provided with resources to minimize this risk.","Sahebi, Ali; Nejati-Zarnaqi, Bayram; Moayedi, Siamak; Yousefi, Kosar; Torres, Mercedes; Golitaleb, Mohamad",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,455

Methods: We conducted a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort study at 4 public hospitals in Singapore. Patients with COVID-19 were monitored for a median of 6 months after recovery from acute infection. Clinical symptoms and radiologic data were collected, along with plasma samples for quantification of immune mediators. The relationship between clinical symptoms and immune cytokine profiles was investigated. Results: Two hundred eighty-eight participants were recruited, and follow-up data were available for 183, 175, and 120 participants at days 30, 90, and 180 postsymptom onset, respectively. Symptoms related to COVID-19 were present in 31 (16.9%), 13 (7.4%), and 14 (11.7%) at days 30, 90, and 180. In a multivariable model, age &gt;65 years, non-Chinese ethnicity, and the severity of acute infection were associated with increased likelihood of persistent symptoms. Recovered COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-17A, stem cell factor, IL-12p70, and IL-1beta and pro-angiogenic macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor at day 180 compared with healthy controls. Higher levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and platelet-derived growth factor-BB were detected in patients with persistent symptoms, versus symptom-free patients. Conclusions: Approximately 10% of recovered patients had persistent symptoms 6 months after initial infection. Immune cytokine signatures of the recovered patients reflected ongoing chronic inflammation and angiogenesis.

Doravirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of islatravir and doravirine coadministration in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, fixed-sequence study. METHODS: Adult participants without HIV infection were administered oral doravirine 100 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 4) once daily (QD) for 5 days, immediately followed by oral islatravir 2.25 mg (n = 10) or placebo QD (n = 4) for 14 days; islatravir 2.25 mg and doravirine 100 mg QD, or placebo QD, were then coadministered for 5 days. Pharmacokinetic and safety data were collected. RESULTS: Doravirine geometric least-squares mean ratios (90% confidence intervals (CIs)) of (doravirine + islatravir)/doravirine for the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over 24 h (AUC0-24h), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and plasma concentration at 24 h post-dose (C24h) were not meaningfully impacted. Islatravir geometric least-squares mean ratios (90% CI) of (islatravir + doravirine)/islatravir for AUC0-24h and Cmax were both close to unity, 1.06 (1.01, 1.12) and 1.08 (0.91, 1.27), respectively. All study regimens were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that coadministration of islatravir and doravirine had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug, and support further clinical investigation of islatravir in combination with doravirine for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.","Matthews, Randolph P; Jackson Rudd, Deanne; Fillgrove, Kerry L; Zhang, Saijuan; Tomek, Charles; Stoch, S Aubrey; Iwamoto, Marian",Clin. drug investg,,455

The concurrent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 must not distract us from appreciating the fact that this Law will comprehensively overhaul the health regulatory framework of the world's most populous country during the coming decade, if not beyond. This article offers an original evaluation of the Law in its political context. The Law commendably promises to safeguard the right to health, assist citizens to live a 'complete cycle of life', and promote health using the resources of the public health system. However, it is also deeply politicised, guaranteeing extensive and penetrative political control in health campaigns, digitalised health data, the governance of health institutions, and the resolution of medical disputes. This can be explained by the consequential roles played by epidemics in China's historical dynastic cycles, but even more so by powerful tendencies of centralisation on the part of the Leninist Party-state. The Law's potential is thus subject to the overriding caveat that the Party-state's existence and influence over law and public health must be secured.","Ip, Eric C",Med. law rev,,455

315952,Containment measures limit environmental effects on COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics,2021,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2, either in its natural reservoir or in the human population, is still unclear, but this knowledge is essential for effective prevention and control. We propose a new framework to systematically identify recombination events, excluding those due to noise and convergent evolution. We found that several recombination events occurred for SARS-CoV-2 before its transfer to humans, including a more recent recombination event in the receptor-binding domain. We also constructed a probabilistic mutation network to explore the diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 after human infection. Clustering results show that the novel coronavirus has diverged into several clusters that cocirculate over time in various regions and that several mutations across the genome are fixed during transmission throughout the human population, including D614G in the S gene and two accompanied mutations in ORF1ab. Together, these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 experienced a complicated evolution process in the natural environment and point to its continuous adaptation to humans. The new framework proposed in this study can help our understanding of and response to other emerging pathogens.","Wang, Yinghan; Zeng, Jinfeng; Zhang, Chi; Chen, Cai; Qiu, Zekai; Pang, Jiali; Xu, Yutian; Dong, Zhiqi; Song, Yanxin; Liu, Weiying; Dong, Peipei; Sun, Litao; Chen, Yao-Qing; Shu, Yuelong; Du, Xiangjun",Brief. bioinform,,455
316458,Training Residents During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Given the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, identification of immunogenic targets against the viral protein will provide crucial advances towards the development of sensitive diagnostic tools and vaccination strategies. Our previous study has found that ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly immunogenic and shows high sensitivity in identifying COVID-19 disease. In this study, by employing overlapping linear peptides, we characterized the IgG immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein that are seropositive in the sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The major immunogenic epitopes are localised at 1) N- termini alpha helix, 2) the resides spanning beta 2 and 3 sheets, and 3) the loop between beta 4 and 5 sheets. Additionally, hamster model infected by SARS-CoV-2 further validate the seropositivity of the linear epitopes in-vivo, demonstrating a potential application of the linear peptide-based immunization strategy. Taken together, identification and validation of these B-cell linear epitopes will provide insights towards the design of serological diagnostics and peptide-based vaccination approach against this pandemic virus of high priority.","Wang, Xiaohui; Lam, Joy-Yan; Chen, Linlei; Au, Shannon Wing-Ngor; To, Kelvin K W; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kok, Kin-Hang",Emerg Microbes Infect,,455

This study was aimed to describe the clinicoepidemological features and the causes of mortality of COVID-19 deceased patients admitted in a dedicated COVID center in India. Methodology: This was a retrospective study done in adult deceased patients admitted in COVID ICU from April 4 to July 24, 2020. The clinical features, comorbidities, complications, and causes of mortality in these patients were analyzed. Pediatric deceased were analyzed separately. Results: A total of 654 adult patients were admitted in the ICU during the study period and ICU mortality was 37.7% (247/654). Among the adult deceased, 65.9% were males with a median age of 56 years [interquartile range (IQR), 41.5-65] and 94.74% had one or more comorbidities, most common being hypertension (43.3%), diabetes mellitus (34.8%), and chronic kidney disease (20.6%).The most common presenting features in these deceased were fever (75.7%), cough (68.8%), and shortness of breath (67.6%). The mean initial sequential organ failure assessment score was 9.3 +/- 4.7 and 24.2% were already intubated at the time of admission. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (IQR, 3-11). The most common cause of death was sepsis with multiorgan failure (55.1%) followed by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (25.5%). All pediatric deceased had comorbid conditions and the most common cause of death in this group was severe ARDS. Conclusion: In this cohort of adult deceased, most were young males with age less than 65 years with one or more comorbidities, hypertension being the most common. Only 5% of the deceased had no comorbidities. Sepsis with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome was the commonest cause of death.","Aggarwal, R.; Bhatia, R.; Kulshrestha, K.; Soni, K.

Scientists are forced to develop vaccine and effective drugs to control COVID-19 infection. To develop effective vaccine for SARS - COVID 19, immunoinformatics and computational approaches could helps to design successful vaccine against this biggest danger for humanity. Here we used various in - silico approaches to designed vaccine against COVID-19. To develop vaccine, we target S- protein, expressed on the virus surface plays important role in COVID-19 infection. We identified 12 B-cell, 9 T-helper and 20 Cytotoxic T-cell epitope based on criteria of selection. The predicted epitopes were link simultaneously with GPGPG & AAY linkers. The ß-defensin was used as adjuvant, linked with selected epitope by using EAAAK linker. For vaccine construct justification we analysed its immunogenicity, allergenicity and physiochemical properties. Our study revealed that vaccine was non toxic, immunogenic and antigenic in nature and covers 98.6% of world population, important for vaccine effectively. In- silico cloning was used to analyse its expression in vector. Molecular docking was performed to study the interaction of construct with TLR (TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9) molecules. The immune simulation was conducted and conformed that our vaccine constructs can induces both acquired and humoral immunity effectively against COVID-19 at very low concentration, but along with bioinformatics study we need to conduct experiment in laboratory to validate its safety and effectiveness.","Singh, Hitesh; Jakhar, Renu; Sehrawat, Neelam",Heliyon,,455

331030,"No ""Quick Fix"" for This: An Update on the Brazilian Butt Lift",2020,"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic-related social restrictions on clinical course of patients treated for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unclear. In the present study presentation and outcome of patients with STEMI in the year 2020 were compared with the years before in a German registry that includes all patients hospitalized for acute STEMI in a region with approximately 1 million inhabitants. In the year 2020 726 patients with STEMI were registered compared with 10.226 patients in the years 2006 to 2019 (730 ± 57 patients per year). No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding age, gender and medical history of patients. However, in the year 2020 a significantly higher rate of patients admitted with cardiogenic shock (21.9% vs 14.2%, p <0.01) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) (14.3% vs 11.1%, p <0.01) was observed. The rate of patients with subacute myocardial infarction (14.3% vs 11.6%, p <0.05) was elevated in 2020. Hospital mortality increased by 52% from the years 2006 to 2019 (8.4%) to the year 2020 (12.8%, p <0.01). Only 4 patients (0.6%) with STEMI in the year 2020 had SARS-CoV-2 infection, none of those died in-hospital. In conclusion, in the year 2020 a highly significant increase of STEMI-patients admitted to hospital with advanced infarction and poor prognosis was observed. As the structure of the emergency network to treat patients with STEMI was unchanged during the study period, the most obvious reason for these changes was COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown and the fear of many people to contact medical staff during the pandemic.","Wienbergen, Harm; Retzlaff, Tina; Schmucker, Johannes; Marin, Luis Alberto Mata; Rühle, Stephan; Garstka, Daniela; Osteresch, Rico; Fach, Andreas; Hambrecht, Rainer",Am J Cardiol,,455

METHODS: A prospective, observational, non-randomized cohort trial was performed comparing 25 consecutive patients who underwent PUG placement between April 2020 and August 2020 with 25 consecutive patients who underwent PRG placement between February 2020 and March 2020. Procedure time, sedation, analgesia requirements, and complications were compared between the two groups in non-inferiority analysis. RESULTS: Technical success rates were 96% in both groups (24/25) of procedures. Ninety-two percent of patients in the PUG cohort were admitted to the ICU at the time of G-tube request. Aside from significantly more COVID-19 patients in the PUG group (P < .001), there was no other statistically significant difference in patient demographics. Intra-procedure pain medication requirements were the same for both groups, 50 micrograms of IV fentanyl (P = 1.0). Intra-procedure sedation with IV midazolam was insignificantly higher in the PUG group 1.12 mg vs 0.8 mg (P = .355). Procedure time trended toward statistical significance (P = .076), with PRG being shorter than PUG (30.5 ± 14.1 minutes vs 39.7 ± 17.9 minutes). There were 2 non-device related major complications in the PUG group and 1 major and 1 minor complication in the PRG group. CONCLUSION: PUG is similar in terms of complications to PRG gastrostomy tube placement and a safe method for gastrostomy tube placement in the critically ill with the added benefits of bedside placement, elimination of radiation exposure, and expanded and improved access to care.","Reis, Stephen P; Brejt, Sidney Z; Weintraub, Joseph R; Ahmad, Noor; Susman, Jonathan; Mobley, David G",J Intensive Care Med,,455

All tested individuals were judged in advance by public health centers for the necessity of undergoing the test with possible contact history and/or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. In this study, to identify the predictors of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for more efficient and evidenced selection of suspected individuals, we enrolled 3,540 consecutive individuals, tested in the first 7 months of the testing program, with data regarding to the history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, including those involved in cluster outbreaks. This cohort included 284 foreign students (257 males and 27 females) from a vocational school involved in the largest cluster outbreak in the area. Close contact history was present in 952 (26.9%) of the participants. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results showed that 164 participants (4.6%) were positive and 3,376 participants (95.4%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene (N2). In the univariate and multivariate analyses, history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, higher age, cough symptoms, and non-native ethnicity were predictors for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. However, the significance of age and foreign nationality disappeared or declined upon excluding the foreign students from the aforementioned largest cluster outbreak. In conclusion, a history of close contact with COVID-19 patients and the presence of cough symptoms are significant predictors of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity.","Ishii, Tadashi; Kushimoto, Shigeki; Katori, Yukio; Kure, Shigeo; Igarashi, Kaoru; Fujita, Motoo; Takayama, Shin; Abe, Michiaki; Tanaka, Junichi; Kikuchi, Akiko; Abe, Yoshiko; Imai, Hiroyuki; Inaba, Yohei; Iwamatsu-Kobayashi, Yoko; Nishioka, Takashi; Onodera, Ko; Akaishi, Tetsuya",Tohoku J Exp Med,,455

This goal has been achieved to verify by extracting the time evolution of the doubling time Td(t). The results provide a quantitative measure and make possible predictions on the time evolution of epidemic for different containment policy. Where the lowest s factor, the characteristic time of the exponential growing Td(t) in the arrested regime, was reached by LFT policy also the lowest number of deaths and the shorter time width of the epidemic dome was reached. The record for the largest number of deaths is correlated with the largest s factor in the near threshold regime where no containment measures were taken in time. LFT policy has been able to reduce both the intensity and time width of the Covid-19 pandemic dome achieving both a low number of deaths and low economic losses","Bianconi, Antonio; Marcelli, Augusto; Campi, Gaetano; Perali, Andrea",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04604v2.pdf,455

It happened with Tuberculosis (TB) and is happening with COVID-19. Due to its dynamic nature, this group of diseases must be studied in the context of the social determinants of health. Aim: To describe the epidemiological behavior of COVID-19 in response to the control strategies implemented by the Chilean Ministry of Health and its similarities with the socio-economic distribution of TB in the Metropolitan Region (MR) of Chile. Material and Methods: The 2018 Tuberculosis rates and average income of districts belonging to the MR were described, as well as the incidence rates of COVID-19. A Pearson correlation analysis was applied between the rates of both diseases, to assess similarities in the epidemiological distribution patterns. Results: The RM accounts for over 50% of the total national cases of COVID-19. After the implementation of selective quarantines, only four districts in the RM managed to control the outbreak (those with the highest incomes). In the rest, a clear increase in cases was observed. The districts with the highest increase in cases were the most disadvantaged, and those with the highest TB rates during 2018, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6. Conclusions: Control policies cannot deepen health inequalities. If vulnerable groups, as well as the factors that determine their health, are not properly identified, the consequences of the current pandemic could be even more devastating.","Olmos, Claudio; Stuardo, Valeria",Rev. méd.

This study analyzed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the volume, disease patterns, and accessibility to essential investigations of patients with suspected cancer referred by the ED to this unit. METHODS: Trends in referrals were analyzed from January 1 to July 8, 2020 and the corresponding dates of 2019. Only non-Covid-19 conditions were evaluated. Three time-based cohorts were defined: prepandemic (January 1-February 19), pandemic (February 19-April 22), and postpandemic (April 22-July 8). Along with descriptive statistics, linear regression was used to test for time trends with weekly referrals as the dependent variable. RESULTS: There were 384, 193, and 450 patients referred during the prepandemic, pandemic, and postpandemic periods, respectively. Following an increasing rate, referrals decreased to unprecedented levels in the pandemic period (average weekly slope: -2.1 cases), then increasing again until near normalization. Waiting times to most diagnostic procedures including radiology, endoscopic, nuclear medicine, and biopsy/cytology during the pandemic period were significantly delayed and time-to-diagnosis was considerably longer (19.72 ± 10.37 days vs. 8.33 ± 3.94 days in prepandemic and 13.49 ± 6.45 days in postpandemic period; P < 0.001 in both). Compared to other cohorts, pandemic cohort patients were more likely to have unintentional weight loss and fever of unknown origin as referral indications while anemia and lymphadenopathy were less common. Patients from the pandemic cohort had a significantly lower rate of malignancies and higher of benign gastrointestinal disorders (40.93% vs. 19.53% and 20.89% in prepandemic and postpandemic periods, respectively; P < 0.001 in both), most notably irritable bowel disease, and of mental and behavioral disorders (15.54% vs. 3.39% and 6.00% in prepandemic and postpandemic periods, respectively; P < 0.001 in both). CONCLUSIONS: As our hospital switched its traditional care to one focused on Covid-19 patients, recognized indicators of healthcare quality of quick diagnosis units were severely disrupted.

Brazil concentrates now the largest number of cases in the continent and, as the disease speedily progressed throughout the country, prompt and challenging operational strategies had to be taken by institutions caring for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in order to assure optimal workflows, triage, and management. Although hospitals in the USA, Europe and Asia have shared their experience on this subject, little has been discussed about such strategies in South America or by the perspective of outpatient centers, which are paramount in the radiology field. This article shares the guidelines adopted early in the pandemic by a nationwide outpatient healthcare center composed by a network of more than 200 patient service centers and nearly 2,000 radiologists in Brazil, discussing operational and patient management strategies, staff protection, changes adopted in the fellowship program, and the effectiveness of such measures.","Torres, Ulysses S; Kerbauy, Daniella M B; Barrancos, Janaína T G; D039,; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Lázari, Carolina S; Granato, Celso Francisco H; Rizzatti, Edgar Gil; Meirelles, Gustavo S P",Medicine (Baltimore),,455

394764,A Statistical Analysis On Covid-2019 To Distinguish Between Myths And Facts With Data Visualization,2021,"OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Sleep is critical to recovery, but inpatient sleep is often disrupted. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing efforts to minimize spread may have improved hospitalized children's sleep by decreasing unnecessary overnight disruptions. This study aimed to describe the impact of these efforts on pediatric inpatient sleep using objective and subjective metrics. METHODS: Sleep disruptions for pediatric inpatients admitted prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared. Hand hygiene sensors tracking room entries were utilized to measure objective overnight disruptions for 69 nights pre-pandemic and 154 pandemic nights. Caregiver surveys of overnight disruptions, sleep quantity, and caregiver mood were adopted from validated tools: the Karolinska Sleep Log, Potential Hospital Sleep Disruptions and Noises Questionnaire, and Visual Analog Mood Scale. RESULTS: Nighttime room entries initially decreased 36% (95% CI: 30%, 42%, p < 0.001), then returned towards baseline, mirroring the COVID-19 hospital census. However, surveyed caregivers (n_pre = 293, n_post = 154) reported more disrupted sleep (p < 0.001) due to tests (21% vs. 38%), anxiety (23% vs. 41%), and pain (23% vs. 48%). Caregivers also reported children slept 61 fewer minutes (95% CI: -12 min, -110 min, p < 0.001). Caregivers self-reported feeling more sad, weary, and worse overall (p < 0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decrease in objective room entries during the pandemic, caregivers reported their children were disrupted more and slept less. Caregivers also self-reported worse mood. This highlights the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on subjective experiences of hospitalized children and their caregivers. Future work targeting stress and anxiety could improve pediatric inpatient sleep.","Riehm, Joseph M; Arora, Vineet M; Tatineni, Swetha; Erondu, Amarachi; Mozer, Christine L; Cook, David J; Byron, Maxx; Mordell, Lisa; Ye, Fanheng; Orlov, Nicola M",Sleep Med,,455

OBJECTIVES: To generate deep, mid-interventricular septal (IVS) lesions using high-intensity ultrasound (US) from an endocardial catheter-based approach. METHODS: Irrigated US catheters (12 Fr) were fabricated with 3x5 mm transducers of 5.0, 6.5 and 8.0 MHz frequencies, and compared in an ex vivo perfused myocardial ablation model. In vivo septal ablation in swine (n=12) was performed via femoral venous access to the right ventricle. Lesions were characterized by echocardiography, cardiac MRI and electroanatomic voltage mapping pre- and post-ablation, and at 30 days. Four animals were euthanized immediately post-ablation to compare acute and chronic lesion histology and gross pathology. RESULTS: In ex vivo models, maximal lesion depth and volume was achieved by 6.5 MHz catheters, which were used in vivo. Lesion depth by gross pathology was similar post-ablation (10.8[95% CI:9.9,12.4] mm) and at 30 days (11.2[CI:10.6,12.4] mm, p=0.56). Lesion volume decreased post-ablation to 30 days (255[CI:198,440] to 162[CI:133,234] mm3 p=0.05), yet transmurality increased 58%(CI:50,76) to 81%(CI:74,93), attributable to a reduction in IVS thickness (16.0±1.7 to 10.6±2.4 mm, p=0.007). MRI confirmed dense septal ablation by delayed enhancement, with increased T1 time post-ablation and at 30 days, and increased T2 time only post-ablation. Voltage mapping of both sides of IVS demonstrated reduced unipolar (but not bipolar) voltage along the IVS. CONCLUSIONS: High-intensity US catheter ablation may be an effective treatment for mid-myocardial or epicardial VAs from an endocardial approach.","Nazer, Babak; Giraud, David; Zhao, Yan; Hodovan, James; Elman, Miriam R; Masri, Ahmad; Gerstenfeld, Edward P; Lindner, Jonathan R",Heart rhythm,,455

Diagnostic radiographers in Gauteng providing chest CT, chest radiograph and MRI services are frontline workers experiencing these unprecedented times. Therefore, this study undertook to explore diagnostic radiographers' experiences of COVID-19. METHODS: A qualitative approach using an asynchronous opened-ended online questionnaire was used to explore diagnostic radiographers' experiences of COVID-19. Responses from purposively sampled diagnostic radiographers in Gauteng SA, underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Sixty diagnostic radiographers representing both the private and public health sector responded to the questionnaire. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: new work flow and operations, effect on radiographer well-being and radiographer resilience. CONCLUSION: Besides experiencing a shift in their professional work routine and home/family dynamics, diagnostic radiographers' well-being has also been impacted by COVID-19. Adapting to the ""new way of work"" has been challenging yet their resilience and dedication to their profession, providing quality patient care and skill expertise is their arsenal to combat these challenges. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on diagnostic radiographers will allow radiology departments' management, hospital management, professional bodies and educational institutions to re-evaluate provision of resources, training, employee wellness programs as well as policies and procedures.","Lewis, S; Mulla, F",,,455

By copolymerizing N-acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) with methacrylic acid (MAA) in the presence of a crosslinker, poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide-co-methacrylic acid) [P(NAGA-MAA)] copolymer microgels with an MAA molar fraction of 10-70 mol % were obtained. The polymerization kinetics suggests that the copolymer microgels have a random structure. The size of the microgels was between 60 and 120 nm in the non-aggregated swollen state in aqueous medium and depending on the solvent conditions, they show reversible swelling and shrinking upon temperature change. Their phase transition behavior was studied by a combination of methods to understand the process of the UCST-type behavior and interactions between NAGA and MAA. P(NAGA-MAA) microgels were loaded with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by the reduction of AgNO3 under UV light. Compared with the chemical reduction of AgNO3, the photoreduction results in smaller AgNPs and the amount and size of the AgNPs are dependent on the comonomer ratio. The catalytic activity of the AgNP-loaded microgels in 4-nitrophenol reduction was tested.","Yang, Dong; Eronen, Heli; Tenhu, Heikki; Hietala, Sami",Langmuir,,455

407467,Fiskalpolitik in der Corona-Krise: Wie viel ist zu viel?,2021,"Crowds are a source of transmission in the COVID-19 spread. Contention and mitigation measures have focused on reducing people's mass gathering. Such efforts have led to a drop in the economy. The application of a vaccine at a world level represents a grand challenge for humanity, and it is not likely to accomplish even within months. In the meantime, we still need tools to allow the people integration into their regular routines reducing the risk of infection. In this context, this paper presents a solution for crowd management. The aim is to monitor and manage crowd levels in interior places or point-of-interests (POI), particularly shopping centers or stores. The solution is based on a POI recommendation system that suggests the nearest safe options upon request of a particular POI to visit by the user. In this sense, it recommends places near the user location with the least estimated crowd. The recommendation algorithm uses a top-K approach and behavioral game theory to predict the user's choice and estimate the crowd level for the requested POI. To evaluate the efficiency of this technological intervention in terms of the potential number of contacts of possible COVID-19 infections and the recommendation quality, we have developed an agent-based model (ABM). The adoption level of new technologies can be related to the end-user experience and trust in such technologies. As the end-user follows a recommendation that leads to uncrowded places, both the end-user experience and trust increased. We study and model this process using the OCEAN model of personality. The results from the studied scenarios showed that the proposed solution is widely adopted by the agents, as the trust factor increased from 0.5 (initial set value) to 0.76. In terms of crowd level, these are effectively managed and reduced on average by 40%. The mobility contacts were reduced by 40%, decreasing the risk of COVID-19 infection. An APP has been designed to support the described crowd management and contact tracing functionality.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether older adults reported cancellation or avoidance of medical care during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore associations with health and socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 880 older adults aged &#8805; 62 years (mean age 73.4 years, 50.3% female) were used from the COVID-19 questionnaire of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a cohort study among community-dwelling older adults in the Netherlands. Cancellation and avoidance of care were assessed by self-report, and covered questions on cancellation of primary care (general practitioner), cancellation of hospital outpatient care, and postponed help-seeking. Respondent characteristics included age, sex, educational level, loneliness, depression, anxiety, frailty, multimorbidity and information on quarantine. RESULTS: 35% of the sample reported cancellations due to the COVID-19 situation, either initiated by the respondent (12%) or by healthcare professionals (29%). Postponed help-seeking was reported by 8% of the sample. Multimorbidity was associated with healthcare-initiated cancellations (primary care OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.09-3.50; hospital OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.28-2.74) and respondent-initiated hospital outpatient cancellations (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.04-4.12). Depressive symptoms were associated with postponed help-seeking (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24). CONCLUSION: About one third of the study sample reported cancellation or avoidance of medical care during the first months of the pandemic, and this was more common among those with multiple chronic conditions.

Pulmonary manifestations are predominant and have been well identified. Cardiac involvement is also common. Acute cardiac injury, the most common cardiac manifestation of this disease can be seen in patients even without prior cardiac comorbidities. Established cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease predispose to cardiac injury, the severity of illness and mortality. Non-ischemic myocardial injury secondary to cytokine storm is thought to be the predominant mechanism of acute cardiac injury associated with COVID-19. Multiple mechanisms and processes contribute to cardiac injury resulting in a poor outcome. Some of these are not clearly understood. Clinical and diagnostic details of cardiovascular involvement in these patients are mostly limited to biochemical markers. Multiple therapeutic agents have been tried with questionable efficacy and without clinical evidence. Interactions of comorbidities, cardiovascular drugs, the cardiac effect of therapeutic agents on the illness continue to be under investigation.

METHOD: Online databases were searched on 31 March 2019 in order to identify studies comparing HOMA-IR, serum adiponectin, leptin and resistin levels between patients with SLE and controls. A random-effects model was adopted. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies involving a total of 4460 patients with SLE were included. Patients with SLE had significantly higher HOMA-IR values (standardized mean difference (SMD)=0.425; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.156-0.693; I2=93.8%) than the control group. The serum levels of adiponectin (SMD=0.547; 95% CI 0.219-0.874; I2=90.1%), leptin (SMD=0.843; 95% CI 0.454-1.231; I2=94.4%) and resistin (SMD=0.856; 95% CI 0.199-1.513; I2=96.6%) were all higher among patients with SLE than controls. A meta-regression analysis revealed that the serum resistin level was positively correlated with disease activity (coefficient 0.123; 95% CI 0.051-0.195; p<0.001).

427902,Impact of weather on COVID-19 transmission in south Asian countries: An application of the ARIMAX model,2020,"The vaccine efficacy is a crucial determining factor in choosing a vaccine candidate for human use. When the choices of vaccines are many, the decision-making becomes difficult. General public resorts to the media and news, which talks about efficacies of various vaccines as observed for COVID-19. In this paper, for the first time, a concise mathematical framework for analyzing the efficacy of vaccines is introduced based on the standard definition of vaccine efficacy. The framework is then generalized to incorporate multi-variants. Finally, we introduce the idea of combined efficacy to characterize a vaccine efficacy as obtained from various clinical trials carried out across the world for Covid-19. We show that the efficacy reported by vaccine manufacturers from clinical trial data need not always directly translate to percentage efficacy. The efficacy of a vaccine is inherently a spatio-temporal statistical measure that characterizes a vaccine, which depends on the geographical location, the sample size, and the time of the clinical trials. Here, the dependence of efficacy on spatio-temporal parameters is expounded in detail, using hypothetical clinical trials conducted for different regions at different time intervals using real-world data.","Roy, Durbar; Chakravortty, Dipshikha; Basu, Saptarshi",,,455

Using a survey experiment fielded in the midst of contentious public debate over flying fox management in urban and suburban areas of Australia, we find that stories with characters (i.e., narratives) are more effective than descriptive information at mobilizing support for different forms of bat management, including legal protection, relocation, and habitat restoration. We use conditional process analysis to show that narratives, particularly with accompanying images, are effective because they cause emotional reactions that influence risk perception, which in turn drives public opinion about strategies for risk mitigation. We find that prior attitudes towards bats matter in how narrative messages are received, in particular in how strongly they generate shifts in affective response, risk perception, and public opinion. Our results suggest that those with warm prior attitudes towards bats report greater support for bat dispersal when they perceive impacts from bats to be more likely, while those with cool priors report greater support for bat protection when they perceive impacts from bats to be more positive, revealing 1) potential opportunities for targeted messaging to boost public buy-in of proposals to manage risks associated with human-wildlife interactions, and 2) potential vulnerabilities to disinformation regarding risk.","Guenther, Sara K; Shanahan, Elizabeth A",PLoS One,,455

METHODS: We developed a computational model (transmission and age-stratified clinical and economics outcome model) representing the US population, COVID-19 coronavirus spread (02/2020-12/2022), and vaccination to determine the impact of increasing coverage and expediting time to achieve coverage. RESULTS: When achieving a given vaccination coverage in 270 days (70% vaccine efficacy), every 1% increase in coverage can avert an average of 876,800 (217,000-2,398,000) cases, varying with the number of people already vaccinated. For example, each 1% increase between 40%-50% coverage can prevent 1.5million cases, 56,240 hospitalizations, 6,660 deaths, gain 77,590 QALYs, save $602.8 million in direct medical costs and $1.3 billion in productivity losses . Expediting to 180 days could save an additional 5.8 million cases, 215,790 hospitalizations, 26,370 deaths, 206,520 QALYs, $3.5 billion in direct medical costs, and $4.3 billion in productivity losses. CONCLUSION: Our study quantifies the potential value of decreasing vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccination coverage and how this value may decrease with time it takes to achieve coverage, emphasizing the need to reach high coverage levels as soon as possible, especially before the Fall/Winter.","Bartsch, Sarah M; Wedlock, Patrick T; O039,; Shea, Kelly J; Cox, Sarah N; Strych, Ulrich; Nuzzo, Jennifer B; Ferguson, Marie C; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Siegmund, Sheryl S; Hotez, Peter J; Lee, Bruce Y",J. infect. dis,,455

It evaluates economic resilience by analyzing changes in the amount of credit card payments in the neighborhood and classifying the types of neighborhoods therefrom. The study conducted the ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis, and post hoc tests to analyze the difference in urban characteristics between neighborhood types. Accordingly, three neighborhood types emerged from the analysis: high-resilient neighborhood, low-resilient neighborhood, and neighborhood that benefited from the pandemic. The high-resilient neighborhood is a low-density residential area where many elderly people live. Neighborhoods that benefited are residential areas mainly located in high-density apartments where many families of parents and children live.

In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach.","Rustam, Furqan; Khalid, Madiha; Aslam, Waqar; Rupapara, Vaibhav; Mehmood, Arif; Choi, Gyu Sang",PLoS One,,455

In this study, we explored COVID-19 testing and the impact of the pandemic among participants from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) Cohort, predominantly comprised of low-income minorities living with and without HIV. METHODS: Between July-August, 2020, a telephone survey was administered to 299 MASH participants to assess COVID-19 testing, prevention behaviors, and psychosocial stressors. Healthcare utilization, antiretroviral adherence, food insecurity, and substance use during the pandemic were compared to their last cohort visit (7.8±2.9 months earlier). RESULTS: Half of surveyed participants had been tested for COVID-19, 8 had tested positive, 2 had been hospitalized. PLWH (n=183) were 42% times less likely than uninfected participants to have been tested. However, after adjustment for age, employment, COVID-19 symptoms, mental healthcare, and substance use, the effect of HIV status was no longer significant. PLWH were more likely to have seen a healthcare provider, use face coverings, and avoid public transportation, and less likely to be food insecure and drink hazardously. There were significant changes in substance use patterns during the pandemic as compared to before. CONCLUSION: PLWH, compared to their HIV-uninfected peers, were more likely to engage in preventive measures and healthcare during the pandemic, potentially reducing their exposure to COVID-19. There were no reported changes in antiretroviral adherence or healthcare utilization, but there were changes in substance use; these need to be monitored as this crisis progresses.","Tamargo, Javier A; Martin, Haley R; Diaz-Martinez, Janet; Trepka, Mary Jo; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan; Johnson, Angelique; Mandler, Raul N; Baum, Marianna K",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,455

The current most established quantification method for H2S is HPLC method coupled with fluorescence detection after derivatization with a costly fluorescent reagent, Monobromobimane (MBB). However, The MBB method is characterized by strict reaction condition, long reaction time, tedious operation, and inconsistent reported results. In this study, based on the thiolysis reaction of 7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) ether, the commonly used chromatographic modifier 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3- benzoxadiazole (NBDCl) and four probes (NBDOMe, NBDOEt, NBDOTFE and NBDOCMR) synthesized from NBDCl were tested as alternatives for fast quantification of H2S by LC-MS/MS. The reaction product between NBD ethers/NBDCl and H2S showed special pink color visible to the naked eye and was easy to synthesize and separate in lab; it also showed good retention on common chromatographic columns and high instrument response; therefore it is a good determinand. After establishment of LC-MS/MS methods for all the related compounds, the reaction conditions were optimized for all the probes with H2S. Then the stability, selectivity, reaction rate, sensitivity and quantitative linear relationship between the reaction product and H2S concentration were studied for each probe. Finally, NBDOEt was selected for LC-MS/MS detection of H2S. In comparision with the MBB method, the established NBDOEt method showed matched sensitivity and linearity, better selectivity, and higher repeatability; and had the advantages of easy operation, simple reaction condition, and cheap raw materials. The method was successfully validated and applied to determination of Na2S content in Na2Sâ9H2O bulk drug and injection.

Spraying individuals with disinfectant chemicals is strongly discouraged by various health authorities around the globe because of their propensity for eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm following inhalation, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. This article underscores that the risks associated with the use of these walkthrough gates overweigh any potential benefits. Health authorities must discourage their use and should focus efforts on other preventive measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and hand hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the general public.","Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Khan, Yusra Habib; Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal; Alzarea, Abdulaziz Ibrahim",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,455

516434,Global Pandemics and the Aspiring Plastic Surgery Applicant: Challenges and Potential Solutions,2020,"Rationale: Elevated risk of thrombotic events is a major concern in patients with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). Studies investigating these patients demonstrate high rates of venous and arterial thrombosis. A proposed strategy for prevention of these events involves intensified prophylactic anticoagulation. Retrospective studies have revealed improved outcomes in COVID-19 patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, showing potential benefits of escalated prophylactic dosing. At University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, an anticoagulation guideline for patients with COVID-19 was developed. It stratifies thrombotic risk based on DDimer concentrations, with a threshold for intensifying anticoagulation at 1,000 ng/mL, and further intensification to full anticoagulation at 3,000 ng/mL. This study's purpose was to quantify risks and benefits of this anticoagulation strategy in critically ill patients. Methods: This institution review board approved, single-center, retrospective chart review was performed between March 1, 2020 and July 31, 2020. It included all patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit during their admission. Patients were excluded if they had an indication for therapeutic anticoagulation or an active hemorrhagic event on hospital admission. Primary endpoints included the incidence of thrombotic events and hemorrhagic events. Guideline adherence on initiation of anticoagulation was also assessed. Results: Of the 131 patients screened for inclusion, 101 were included in the final analysis. Baseline characteristics include male gender in 51% of patients and median age of 61. Median baseline D-Dimer was 1,361 ng/mL, with a peak of 4,876 ng/mL. High-flow oxygenation or mechanical ventilation was utilized in 73% of patients, with 21% requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Anticoagulation was initiated in accordance with institutional guidelines in 84% of patients. Thrombotic complications (Table 1) were observed in 24% of patients, with a majority of events involving CRRT circuit thrombosis. Hemorrhagic complications (Table 1) were detected in 12% of patients, with several different bleeding sources observed. Increased rates of both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events were noted in patients requiring mechanical ventilation or CRRT. Conclusions: In critically ill COVID-19 patients managed using an institutional COVID-19 anticoagulation guideline, thrombosis occurred in 24% of patients. This incidence is lower than thrombosis rates in COVID-19 literature, and may be associated with the use of our D-Dimer driven guideline. The hemorrhagic event rate of 12% has limited comparable data in literature at this time. These data provide insight on the use of intensified prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients. Prospective, randomized trials will be useful in determining optimal anticoagulation management in this patient population.","Shuler, E.; Popa, A.; Barcelona, R.; Giddings, O.

DESIGN: Rapid scoping review of publically available published web-literature. SETTING: Five large English speaking countries; United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Australia and New Zealand (NZ). RESULTS: Recruitment and selection to residency programmes in the US, Australia and NZ has been largely unaffected. Canada has implemented video-conferencing in lieu of face-to-face interviews. The UK has relied upon trainee self-assessment for selection. Widespread postponement and cancellation of surgical board examinations was seen across the studied countries. Resident assessment-in-training and certification procedures have been heavily modified. Most didactics have moved online, with some courses and conferences cancelled where this has not been possible. None of the studied countries had a central mandate on resident operating privileges during Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: The collective response by international surgical training bodies to the dual challenges of safeguarding residents whilst minimising disruption to training has been agile and resident centred.

522253,Impact of lockdown on particulate matter concentrations in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"This paper tries to examine how the COVID-19 shock affects different countries through their regional integration and their exposure to Global Value Chains (GVCs). Using input-output tables (EORA 2016), our contribution is threefold. First, building on Pahl et al. (2021), we conceptually revise the approaches to analyse input-output relationships. We underline the difference between the bilateral flow of value added and trade and distinguish between the producers and consumers of value-added. Second, we distinguish between the supply and demand channels through which these countries can be affected by the disruptions in GVCs. Third, we apply this empirical exercise on an understudied region, namely, the Mediterranean region that is characterized by its involvement in several trade agreements that might boost their integration into GVCs. Our main findings show that, first, most of the countries have relatively larger backward GVC linkages than forward ones. Second, in the Northern shore of the Mediterranean, Italy and France are net suppliers of value added since they produce more value-added absorbed abroad than the foreign value-added they consume. Third, our results highlight also the limited integration between Southern shore partners, whose integration is almost completely driven by linkages with Southern European developed countries.","Ayadi, Rym; Giovannetti, Giorgia; Marvasi, Enrico; Vannelli, Giulio; Zaki, Chahir",World econ,,455

A common observation in age-related metabolic diseases is an increment in systemic inflammation (the so-called inflammaging) where mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may have a key role. Exercise prevents these metabolic pathologies, at least in part, due to its ability to alter immunometabolism, e.g., reducing systemic inflammation and by improving immune cell metabolism. Here, we review how exercise regulates immunometabolism within contracting muscles. In fact, we discuss how circulating and resident macrophages alter their function due to mitochondrial signaling, and we propose how these effects can be triggered within skeletal muscle in response to exercise. Finally, we also describe how exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations can help to fight against virus infection. Moreover, the fact that moderate exercise increases circulating immune cells must be taken into account by public health agencies, as it may help prevent virus spread. This is of interest in order to face not only acute respiratory-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic but also for future virus infection challenges.","Casuso, Rafael A.; Huertas, Jesús R.",Life (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/life11010061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467642/,455

The general objective of the study is to evaluate the early impact of the Covid-19 emergency and quarantine on the well-being and work practices of mental health service personnel and professionals. Data were collected through an online survey of workers and professionals working with people with mental health problems in Lombardy in several outpatient and inpatient services. Their socio-demographic characteristics, professional background, description of working conditions during lockdown and psychological distress levels were collected. All analyses were performed on a sample of 241. Approximately, 31% of the participants obtained a severe score in at least one of the burnout dimensions, 11.6% showed moderate or severe levels of anxiety, and 6.6% had a moderate or severe level of depression. Different work conditions and patterns of distress were found for outpatient service workers and inpatient service workers. The overall impact of the Covid-19 emergency on mental health workers’ level of distress was mild, although a significant number of workers experienced severe levels of depersonalization and anxiety.

However, these tests require cold‐chain shipping to distribute, and the labor of skilled technicians to assemble reactions and interpret the results. Strategies to reduce shipping and labor costs at the point‐of‐care could aid in diagnostic testing scale‐up and response to the COVID‐19 outbreak, as well as in future outbreaks. In this study we test both lab‐developed and commercial SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnostic RT‐qPCR mixes for the ability to be stabilized against elevated temperature by lyophilization. Fully assembled reactions were lyophilized and stored for up to a month at ambient or elevated temperature and were subsequently assayed for their ability to detect dilutions of synthetic SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA. Of the mixes tested, we show that one commercial mix can maintain activity and sensitivity after storage for at least 30 days at ambient temperature after lyophilization. We also demonstrate that lyoprotectants such as disaccharides can stabilize freeze‐dried diagnostic reactions against elevated temperatures (up to 50°C) for at least 30 days. We anticipate that the incorporation of these methods into SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnostic testing will improve testing pipelines by reducing labor at the testing facility and eliminating the need for cold‐chain shipping.","Hammerling, Michael J.; Warfel, Katherine F.; Jewett, Michael C.",Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33964860/; https://doi.org/10.1002/biot.202000572,455

Maternally derived serum antibody to bovine parvovirus was found to have a half-life of 19 days. On all three properties, calves developed intestinal bovine parvovirus infection with seroconversion soon after weaning. This occurred more promptly where the environment was subject to heavier bovine parvovirus contamination due to management practices. The concurrent presence of moderate levels of residual serum antibody had only minor influence on the onset of the infection. On one beef cattle property, onset of intestinal bovine parvovirus infection was associated with an outbreak of post-weaning diarrhoea. Anthelmintic treatment trials indicated that this syndrome was unrelated to helminth burdens, though coccidi-osis appeared responsible for occasional subsequent cases of dysentery. It was considered that bovine parvovirus may have significantly contributed to the development of the diarrhoea syndrome, in conjunction with substantial weaning stresses.","Durham, P.J.K.; Johnson, R.

Two diametrically opposite hypotheses can be formulated: a) The altered lifestyle due to the lock-down measures as well as vast application of telemedicine has a beneficial effect on the health status of the majority of the adult population, reducing thus demand for emergency health services. b) Despite increased health needs, people choose to avoid interactions with the health system and the ER out of fear of getting infected with COVID-19 resulting in a health services underusage. ER and HS indicators can be useful in monitoring and interpreting the underlying causes of reduced hospital ER services demand.

However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 - 0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.","Bell, V.; Wade, D.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082669; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20082669v1?rss=1,455

Resveratrol, a well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory triphenolic stilbene, is abundant in red grapes, red wine, dark chocolate, and peanut butter. Alternatively, pterostilbene-zinc combination might be also considered without using a nano-carrier. We recommend conducting prompt clinical trials to assess the potential of the suggested combinations as a monotherapy for mild COVID-19 with a potential to prevent its progression to moderate-severe disease for which we recommend their trial as an adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, the suggested combinations might also possess a pharmacotherapeutic potential that exceeds COVID-19 to various inflammatory, immunologic, and oncologic diseases.","Kelleni, Mina T.",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S075333222100411X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S075333222100411X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894625/,455

631141,COVID-19 wastewater surveillance: An African perspective,2020-07-03,"Background Elevated Interleukin-6 (IL-6) may play an important role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 yet attenuated response is not seen across all severe patients. We aimed to determine the effect of IL-6 baseline levels and other clinical variables on mortality and outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients as well as to explore genetic variants associated with attenuated IL-6 response. Methods Baseline IL-6 cytokine levels were measured in hospitalized patients participating in ongoing ODYSSEY phase 3 randomized study of tradipitant and placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who are receiving supplemental oxygen support. Furthermore blood samples for whole genome sequencing analysis were collected from 150 participants. Results We report significantly elevated IL-6 in COVID-19 infected hospitalized patients, n=100 (p-value<0.0001) when compared to controls n=324. We also report a significantly increased level of IL-6 (p-value<0.01) between the severe and mild COVID-19 patients with severity defined on a WHO scale. Excessive IL-6 plasma levels correlate with higher mortality (p-value 0.001). Additionally based on our classification analysis, combination of IL-6 elevation and high levels of serum glucose can identify highest risk-group of COVID19 patients. Furthermore we explore the role of genetic regulatory variants affecting baseline IL-6 levels specifically in COVID-19 patients. We have directly tested the association between variants in the IL6 and IL6R gene region and IL6 plasma levels. We provide results of common IL-6 variant previously associated with pneumonia, rs1800795, and rs2228145 that was previously shown to affect IL-6 plasma levels, as well as report on novel variants associated with IL-6 plasma levels detected in our study patients. Conclusions While it is unlikely that “cytokine storm” is the norm in severe COVID19, baseline elevations above 150pg/ml may be associated with worst outcomes and as such may warrant treatment considerations. So far no clinical studies used IL-6 baseline assessment to stratify patient population participating in clinical studies. We believe that careful examination and interpretation of the IL-6 levels and genetic variants can help to determine patient population with potentially most robust clinical response to IL-6 inhibition.

Research Question How do regional differences and perceived lack of ICU resources affect critical care resource utilization and the well-being of HCPs? Study Design and Methods Between April 23rd-May 7th 2020, we electronically administered a 41-question survey to interdisciplinary HCPs caring for critically ill COVID-19 patients. The survey was distributed via critical care societies, research networks, personal contacts, and social media portals. Responses were tabulated by World Bank region. We performed multivariate log-binomial regression to assess factors associated with three main outcomes: 1) Limiting mechanical ventilation (MV), 2) changes in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) practices, and 3) emotional distress or burnout. Results We included 2700 respondents from 77 countries, including physicians (41%), nurses (40%), respiratory therapists (10%) and advanced practice providers (8%). The reported lack of ICU nurses was higher than that of intensivists (32% vs 15%). Limiting MV for COVID-19 patients was reported by 16% of respondents, was lowest in North America (10%), and was associated with reduced ventilator availability (aRR:2.10, 95% CI:1.61-2.74). Overall, 66% of respondents reported changes in CPR practices. Emotional distress or burnout was high across regions (52%, highest in North America), and associated with female gender (aRR:1.16, 95% CI:1.01-1.33), being a nurse (aRR:1.31, 95% CI:1.13-1.53), reporting a shortage of ICU nurses (aRR:1.18, 95% CI:1.05-1.33) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) (aRR:1.30 95% CI:1.09-1.55), as well as experiencing poor communication from supervisors (aRR:1.30, 95% CI:1.16-1.46). Interpretation Our findings demonstrate variability in ICU resource availability and utilization worldwide. The high prevalence of provider burnout, and its association with reported insufficient resources and poor communication from supervisors suggest a need for targeted interventions to support HCPs on the front lines.","Wahlster, Sarah; Sharma, Monisha; Lewis, Ariane K.; Patel, Pratik V.; Hartog, Christiane; Jannotta, Gemi; Blissitt, Patricia; Kross, Erin K.; Kassebaum, Nicholas J.; Greer, David M.; Curtis, J.

644234,Effect of park use and landscape structure on COVID-19 transmission rates,2021-06-02,"The emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East in 2012 was associated with an overwhelming uncertainty about its epidemiological and clinical characteristics. Once dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) was found to be the natural reservoir of the virus, the public health systems across the Arabian Peninsula encountered an unprecedented pressure to control its transmission. This view point describes how the One Health approach was used in Qatar to manage the MERS-CoV outbreak during the period 2012–2017. One Health focuses on the association between the human, animals and environment sectors for total health and wellbeing of these three sectors. To manage the MERS outbreak in Qatar through a One Health approach, the Qatar National Outbreak Control Taskforce (OCT) was reactivated in November 2012. The animal health sector was invited to join the OCT. Later on, technical expertise was requested from the WHO, FAO, CDC, EMC, and PHE. Subsequently, a comprehensive One Health roadmap was delivered through leadership and coordination; surveillance and investigation; epidemiological studies and increase of local diagnostic capacity. The joint OCT, once trained had easy access to allocated resources and high risk areas to provide more evidence on the potential source of the virus and to investigate all reported cases within 24–48 h. Lack of sufficient technical guidance on veterinary surveillance and poor risk perception among the vulnerable population constituted major obstacles to maintain systematic One Health performance.","Farag, Elmoubasher; Nour, Mohamed; Islam, Md.

Prior research has linked similar public safety measures (i.e., quarantine) with suicide risk, in addition to supporting the role of social connection in suicidal thoughts and behaviors; consequently, there is a need to better understand the relationship between widespread social distancing policies and suicide risk. The current study aimed to examine the prospective association between COVID‐19‐related social distancing practices and suicidal ideation. METHODS: Participants (N = 472) completed measures of suicidal ideation and impacts of social distancing practices at baseline and two weeks later. RESULTS: After controlling for general psychosocial distress (i.e., depression, social connectedness), cross‐lagged regression models identified prospective, bidirectional relationships between perceived impacts of social distancing on one's mental health and both passive and active suicidal ideation. The impact of social distancing on work/social routine was not associated with suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings suggest the importance of an individual's perception regarding the effect of social distancing on their mental health, rather than the disruption to work or social routine, in suicide risk.

This is not due to aging alone but also because we lead unhealthy lifestyles with little or no exercise and typically consume food with poor nutritional content. This paper proffers the design science research method to create an artefact that can help people study the diffusion of serious games. The ultimate goal of the study is to create a serious game that can help people to improve their balance in physical exercise, nutrition and well-being. To do this, first we conducted 97 interviews to study if wearables can be used for gathering health data. Analysis indicates that designers, manufacturers, and developers of wearables and associated software and apps should make their devices reliable, relevant, and user friendly. To increase the diffusion, adoption, and habitual usage of wearables key issues such as privacy and security need to be addressed as well. Then, we created a paper prototype and conducted a further 32 interviews to validate the first prototype of the game, especially with respect to the diffusion possibilities of the game. Results are positive from a formal technology acceptance point of view showing relevance and usefulness. But informally in the open questions some limitations also became visible. In particular, ease of use is extremely important for acceptance and calling it a game can in fact be an obstruction. Moreover, the artefact should not be patronizing and age differences can also pose problems, hence the title not to make the serious game too serious. Future research plans to address these problems in the next iteration while the future implementation plan seeks for big platforms or companies to diffuse the serious game. A key theoretical contribution of this research is the identification of habit as a potential dependent variable for the intention to use wearables and the development of a diffusion model for serious games. The hedonic perspective is added to the model as well as trust and perceived risks. This model ends the cycle of critical design with an improvement of theory as result contributing to the societal goal of decreasing Obesities and Diabetes.","Spil, Ton A.M.; Romijnders, Vincent; Sundaram, David; Wickramasinghe, Nilmini; Kijl, Björn",Int J Inf Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836650/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102202; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268401219315555; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401219315555,455

They are widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world and causing huge economic losses. The diagnosis of these agents is very difficult due to non-specific nature of lesions and the involvement of some intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. We performed postmortem of 45 calves, which was below three months of age. Out of 45 necropscid calves, three (6.66%) cases were positive for BRoV and four (8.88%) cases were found positive for BCoV, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further RT-PCR positive cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue sections. Three cases of enteritis caused by BRoV showed the hallmark lesions of the shortening and fusion of villi, denudation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. The BRoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, peyer's patches in the ileum and strong immunoreactions in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of the mesenteric lymph nodes.

654978,"Waste generation, Wealth and GHG emissions from the waste sector: Is Denmark on the path towards Circular Economy?",2020-09-25,"BACKGROUND: Peer workers or “peers” (workers with past or present drug use experience) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives, and their role is essential in creating safe spaces for people who use drugs (PWUD). Working in overdose response settings has benefits for peer workers but is also stressful, with lasting emotional and mental health effects. Yet, little is known about the stressors peer workers face and what interventions can be implemented to support them in their roles. METHODS: This project used a community-based sequential mixed-methods research design. Eight peer researcher-led focus groups (n = 31) were conducted between November 2018 and March 2019 to assess needs of peer workers. The transcripts were thematically coded and analysed using interpretative description. These results informed a survey, which was conducted (n = 50) in September 2019 to acquire quantitative data on peer workers’ perception of health, quality of life, working conditions and stressors. Frequency distributions were used to describe characteristics of participants. X(2) distribution values with Yates correction were conducted to check for association between variables. RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the focus groups that point to stressors felt by peer workers: (1) financial insecurity; (2) lack of respect and recognition at work; (3) housing challenges; (4) inability to access and/or refer individuals to resources; and (5) constant exposure to death and trauma. Consistent with this, the factors that survey participants picked as one of their “top three stressors” included financial situation, work situation, and housing challenges. CONCLUSION: Peer workers are faced with a diversity of stressors in their lives which often reflect societal stigmatization of drug use. Recognition of these systemic stressors is critical in designing interventions to ease the emotional, physical and financial burden faced by peer workers.","Mamdani, Zahra; McKenzie, Sophie; Pauly, Bernadette; Cameron, Fred; Conway-Brown, Jennifer; Edwards, Denice; Howell, Amy; Scott, Tracy; Seguin, Ryan; Woodrow, Peter; Buxton, Jane A.",Harm Reduct J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573661/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00449-1,455

It causes respiratory infection with signs and symptoms of common infectious agents. Thus, clinicians sometimes may miss the H1N1 patient. Clinical laboratory tests are important for the diagnosis of the H1N1 infection. There are several tests available, however, the rapid test and direct fluorescence antigen test are unable to rule out the influenza virus infection and viral culture test is time consuming. Therefore, nucleic acid amplification techniques based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays are regarded as a specific diagnosis to confirm the influenza virus infection. Although the nucleic acid-based techniques are highly sensitive and specific, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase could limit the utility of the techniques. In addition, their use depends on the availability, cost and throughput of the diagnostic techniques. To overcome these drawbacks, evaluation and development of the techniques should be continued.

The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-S titer but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting therapeutic plasma with desired functionalities.","Morgenlander, William; Henson, Stephanie; Monaco, Daniel; Chen, Athena; Littlefield, Kirsten; Bloch, Evan M.; Fujimura, Eric; Ruczinski, Ingo; Crowley, Andrew R.; Natarajan, Harini; Butler, Savannah E.; Weiner, Joshua A.; Li, Mamie Z.; Bonny, Tania S.; Benner, Sarah E.; Ashwin Balagopal,; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C.; Eshleman, Susan; Casadevall, Arturo; Redd, Andrew D.; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Ackerman, Margaret E.; Pekosz, Andrew; Elledge, Stephen J.; Robinson, Matthew; Tobian, Aaron A.R.; Larman, H.

678302,"St Andrew's COVID-19 Surgery Safety (StACS) Study: Elective Plastic Surgery, Trauma & Burns",2020-08-21,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease with a high morbidity and mortality by the FIP virus (FIPV, virulent feline coronavirus). Several antiviral drugs for FIP have been identified, but many of these are expensive and not available in veterinary medicine. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by several countries to treat malaria and immune-mediated diseases in humans, and its antiviral effects on other viral infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus) have been confirmed. We investigated whether HCQ in association with interferon-ω (IFN-ω) is effective for FIPV in vitro. A total of 100 μM of HCQ significantly inhibited the replication of types I and II FIPV. Interestingly, the combination of 100 μM of HCQ and 10(4) U/mL of recombinant feline IFN-ω (rfIFN-ω, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV infection. Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-ω are applicable for treatment of FIP. Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-ω will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.","Takano, Tomomi; Satoh, Kumi; Doki, Tomoyoshi; Tanabe, Taishi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32456286/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050576,455
682008,Reply: The COVID-19 Pandemic: Crisis Management for Plastic Surgeons.,2021-07-06,"OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate patient‐reported oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) using pulse oximetry as a home monitoring tool for patients with initially non‐severe COVID‐19 to identify need for hospitalization. METHODS: Patients were enrolled at the emergency department (ED) and outpatient testing centers. Each patient was given a home pulse oximeter and instructed to record their SpO(2) every eight hours. Patients were instructed to return to the ED for sustained home SpO(2) <92% or if they felt they needed emergent medical attention. Relative risk was used to assess the relation between hospitalization and home SpO(2) <92% in COVID‐19 positive patients. RESULTS: We enrolled 209 patients with suspected COVID‐19, of which 77 patients tested positive for COVID‐19 and were included. Subsequent hospitalization occurred in 22/77 (29%) patients. Resting home SpO(2) <92% was associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization compared to SpO(2) ≥92% [RR 7.0 (95% CI 3.4 – 14.5), p‐value <0.0001]. Home SpO2 <92% was also associated with increased risk of ICU admission, ARDS and septic shock. In our cohort, 50% of patients who ended up hospitalized only returned to the ED for incidental finding of low home SpO(2) without worsening of symptoms. One‐third (33%) of non‐hospitalized patients stated they would have returned to the ED if they did not have a pulse oximeter to reassure them at home. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that home pulse oximetry monitoring identifies need for hospitalization in initially non‐severe COVID‐19 patients when a cut off of SpO(2) 92% is used. Half of patients who ended up hospitalized had SpO(2) <92% without worsening symptoms. Home SpO(2) monitoring also reduces unnecessary ED revisits.","Shah, Sonia; Majmudar, Kaushal; Stein, Amy; Gupta, Nita; Suppes, Spencer; Karamanis, Marina; Capannari, Joseph; Sethi, Sanjay; Patte, Christine",Acad Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779828/,455

685214,Can PM(2.5) pollution worsen the death rate due to COVID-19 in India and Pakistan?,2020-11-10,"Loneliness has been considered a major challenge since long before the pandemic. Changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic included modifications in social communications and activities. Thus, it was expected that loneliness would increase during the pandemic. The first studies of loneliness during the pandemic revealed inconsistent results. We hypothesized that physical isolation led to changes in the quality of relationships; thus, loneliness trends could be different from those predicted. For our study we used methods to measure loneliness: the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale (SELSA-S) for Adults and Older Adults; the Multidimensional Inventory of Loneliness Experience; and demographic data. Participants were middle-aged and older middle-aged adults (n = 457) aged 35–59 (M = 45.5, SD = 6.88, 35.4% males). Participants came from two studies: Study 1 consisted of 280 participants aged 35–59 (M = 44.8; SD = 6.93; 29.6% males), the study was conducted before the pandemic in late 2019; participants in Study 2 were adults (n = 177) aged 35–59 (M = 46.5; SD = 6.68; 44.6% males), data were collected in the fall of 2020. The results did not confirm increase in loneliness; moreover, participants reported lower scores of loneliness in some domains. Regression analyses showed that general experience of loneliness was predicted by different loneliness characteristics in pre-pandemic and pandemic age groups. We found some similar mechanisms that were activated within different situations. Our results confirmed the complex nature of loneliness, they argue that pandemic effects were not limited to increase in loneliness and that the mechanism of loneliness can adjust to environmental factors.","Strizhitskaya, Olga; Petrash, Marina; Murtazina, Inna; Vartanyan, Gayane; Shchukin, Anton",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574812/,455
687797,The impact of shipping CO2 emissions from marine traffic in Western Singapore Straits during COVID-19,2021,"Remote delivery poses numerous challenges, particularly for discussion-based classes. Here, we describe a class management model that uses a conversational approach between instructional coleaders to introduce topics and facilitate student discussions. The conversational approach enabled us to model various aspects of the scientific process, such as asking questions and generating hypotheses, aimed at an emergent subject, such as COVID-19. Students’ feedback was positive, noting how the class enabled them to connect their existing knowledge with the daily influx of new insights about SARS-CoV-2. While our class focuses on COVID-19-related topics, this model of a conversational style class can be easily implemented for other course topics.","Chiu, Chi-hua; Piontkivska, Helen",J Microbiol Biol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884069/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2317,455
687993,Ecotoxicological and physiological risks of microplastics on fish and their possible mitigation measures,2021,"AIMS: Our observational study aimed to evaluate the impact of the lockdown period due to 2019 Coronavirus disease pandemic on glycaemic control in a cohort of paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: Eighty-five patients with T1D aged 5–18 years using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data, including glucose metrics generated by CGM-specific web-based cloud platforms, were collected in three different periods (pre-lockdown phase, lockdown phase, and post-lockdown phase) of 90 days each and were statistically analysed. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, a clear improvement in almost all CGM metrics (time in range, time above range, coefficient of variation, and glucose management indicator) was observed in our study population, regardless of age and insulin type treatment. In the months following lockdown, maintaining satisfactory diabetes outcomes was confirmed only in younger patients (aged 5–9 years) and in those individuals on hybrid closed loop therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing use of innovative technological devices together with data sharing systems and interaction with multidisciplinary diabetes team through telemedicine allowed paediatric patients with T1D to improve glucose metrics during the lockdown period. However, our findings showed that the achievement of better glycaemic control was transient for most patients.","Lombardo, Fortunato; Salzano, Giuseppina; Bombaci, Bruno; Basile, Pietro; Lucania, Giovanni; Alibrandi, Angela; Passanisi, Stefano",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2021.108988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331977/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822721003478; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822721003478,455
