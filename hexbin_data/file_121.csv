247,247,247,Low-Cost HIV-1 Diagnosis and Quantification in Dried Blood Spots by Real Time PCR,11.480447,8.693538,2009-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Rapid and cost-effective methods for HIV-1 diagnosis and viral load monitoring would greatly enhance the clinical management of HIV-1 infected adults and children in limited-resource settings. Recent recommendations to treat perinatally infected infants within the first year of life are feasible only if early diagnosis is routinely available. Dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper are an easy and convenient way to collect and transport blood samples. A rapid and cost effective method to diagnose and quantify HIV-1 from DBS is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have developed a real-time LightCycler (rtLC) PCR assay to detect and quantify HIV-1 from DBS. HIV-1 RNA extracted from DBS was amplified in a one-step, single-tube system using primers specific for long-terminal repeat sequences that are conserved across all HIV-1 clades. SYBR Green dye was used to quantify PCR amplicons and HIV-1 RNA copy numbers were determined from a standard curve generated using serially diluted known copies of HIV-1 RNA. This assay detected samples across clades, has a dynamic range of 5 log(10), and %CV <8% up to 4 log(10) dilution. Plasma HIV-1 RNA copy numbers obtained using this method correlated well with the Roche Ultrasensitive (r = 0.91) and branched DNA (r = 0.89) assays. The lower limit of detection (95%) was estimated to be 136 copies. The rtLC DBS assay was 2.5 fold rapid as well as 40-fold cheaper when compared to commercial assays. Adaptation of the assay into other real-time systems demonstrated similar performance. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy, reliability, genotype inclusivity and affordability, along with the small volumes of blood required for the assay suggest that the rtLC DBS assay will be useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric HIV-1 infection in resource-limited settings.","Mehta, Nishaki; Trzmielina, Sonia; Nonyane, Bareng A.

Herein, we report a detailed analysis of plasmablast and monoclonal antibody responses induced by pandemic H1N1 infection in humans. Unlike antibodies elicited by annual influenza vaccinations, most neutralizing antibodies induced by pandemic H1N1 infection were broadly cross-reactive against epitopes in the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk and head domain of multiple influenza strains. The antibodies were from cells that had undergone extensive affinity maturation. Based on these observations, we postulate that the plasmablasts producing these broadly neutralizing antibodies were predominantly derived from activated memory B cells specific for epitopes conserved in several influenza strains. Consequently, most neutralizing antibodies were broadly reactive against divergent H1N1 and H5N1 influenza strains. This suggests that a pan-influenza vaccine may be possible, given the right immunogen. Antibodies generated potently protected and rescued mice from lethal challenge with pandemic H1N1 or antigenically distinct influenza strains, making them excellent therapeutic candidates.","Wrammert, Jens; Koutsonanos, Dimitrios; Li, Gui-Mei; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Sui, Jianhua; Morrissey, Michael; McCausland, Megan; Skountzou, Ioanna; Hornig, Mady; Lipkin, W.

721,721,721,"HMGB1, an alarmin promoting HIV dissemination and latency in dendritic cells",11.472559,8.420677,2011-10-28,"Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate immune responses by transporting antigens and migrating to lymphoid tissues to initiate T-cell responses. DCs are located in the mucosal surfaces that are involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and they are probably among the earliest targets of HIV-1 infection. DCs have an important role in viral transmission and dissemination, and HIV-1 has evolved different strategies to evade DC antiviral activity. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a DNA-binding nuclear protein that can act as an alarmin, a danger signal to alert the innate immune system for the initiation of host defense. It is the prototypic damage-associated molecular pattern molecule, and it can be secreted by innate cells, including DCs and natural killer (NK) cells. The fate of DCs is dependent on a cognate interaction with NK cells, which involves HMGB1 expressed at NK–DC synapse. HMGB1 is essential for DC maturation, migration to lymphoid tissues and functional type-1 polarization of naïve T cells. This review highlights the latest advances in our understanding of the impact of HIV on the interactions between HMGB1 and DCs, focusing on the mechanisms of HMGB1-dependent viral dissemination and persistence in DCs, and discussing the consequences on antiviral innate immunity, immune activation and HIV pathogenesis.","Gougeon, M-L; Melki, M-T; Saïdi, H",Cell Death Differ,121,8

RSV strongly upregulates proinflammatory cytokines and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Clarithromycin (CAM), which is an antimicrobial agent and is also known as an immunomodulator, significantly suppressed RSV-induced production of interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). CAM also suppressed RSV-induced PAF receptor expression and adhesion of fluorescein-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells. The RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion was thought to be mediated by the host cell's PAF receptor. CAM, which exhibits antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found in this study to suppress the RSV-induced adhesion of respiratory disease-causing bacteria, S. pneumoniae, to host cells. Thus, CAM might suppress immunological disorders and prevent secondary bacterial infections during RSV infection.","Yokota, Shin-ichi; Okabayashi, Tamaki; Hirakawa, Satoshi; Tsutsumi, Hiroyuki; Himi, Tetsuo; Fujii, Nobuhiro",Mediators Inflamm,121,28
993,993,993,What was the primary mode of smallpox transmission? Implications for biodefense,11.352279,8.7387295,2012-11-29,"The mode of infection transmission has profound implications for effective containment by public health interventions. The mode of smallpox transmission was never conclusively established. Although, “respiratory droplet” transmission was generally regarded as the primary mode of transmission, the relative importance of large ballistic droplets and fine particle aerosols that remain suspended in air for more than a few seconds was never resolved. This review examines evidence from the history of variolation, data on mucosal infection collected in the last decades of smallpox transmission, aerosol measurements, animal models, reports of smallpox lung among healthcare workers, and the epidemiology of smallpox regarding the potential importance of fine particle aerosol mediated transmission. I introduce briefly the term anisotropic infection to describe the behavior of Variola major in which route of infection appears to have altered the severity of disease.","Milton, Donald K.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,121,8

However, commercial assays are expensive and cost prohibitive for many clinical laboratories. To overcome fiscal challenges, a cost effective strategy was developed using a combination of homogenization and heat treatment with an “in-house” real-time PCR. In 196 swabs submitted for adenovirus detection, this crude extraction method showed performance characteristics equivalent to viral DNA obtained from a commercial nucleic acid extraction. In addition, the in-house real-time PCR outperformed traditional testing strategies using virus culture, with sensitivities of 100% and 69.2%, respectively. Overall, the combination of homogenization and heat treatment with a sensitive in-house real-time PCR provides accurate results at a cost comparable to viral culture.","Al-Siyabi, Turkiya; Binkhamis, Khalifa; Wilcox, Melanie; Wong, Sallene; Pabbaraju, Kanti; Tellier, Raymond; Hatchette, Todd F; LeBlanc, Jason J",Virol J,121,1
1227,1227,1227,"Proposals for the classification of human rhinovirus species A, B and C into genotypically assigned types",11.829452,8.7442045,2013-08-11,"Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) frequently cause mild upper respiratory tract infections and more severe disease manifestations such as bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbations. HRV is classified into three species within the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. HRV species A and B contain 75 and 25 serotypes identified by cross-neutralization assays, although the use of such assays for routine HRV typing is hampered by the large number of serotypes, replacement of virus isolation by molecular methods in HRV diagnosis and the poor or absent replication of HRV species C in cell culture. To address these problems, we propose an alternative, genotypic classification of HRV-based genetic relatedness analogous to that used for enteroviruses. Nucleotide distances between 384 complete VP1 sequences of currently assigned HRV (sero)types identified divergence thresholds of 13, 12 and 13 % for species A, B and C, respectively, that divided inter- and intra-type comparisons. These were paralleled by 10, 9.5 and 10 % thresholds in the larger dataset of >3800 VP4 region sequences. Assignments based on VP1 sequences led to minor revisions of existing type designations (such as the reclassification of serotype pairs, e.g. A8/A95 and A29/A44, as single serotypes) and the designation of new HRV types A101–106, B101–103 and C34–C51. A protocol for assignment and numbering of new HRV types using VP1 sequences and the restriction of VP4 sequence comparisons to type identification and provisional type assignments is proposed. Genotypic assignment and identification of HRV types will be of considerable value in the future investigation of type-associated differences in disease outcomes, transmission and epidemiology.","McIntyre, Chloe L.; Knowles, Nick J.; Simmonds, Peter",J Gen Virol,121,11
1360,1360,1360,Resting of Cryopreserved PBMC Does Not Generally Benefit the Performance of Antigen-Specific T Cell ELISPOT Assays,11.64658,8.369058,2012-07-30,"T cell monitoring is increasingly performed using cryopreserved PBMC. It has been suggested that resting of PBMC after thawing, that is, culturing them overnight in test medium, produces higher antigen-induced spot counts in ELISPOT assays. To evaluate the importance of overnight resting, we systematically tested cryopreserved PBMC from 25 healthy donors. CEF peptides (comprising CMV, EBV and flu antigens) were used to stimulate CD8 cells and mumps antigen to stimulate CD4 cells. The data show that resting significantly increased antigen-elicited T cell responses only for CEF high responder PBMC. The maximal gain observed was doubling of spot counts. For CEF low responders, and for mumps responders of either low- or high reactivity levels, resting had no statistically significant effect on the observed spot counts. Therefore, resting is not a generally applicable approach to improve ELISPOT assay performance, but can be recommended only for clinical subject cohorts and antigens for which it has a proven benefit. Because resting invariably leads to losing about half of the PBMC available for testing, and because doubling the PBMC numbers plated into the assay reliably doubles the antigen-induced spot counts, we suggest the latter approach as a simple and reliable alternative to resting for enhancing the performance of ELISPOT assays. Our data imply that resting is not required if PBMC were cryopreserved and thawed under conditions that minimize apoptosis of the cells. Therefore, this study should draw attention to the need to optimize freezing and thawing conditions for successful T cell work.","Kuerten, Stefanie; Batoulis, Helena; Recks, Mascha S.; Karacsony, Edith; Zhang, Wenji; Subbramanian, Ramu A.; Lehmann, Paul V.",Cells,121,8

The intergenic region (IGR) IRES of the Dicistroviridae uses a streamlined mechanism in which it can directly recruit the ribosome in the absence of initiation factors and initiates translation using a non-AUG codon. A subset of IGR IRESs including that from the honey bee viruses can also direct translation of an overlapping +1 frame gene. In this study, we systematically examined cellular conditions that lead to IGR IRES-mediated 0 and +1 frame translation in Drosophila S2 cells. Towards this, a novel bicistronic reporter that exploits the 2A “stop-go” peptide was developed to allow the detection of IRES-mediated translation in vivo. Both 0 and +1 frame translation by the IGR IRES are stimulated under a number of cellular stresses and in S2 cells infected by cricket paralysis virus, demonstrating a switch from cap-dependent to IRES-dependent translation. The regulation of the IGR IRES mechanism ensures that both 0 frame viral structural proteins and +1 frame ORFx protein are optimally expressed during virus infection.","Wang, Qing S.; Jan, Eric",PLoS One,121,1

Airway surface liquid (ASL), which is regulated by epithelial cell ion transport, is essential for normal lung function. No information is available regarding the effect of NGF on ion transport of airway epithelium. To investigate whether NGF can affect ion transport, human primary air‐interface cultured epithelial cells were placed in Ussing chambers to obtain transepithelial voltage (−7.1 ± 3.4 mV), short‐circuit current (I(sc), 5.9 ± 1.0 μA), and transepithelial resistance (750 Ω·cm(2)), and to measure responses to ion transport inhibitors. Amiloride (apical, 3.5 × 10(−5) mol/L) decreased I(sc) by 55.3%. Apically applied NGF (1 ng/mL) reduced I(sc) by 5.3% in 5 min; basolaterally applied NGF had no effect. The response to amiloride was reduced (41.6%) in the presence of NGF. K‐252a (10 nmol/L, apical) did not itself affect Na(+) transport, but it attenuated the NGF‐induced reduction in Na(+) transport, indicating the participation of the trkA receptor in the NGF‐induced reduction in Na(+) transport. PD‐98059 (30 μmol/L, apical and basolateral) did not itself affect Na(+) transport, but attenuated the NGF‐induced reduction in Na(+) transport, indicating that trkA activated the Erk 1/2 signaling cascade. NGF stimulated phosphorylation of Erk 1/2 and the β‐subunit of ENaC. K‐252a and PD‐98059 inhibited these responses. NGF had no effect on I(sc) in the presence of apical nystatin (50 μmol/L). These results indicate that NGF inhibits Na(+) transport through a trkA‐Erk 1/2‐activated signaling pathway linked to ENaC phosphorylation.","Shimko, Michael J.; Zaccone, Eric J.; Thompson, Janet A.; Schwegler‐Berry, Diane; Kashon, Michael L.; Fedan, Jeffrey S.",Physiol Rep,121,11

Various cell types produce IL-8, either in response to external stimuli such as cytokines or bacterial infection, or after malignant transformation. Anti-IL-8 strategies have been considered for anti-inflammatory therapy. In this paper we demonstrate that the RNA interference technique can be used to efficiently down-regulate IL-8 protein expression in airway epithelial cells. We used a helper-dependent adenoviral vector to express a small hairpin (sh)RNA targeting human IL-8 in cultured airway epithelial cells (IB3-1, Cftr(−/−); C38, Cftr-corrected) stimulated with TNF-α, IL-1β or heat-inactivated Burkholderia cenocepacia. Stimulated IL-8 expression in IB3-1 and C38 cells was significantly reduced by shRNA expression. The shRNA targeting IL-8 had no effect on the activation of NF-κB, or on the protein levels of IκB or IL-6, suggesting that this anti-IL-8 strategy was highly specific, and therefore may offer potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

However, HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells become progressively more “exhausted” as chronic HIV infection proceeds. Symptoms of T cell exhaustion range from expression of inhibitory receptors and selective loss of cytokine production capacity through reduced proliferative potential, impaired differentiation into effector cells and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. While effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) durably reduces HIV viremia to undetectable levels, this alone does not restore the full pluripotency of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. In a number of studies, a subset of peptide epitope variants categorized as heteroclitic, restimulated more potent cellular immune responses in vitro than did the native, immunizing peptides themselves. This property of heteroclitic peptides has been exploited in experimental cancer and chronic viral infection models to promote clearance of transformed cells and persistent viruses. In this review, we consider the possibility that heteroclitic peptides could improve the efficacy of therapeutic vaccines as part of HIV immunotherapy or eradication strategies. We review literature on heteroclitic peptides and illustrate their potential to beneficially modulate the nature of HIV-specific T cell responses toward those found in the small minority of HIV-infected, aviremic cART-naïve persons termed elite controllers or long-term non-progressors. Our review suggests that the efficacy of HIV vaccines could be improved by identification, testing, and incorporation of heteroclitic variants of native HIV peptide epitopes.","Adegoke, Adeolu Oyemade; Grant, Michael David",Front Immunol,121,8

The virus is an exclusively human pathogen and thus also termed as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV4). It was the first oncogenic virus recognized and has been incriminated in the causation of tumors of both lymphatic and epithelial nature. It was reported in some previous studies that 95% of the population worldwide are serologically positive to the virus. Clinically, EBV primary infection is almost silent, persisting as a life-long asymptomatic latent infection in B cells although it may be responsible for a transient clinical syndrome called infectious mononucleosis. Following reactivation of the virus from latency due to immunocompromised status, EBV was found to be associated with several tumors. EBV linked to oncogenesis as detected in lymphoid tumors such as Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and T-cell lymphomas (e.g. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas; PTCL and Anaplastic large cell lymphomas; ALCL). It is also linked to epithelial tumors such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), gastric carcinomas and oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL). In vitro, EBV many studies have demonstrated its ability to transform B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Despite these malignancies showing different clinical and epidemiological patterns when studied, genetic studies have suggested that these EBV- associated transformations were characterized generally by low level of virus gene expression with only the latent virus proteins (LVPs) upregulated in both tumors and LCLs.

The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice. RESULTS: In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, 4 μg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose- and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 μg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi.

2189,2189,2189,Rab5-mediated VE-cadherin internalization regulates the barrier function of the lung microvascular endothelium,11.7675,8.364254,2015-06-26,"The small GTPase Rab5 has been well defined to control the vesicle-mediated plasma membrane protein transport to the endosomal compartment. However, its function in the internalization of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, an important component of adherens junctions, and as a result regulating the endothelial cell polarity and barrier function remain unknown. Here, we demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) simulation markedly enhanced the activation and expression of Rab5 in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), which is accompanied by VE-cadherin internalization. In parallel, LPS challenge also induced abnormal cell polarity and dysfunction of the endothelial barrier in HPMECs. LPS stimulation promoted the translocation of VE-cadherin from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments, and intracellularly expressed VE-cadherin was extensively colocalized with Rab5. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of Rab5a expression attenuated the disruption of LPS-induced internalization of VE-cadherin and the disorder of cell polarity. Furthermore, knockdown of Rab5 inhibited the vascular endothelial hyperpermeability and protected endothelial barrier function from LPS injury, both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that Rab5 is a critical mediator of LPS-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, which is likely mediated through regulating VE-cadherin internalization. These findings provide evidence, implicating that Rab5a is a potential therapeutic target for preventing endothelial barrier disruption and vascular inflammation.

(2012) Molecular and phylogenetic analysis of matrix gene of avian influenza viruses isolated from wild birds and live bird markets in the USA. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(4), 513–520. Background Wild birds are the natural hosts for influenza A viruses (IAVs) and provide a niche for the maintenance of this virus. Objectives This study was undertaken to analyze nucleotide sequences of the matrix (M) gene of AIVs isolated from wild birds and live bird markets (LBMs) to index the changes occurring in this gene. Methods M‐gene of 229 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates obtained from wild birds and LBMs was amplified and sequenced. Full‐length sequences (∼900 nt.) thus obtained were analyzed to identify changes that may be associated with resistance to adamantanes. Phylogenetic analysis of all sequences was performed using clustalw, and evolutionary distances were calculated by maximum composite likelihood method using mega (ver. 5.0) software. Results Twenty‐seven different viral subtypes were represented with H3N8 being the most dominant subtype in wild birds and H7N2 being the predominant subtype among isolates from LBMs. Phylogenetic analysis of the M‐gene showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity with US isolates of AIVs but not with those of Asian or European lineages. While none of the isolates from wild birds had any antiviral resistance–associated mutations, 17 LBM isolates carried polymorphisms known to cause reduced susceptibility to antiviral drugs (adamantanes). Of these 17 isolates, 16 had S31N change and one isolate had V27A mutation. Conclusions These results indicate independent evolution of M‐gene in the absence of any antiviral drugs leading to mutations causing resistance indicating the need for continued active surveillance of AIVs.","Chander, Yogesh; Jindal, Naresh; Sreevatsan, Srinand; Stallknecht, David E.; Goyal, Sagar M.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,121,1

Immunoproteasomes are specialized types of proteasomes involved in shaping adaptive immune responses, but their role in innate immune signaling is still elusive. Here, we analyzed immunoproteasome function for polarization of alveolar macrophages, highly specialized tissue macrophages of the alveolar lung surface. Classical activation (M1 polarization) of primary alveolar macrophages by LPS/IFNγ transcriptionally induced all three immunoproteasome subunits, low molecular mass protein 2 (LMP2), LMP7 and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1, which was accompanied by increased immunoproteasome activity in M1 cells. Deficiency of LMP7 had no effect on the LPS/IFNγ-triggered M1 profile indicating that immunoproteasome function is dispensable for classical alveolar macrophage activation. In contrast, IL-4 triggered alternative (M2) activation of primary alveolar macrophages was accompanied by a transcriptionally independent amplified expression of LMP2 and LMP7 and an increase in immunoproteasome activity. Alveolar macrophages from LMP7 knockout mice disclosed a distorted M2 profile upon IL-4 stimulation as characterized by increased M2 marker gene expression and CCL17 cytokine release. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of IL-4-responsive genes and of genes involved in cellular response to defense, wounding and inflammation in LMP7-deficient alveolar macrophages indicating a distinct M2 inflammation resolving phenotype. Moreover, augmented M2 polarization was accompanied by amplified AKT/STAT6 activation and increased RNA and protein expression of the M2 master transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 in LMP7(−/−) alveolar macrophages. IL-13 stimulation of LMP7-deficient macrophages induced a similar M2-skewed profile indicative for augmented signaling via the IL-4 receptor α (IL4Rα). IL4Rα expression was generally elevated only on protein but not RNA level in LMP7(−/−) alveolar macrophages. Importantly, specific catalytic inhibition with an LMP7-specific proteasome inhibitor confirmed augmented IL-4-mediated M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages. Our results thus suggest a novel role of immunoproteasome function for regulating alternative activation of macrophages by limiting IL4Rα expression and signaling.","Chen, S; Kammerl, I E; Vosyka, O; Baumann, T; Yu, Y; Wu, Y; Irmler, M; Overkleeft, H S; Beckers, J; Eickelberg, O; Meiners, S; Stoeger, T",Cell Death Differ,121,8

The immunosuppressive cytokine Interleukin (IL)-10 counteracts hyperactive immune responses and critically controls immune homeostasis in infectious and autoimmune disorders. In order to investigate the effect of signaling via Interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) in infectious neurological diseases, TMEV-infected SJL mice were treated with IL-10R blocking antibody (Ab) in the acute and chronic phase of the disease. The findings demonstrate that (i) Ab-mediated IL-10 neutralization leads to progressive colitis with a reduction in Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and increased numbers of CD8(+)CD44(+) memory T cells as well as activated CD4(+)CD69(+) and CD8(+)CD69(+) T cells in uninfected mice. (ii) Concurrent acute TMEV-infection worsened enteric disease-mediated by IL-10R neutralization. Virus-triggered effects were associated with an enhanced activation of CD4(+) T helper cells and CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes and augmented cytokine expression. By contrast, (iii) IL-10R neutralization during chronic TMEV-infection was not associated with enhanced peripheral immunopathology but an increased CD3(+) T cell influx in the spinal cord. IL-10R neutralization causes a breakdown in peripheral immune tolerance in genetically predisposed mice, which leads to immune-mediated colitis, resembling inflammatory bowel disease. Hyperactive immune state following IL-10R blockade is enhanced by central nervous system-restricted viral infection in a disease phase-dependent manner.","Uhde, Ann-Kathrin; Herder, Vanessa; Akram Khan, Muhammad; Ciurkiewicz, Malgorzata; Schaudien, Dirk; Teich, René; Floess, Stefan; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Huehn, Jochen; Beineke, Andreas",PLoS One,121,1

However, the practical uses are limited due to high costs and the risk of anti-drug antibody responses. Attempts to develop anti-TNF-α vaccines have generated encouraging data in animal models, however, data from clinical trials have not met expectations. In present study, we designed a TNF-α epitope-scaffold immunogen DTNF7 using the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin, named DTT as a scaffold. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the grafted TNF-α epitope is entirely surface-exposed and presented in a native-like conformation while the rigid helical structure of DTT is minimally perturbed, thereby rendering the immunogen highly stable. Immunization of mice with alum formulated DTNF7 induced humoral responses against native TNF-α, and the antibody titer was sustained for more than 6 months, which supports a role of the universal CD4 T cell epitopes of DTT in breaking self-immune tolerance. In a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis, DTNF7-alum vaccination markedly delayed the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, and reduced incidence as well as clinical score. DTT is presumed safe as an epitope carrier because a catalytic inactive mutant of diphtheria toxin, CRM197 has good clinical safety records as an active vaccine component. Taken all together, we show that DTT-based epitope vaccine is a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.","Zhang, Li; Wang, Jin; Xu, Aizhang; Zhong, Conghao; Lu, Wuguang; Deng, Li; Li, Rongxiu",PLoS One,121,1

Endogenous viruses integrate into host genomes and can recombine with exogenous avian leukosis virus (ALV). In this study, we analyzed the interaction of endogenous retrovirus 21 (ev21) with the ALV-J in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken. Two ALV-J strains M180 and K243 were isolated from late-feathering and fast-feathering Chinese yellow chicken flocks, respectively. The env gene of the two strains showed 94.2–94.8% nucleotide identity with reference ALV-J strains. Compared with the env gene and the LTR of ev21 and M180, the nucleotide identity of LTR was 69.7% and env gene was 58.4%, respectively, especially the amino acid identity of env gene as low as 14.2%. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the env gene and the 3′LTR showed that M180 was closely related to ALV-J, and was located in a distinct group with ev21 in the phylogenetic tree. Using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), we next demonstrate that the envelope protein of ev21 does not interact with the M180 envelope protein. We further show that the envelope protein of ev21 cannot activate ALV-J LTR promoter activity using luciferase-reporter assays. qPCR and western blot analysis revealed that envelope protein of endogenous ev21 can facilitate the expression of PKR at 6h post ALV-J infection (hpi) and facilitate the expression of ISG12 and CH25H at 24 hpi. However, the expression of the env gene of M180 strain was not significantly at 6 and 24 hpi. We conclude that there is no evidence of recombination between endogenous retrovirus ev21 and ALV-J strain M180 in late-feathering Chinese yellow chicken, and envelope protein of ev21 can affect the expression of host ISGs, but appears not to influence the replication of ALV-J strain M180. This is the first report of interaction among the endogenous retrovirus ev21, ALV-J and the late-feathering chicken.","Feng, Min; Tan, Yan; Dai, Manman; Li, Yuanfang; Xie, Tingting; Li, Hongmei; Shi, Meiqing; Zhang, Xiquan",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,121,8

RSV G protein encodes a central conserved region (CCR) containing a CX3C motif that functions as a fractalkine mimic. Disruption of the CX3C motif (a.a. 182–186) located in the CCR of the G protein has been shown to affect G protein function in vitro and the severity of RSV disease pathogenesis in vivo. We show that infection of polarized Calu3 respiratory cells with recombinant RSV having point mutations in Cys173 and 176 (C173/176S) (rA2-GC12), or Cys186 (C186S) (rA2-GC4) is associated with a decline in the integrity of polarized Calu-3 cultures and decreased virus production. This is accompanied with downregulation of miRNAs let-7f and miR-24 and upregulation of interferon lambda (IFNλ), a primary antiviral cytokine for RSV in rA2-GC12/rA2-GC4 infected cells. These results suggest that residues in the cysteine noose region of RSV G protein can modulate IFN λ expression accompanied by downregulation of miRNAs, and are important for RSV G protein function and targeting.","Bakre, Abhijeet A.; Harcourt, Jennifer L.; Haynes, Lia M.; Anderson, Larry J.; Tripp, Ralph A.",Vaccines (Basel),121,28

A major limitation to current vaccinations and therapies against influenza virus is pathogenic diversity generated by shift and drift. A simple, cost-effective passive immunization strategy via in vivo production of cross-protective antibody molecules may augment existing vaccines and antiviral drugs in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. We engineered synthetic plasmid DNA to encode two novel and broadly cross-protective monoclonal antibodies targeting influenza A and B. We utilized enhanced in vivo delivery of these plasmid DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) constructs and show that this strategy induces robust levels of functional antibodies directed against influenza A and B viruses in mouse sera. Mice receiving a single inoculation with anti-influenza A DMAb survive lethal Group 1 H1 and Group 2 H3 influenza A challenges, while inoculation with anti-influenza B DMAb yields protection against lethal Victoria and Yamagata lineage influenza B morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, these two DMAbs can be delivered coordinately resulting in exceptionally broad protection against both influenza A and B. We demonstrate this protection is similar to that achieved by conventional protein antibody delivery. DMAbs warrant further investigation as a novel immune therapy platform with distinct advantages for sustained immunoprophylaxis against influenza.","Elliott, Sarah T.

To induce protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—a highly prevalent childhood pathogen without a licensed vaccine—we previously engineered a pre-fusion-stabilized trimeric RSV F (pre-F) “DS-Cav1” immunogen, which induced high titer RSV-neutralizing antibodies, in mice and non-human primates, when formulated with adjuvants Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC), respectively. To assess the impact of different adjuvants, here we formulated RSV F DS-Cav1 with multiple adjuvants and assessed immune responses. Very high RSV-neutralizing antibody responses (19,006 EC(50)) were observed in naïve mice immunized with 2 doses of DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Sigma adjuvant system (SAS), an oil-in-water adjuvant, plus Carbopol; high responses (3658–7108) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum, SAS alone, Adjuplex, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC); and moderate responses (1251–2129) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with the TLR4 agonist MPLA, Alum plus MPLA or AddaVax. In contrast, DS-Cav1 without adjuvant induced low-level responses (6). A balanced IgG1 and IgG2a (Th2/Th1) immune response was elicited in most of the high to very high response groups (all but Alum and Adjuplex). We also tested the immune response induced by DS-Cav1 in elderly mice with pre-existing DS-Cav1 immunity; we observed that DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol boosted the response 2-3-fold, whereas DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with alum boosted the response 5-fold. Finally, we tested whether a mixture of ISA 71 VG and Carbopol would enhanced the antibody response in DS-Cav1 immunized calves. While pre-F-stabilized bovine RSV F induced very high titers in mice when adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol, the addition of Carbopol to ISA 71 VG did not enhance immune responses in calves. The vaccine response to pre-F-stabilized RSV F is augmented by adjuvant, but the degree of adjuvant-induced enhancement appears to be both context-dependent and species-specific.","Sastry, Mallika; Zhang, Baoshan; Chen, Man; Joyce, M.

Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses contribute to virus elimination; however, to date, HLA class I allele-restricted HTNV glycoprotein (GP) epitopes recognized by CTLs have not been reported, limiting our understanding of CTL responses against HTNV infection in humans. In this study, 34 HTNV GP nine-mer epitopes that may bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules were predicted using the BIMAS and SYFPEITHI database. Seven of the epitopes were demonstrated to bind to HLA-A*0201 molecules with high affinity via the T2 cell binding assay and were successfully used to synthesize peptide/HLA-A*0201 tetramers. The results of tetramer staining showed that the frequencies of each epitope-specific CTL were higher in patients with milder HFRS, which indicated that the epitopes may induce protective CTL responses after HTNV infection. IFN-γ-enzyme-linked immunospot analysis further confirmed the immunoreactivity of epitopes by eliciting epitope-specific IFN-γ-producing CTL responses. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant inhibition of HTNV replication characterized by lower levels of antigens and RNA loads was observed in major target organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) of HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice pre-vaccinated with nonapeptides VV9 (aa8–aa16, VMASLVWPV), SL9 (aa996–aa1004, SLTECPTFL) and LL9 (aa358–aa366, LIWTGMIDL). Importantly, LL9 exhibited the best ability to induce protective CTL responses and showed a prominent effect on the kidneys, potentially preventing kidney injury after HTNV infection. Taken together, our results highlight that HTNV GP-derived HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes could elicit protective CTL responses against the virus, and that epitope LL9 functions as an immunodominant protective epitope that may advance the design of safe and effective CTL-based HTNV peptide vaccines for humans.","Tang, Kang; Cheng, Linfeng; Zhang, Chunmei; Zhang, Yusi; Zheng, Xuyang; Zhang, Yun; Zhuang, Ran; Jin, Boquan; Zhang, Fanglin; Ma, Ying",Front Immunol,121,8

Network and KEGG pathway analyses revealed several regulated proteins associated with the NF-κB signaling pathway. Further validation was performed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assay, which demonstrated that different CDV strains induced NF-κB P65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Moreover, the results provided interesting information that some identified DEPs possibly associated with the pathogenesis and the immune response upon CDV infection.

However, the relative contribution of memory CD8 T cells in providing protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is currently unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we utilized a prime-boost immunization approach to induce robust memory CD8 T cell responses in the absence of RSV-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies. Unexpectedly, RSV infection of mice with pre-existing CD8 T cell memory led to exacerbated weight loss, pulmonary disease, and lethal immunopathology. The exacerbated disease in immunized mice was not epitope-dependent and occurred despite a significant reduction in RSV viral titers. In addition, the lethal immunopathology was unique to the context of an RSV infection as mice were protected from a normally lethal challenge with a recombinant influenza virus expressing an RSV epitope. Memory CD8 T cells rapidly produced IFN-γ following RSV infection resulting in elevated protein levels in the lung and periphery. Neutralization of IFN-γ in the respiratory tract reduced morbidity and prevented mortality. These results demonstrate that in contrast to other respiratory viruses, RSV-specific memory CD8 T cells can induce lethal immunopathology despite mediating enhanced viral clearance.","Schmidt, Megan E.; Knudson, Cory J.; Hartwig, Stacey M.; Pewe, Lecia L.; Meyerholz, David K.; Langlois, Ryan A.; Harty, John T.; Varga, Steven M.",PLoS Pathog,121,28

A HuNoV replicon system has been widely applied to the evaluation of antiviral compounds and has thus accelerated the process of drug discovery against HuNoV infection. Rupintrivir, an irreversible inhibitor of the human rhinovirus 3C protease, has been reported to inhibit the replication of the Norwalk virus replicon via the inhibition of the norovirus protease. Here we report, for the first time, the generation of rupintrivir-resistant human Norwalk virus replicon cells in vitro. Sequence analysis revealed that these replicon cells contained amino acid substitutions of alanine 105 to valine (A105V) and isoleucine 109 to valine (I109V) in the viral protease NS6. The application of a cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for protease activity demonstrated that these substitutions were involved in the enhanced resistance to rupintrivir. Furthermore, we validated the effect of these mutations using reverse genetics in murine norovirus (MNV), demonstrating that a recombinant MNV strain with a single I109V substitution in the protease also showed reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir. In summary, using a combination of different approaches, we have demonstrated that, under the correct conditions, mutations in the norovirus protease that lead to the generation of resistant mutants can rapidly occur.","Kitano, Mitsutaka; Hosmillo, Myra; Emmott, Edward; Lu, Jia; Goodfellow, Ian",Antimicrob Agents Chemother,121,28

EBV also infects epithelial cells, predominantly resulting in a lytic infection, which may contribute to EBV transmission from saliva. In the nasopharynx, EBV infection can lead to the clonal expansion of a latently infected cell and the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The mechanisms governing EBV pathogenesis in nasopharyngeal epithelium are largely unknown. An advanced understanding would depend on a physiologically relevant culture model of polarized airway epithelium. The recent application of the organotypic raft culture in keratinocytes has demonstrated great promise for the use of polarized cultures in the study of EBV permissive replication. In this study, the adaptation of an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method using transwell membranes was explored in an EBV-infected NPC cell line. In the EBV-infected NPC HK1 cell line, ALI culture resulted in the completion of EBV reactivation, with global induction of the lytic cascade, replication of EBV genomes, and production of infectious progeny virus. We propose that the ALI culture method can be widely adopted as a physiologically relevant model to study EBV pathogenesis in polarized nasal epithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Lifting adherent cells to the air-liquid interface (ALI) is a method conventionally used to culture airway epithelial cells into polarized apical and basolateral surfaces. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from monolayer epithelial cultures is sometimes abortive, which may be attributed to the lack of authentic reactivation triggers that occur in stratified epithelium in vivo. In the present work, the ALI culture method was applied to study EBV reactivation in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. The ALI culture of an EBV-infected cell line yielded high titers and can be dissected by a variety of molecular virology assays that measure induction of the EBV lytic cascade and EBV genome replication and assembly. EBV infection of polarized cultures of primary epithelial cells can be challenging and can have variable efficiencies. However, the use of the ALI method with established EBV-infected cell lines offers a readily available and reproducible approach for the study of EBV permissive replication in polarized epithelia.","Caves, Elizabeth A.; Cook, Sarah A.; Lee, Nara; Stoltz, Donna; Watkins, Simon; Shair, Kathy H.

Long-term, robust growth of human DAECs was achieved using co-culture with feeder cells and supplementation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor Y27632, and the Notch pathway inhibitor dibenzazepine (DBZ). Removal of feeders and priming with DBZ and a cocktail of lung maturation factors prevented the spontaneous differentiation into airway club cells and instead induced differentiation to alveolar epithelial cells.

Thus, in the current study we examined the effect of normoxic hypercapnia (20% CO(2) for 24 h) vs normocapnia (5% CO(2)), on global gene expression in differentiated normal human airway epithelial cells. Gene expression was assessed on Affymetrix microarrays, and subjected to gene ontology analysis for biological process and cluster-network representation. We found that hypercapnia downregulated the expression of 183 genes and upregulated 126. Among these, major gene clusters linked to immune responses and nucleosome assembly were largely downregulated, while lipid metabolism genes were largely upregulated. The overwhelming majority of these genes were not previously known to be regulated by CO(2).

The VAA protein previously identified in flounder is associated with a role in immune protection within these fish. In the present study, a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the VAA gene of V. anguillarum was constructed and its potential as a DNA vaccine, to prevent the infection of V. anguillarum in flounder fish, investigated. We verified the expression of the VAA protein both in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in flounder fish. The protective effects of pcDNA3.1-VAA (pVAA) were analyzed by determination of the percentage of sIgM(+), CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), CD8β(+) lymphocytes, and the production of VAA-specific antibodies in flounder following their immunization with the DNA vaccine. Histopathological changes in immune related tissues, bacterial load, and relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge with V. anguillarum, were all investigated to assess the efficacy of the pVAA DNA vaccine candidate. Fish intramuscularly immunized with pVAA showed a significant increase in CD4-1(+), CD4-2(+), and CD8β(+) T lymphocytes at days 9, 11, and 14 post-vaccination, reaching peak T-cell levels at days 11 or 14 post-immunization. The percentage of sIgM(+) lymphocytes reached peak levels at weeks 4–5 post-immunization. Specific anti-V. anguillarum or anti-rVAA antibodies were induced in inoculated fish at days 28–35 post-immunization. The liver of vaccinated flounder exhibited only slight histopathological changes compared with a significant pathology observed in control immunized fish. Additionally, a lower bacterial burden in the liver, spleen, and kidney were observed in pVAA protected fish in response to bacterial challenge, compared with pcDNA3.1 vector control injected fish. Moreover, the pVAA vaccine confers a relative percentage survival of 50.00% following V. anguillarum infection. In summary, this is the first study indicating an initial induction of the T lymphocyte response, followed by B lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies as a result of DNA immunization of flounder. This signifies the important potential of pVAA as a DNA vaccine candidate for the control of V. anguillarum infection.","Xing, Jing; Xu, Hongsen; Tang, Xiaoqian; Sheng, Xiuzhen; Zhan, Wenbin",Front Immunol,121,1

In this study, we show that extracts from these herbs have antiviral effects against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vitro cell cultures and an in vivo mouse model. Treatment of HEp2 cells and A549 cells with a non-cytotoxic concentration of Plantago asiatica or Clerodendrum trichotomum extract significantly reduced RSV replication, RSV-induced cell death, RSV gene transcription, RSV protein synthesis, and also blocked syncytia formation. Interestingly, oral inoculation with each herb extract significantly improved viral clearance in the lungs of BALB/c mice. Based on reported information and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, the phenolic glycoside acteoside was identified as an active chemical component of both herb extracts. An effective dose of acteoside exhibited similar antiviral effects as each herb extract against RSV in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that extracts of Plantago asiatica and Clerodendrum trichotomum could provide a potent natural source of an antiviral drug candidate against RSV infection.","Chathuranga, Kiramage; Kim, Myun Soo; Lee, Hyun-Cheol; Kim, Tae-Hwan; Kim, Jae-Hoon; Gayan Chathuranga, W.

4040,4040,4040,A novel method to rescue and culture duck Astrovirus type 1 in vitro,11.581219,7.8350096,2019-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Reverse genetics systems enable the manipulation of viral genomes and therefore serve as robust reverse genetic tools to study RNA viruses. A DNA-launched rescue system initiates the transcription of viral genomic cDNA from eukaryotic promoter in transfected cells, generating homogenous RNA transcripts in vitro and thus enhancing virus rescue efficiency. As one of the hazardous pathogens to ducklings, the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of duck astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1) is limited. The construction of a DNA-launched rescue system can help to accelerate the study of the virus pathogenesis. However, there is no report of such a system for DAstV-1. METHODS: In this study, a DNA-launched infectious clone of DAstV-1 was constructed from a cDNA plasmid, which contains a viral cDNA sequence flanked by hammerhead ribozyme (HamRz) and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HdvRz) sequence at both terminals of the viral genome. A silent nucleotide mutation creating a Bgl II site in the ORF2 gene was made to distinguish the rescued virus (rDAstV-1) from the parental virus (pDAstV-1). Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blot were conducted for rescued virus identification in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells pre-treated with trypsin. The growth characteristics of rDAstV-1 and pDAstV-1 in DEF cells and the tissue tropism in 2-day-old ducklings of rDAstV-1 and pDAstV-1 were determined. RESULTS: The infectious DAstV-1 was successfully rescued from baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and could propagate in DEF cells pre-treated with 1 μg/ml trypsin. Upon infection of DEF cells pre-treated with trypsin, DAstV-1 mRNA copies were identified after serial passaging, and the result showed that rDAstV-1 and pDAstV-1 shared similar replication kinetics. Animal experiment showed that the rDAstV-1 had an extensive tissue tropism, and the virus was capable of invading both the central and the peripheral immune organs in infected ducklings. CONCLUSIONS: An improved DNA-launched reverse genetics system for DAstV-1 was firstly constructed. Infectious virus recovered from BHK-21 cells could propagate in DEF cells pre-treated with trypsin. This is the first report of the successful in vitro cultivation of DAstV-1. We believe this valuable experimental system will contribute to the further study of DAstV-1 genome function and pathogenesis.","Zhang, Ruihua; Lan, Jingjing; Li, Haie; Chen, Junhao; Yang, Yupeng; Lin, Shaoli; Xie, Zhijing; Jiang, Shijin",Virol J,121,1

However, previous reports suggest a reduced efficacy of ethanol disinfection against pathogens in mucus. We aimed to elucidate the situations and mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of EBDs against IAV in infectious mucus. We evaluated IAV inactivation and ethanol concentration change using IAV-infected patients’ mucus (sputum). Additionally, AHR and AHW effectiveness against infectious mucus adhering to the hands and fingers was evaluated in 10 volunteers. Our clinical study showed that EBD effectiveness against IAV in mucus was extremely reduced compared to IAV in saline. IAV in mucus remained active despite 120 s of AHR; however, IAV in saline was completely inactivated within 30 s. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the time required for the ethanol concentration to reach an IAV inactivation level and thus for EBDs to completely inactivate IAV was approximately eight times longer in mucus than in saline. On the other hand, AHR inactivated IAV in mucus within 30 s when the mucus dried completely because the hydrogel characteristics were lost. Additionally, AHW rapidly inactivated IAV. Until infectious mucus has completely dried, infectious IAV can remain on the hands and fingers, even after appropriate AHR using EBD, thereby increasing the risk of IAV transmission. We clarified the ineffectiveness of EBD use against IAV in infectious mucus. IMPORTANCE Antiseptic hand rubbing (AHR) and antiseptic hand washing (AHW) are important to prevent the spread of influenza A virus (IAV). This study elucidated the situations/mechanisms underlying the reduced efficacy of AHR against infectious mucus derived from IAV-infected individuals and indicated the weaknesses of the current hand hygiene regimens. Due to the low rate of diffusion/convection because of the physical properties of mucus as a hydrogel, the efficacy of AHR using ethanol-based disinfectant against mucus is greatly reduced until infectious mucus adhering to the hands/fingers has completely dried. If there is insufficient time before treating the next patient (i.e., if the infectious mucus is not completely dry), medical staff should be aware that effectiveness of AHR is reduced. Since AHW is effective against both dry and nondry infectious mucus, AHW should be adopted to compensate for these weaknesses of AHR.","Hirose, Ryohei; Nakaya, Takaaki; Naito, Yuji; Daidoji, Tomo; Bandou, Risa; Inoue, Ken; Dohi, Osamu; Yoshida, Naohisa; Konishi, Hideyuki; Itoh, Yoshito",mSphere,121,28

HIV relies on multiple regulatory proteins to modify the host cell to promote replication in infected T cells, and these regulatory proteins can have subtle phenotypic differences between subtypes. One of these proteins, HIV-1 Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat), is capable of RNA interference (RNAi) Silencing Suppressor (RSS) activity and induction of cell death in T cells. However, the subtype-specific RSS activity and induction of cell death have not been explored. We investigated the ability of Tat subtypes and variants to induce RSS activity and cell death. TatB, from HIV-1 subtype B, was found to be a potent RSS activator by 40% whereas TatC, from HIV-1 subtype C, showed 15% RSS activity while subtype TatC variants exhibited varying levels. A high level of cell death (50–53%) was induced by subtype TatB when compared to subtype TatC (25–28%) and varying levels were observed with subtype TatC variants. These differential activities could be due to variations in the functional domains of Tat. These observations further our understanding of subtype-specific augmentation of Tat in HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis.","Ronsard, Larance; S.

The current study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of BRSV in cattle in the Nineveh Province, Iraq. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 2017 and September 2018, 450 serum samples were collected from non-vaccinated cattle of different ages and breeds for BRSV testing. The epidemiological information of the animals was recorded. The prevalence of the disease was determined using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: The prevalence of BRSV was 83.11%, and it was significantly (p<0.05) higher in cattle aged greater than 7 months-1.5 years than in older animals; in imported cattle than in Native animals; and in animals originating from large herds (100 animals) than in those from smaller herds (40 animals). There was no significant difference between BRSV prevalence in male and female animals. When samples from different regions of the Nineveh Governorate were compared, the northern region was associated with the highest prevalence of the disease. Samples harvested in the winter displayed the highest BRSV titer, compared to those collected during the other seasons. CONCLUSION: BRSV is prevalent in cattle from the Nineveh Governorate. Risk factors such as animal age, origin, herd size, and the herd’s geographical location are associated with an increased prevalence of the disease in this region. Routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the prevalence of BRSV.","Hussain, Khder Jassiem; Al-Farwachi, Maab Ibrahim; Hassan, Sadam Dhahir",Vet World,121,28

Early diagnosis of VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. Developing a noninvasive and highly accurate diagnostic method is important. The invention of electronic sensors has been applied to analyze the volatile organic compounds in breath to detect VAP using a machine learning technique. However, the process of building an algorithm is usually unclear and prevents physicians from applying the artificial intelligence technique in clinical practice. Clear processes of model building and assessing accuracy are warranted. The objective of this study was to develop a breath test for VAP with a standardized protocol for a machine learning technique. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study. This study enrolled subjects in an intensive care unit of a hospital in southern Taiwan from February 2017 to June 2019. We recruited patients with VAP as the case group and ventilated patients without pneumonia as the control group. We collected exhaled breath and analyzed the electric resistance changes of 32 sensor arrays of an electronic nose. We split the data into a set for training algorithms and a set for testing. We applied eight machine learning algorithms to build prediction models, improving model performance and providing an estimated diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 33 cases and 26 controls were used in the final analysis. Using eight machine learning algorithms, the mean accuracy in the testing set was 0.81 ± 0.04, the sensitivity was 0.79 ± 0.08, the specificity was 0.83 ± 0.00, the positive predictive value was 0.85 ± 0.02, the negative predictive value was 0.77 ± 0.06, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves was 0.85 ± 0.04. The mean kappa value in the testing set was 0.62 ± 0.08, which suggested good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: There was good accuracy in detecting VAP by sensor array and machine learning techniques. Artificial intelligence has the potential to assist the physician in making a clinical diagnosis.

Identifying who needs antibiotics is challenging; microbiological confirmation and clinical scores are used but have limitations. In a cross-sectional study nested within a randomized controlled trial, we estimated the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients presenting to primary care with a sore throat and fever in northern Thailand. We then evaluated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical scores (Centor and FeverPAIN) to identify the presence of GAS. One hundred sixty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 35 (20.7%) had β-hemolytic Streptococci (BHS) isolated from throat swab culture, and 11 (6.5%) had GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin G. The median CRP of those without BHS isolation was 10 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] ≤ 8–18), compared with 18 mg/L (IQR 9–71, P = 0.0302) for those with GAS and 14 mg/L (IQR ≤ 8–38, P = 0.0516) for those with any BHS isolated. However, there were no significant relationships between CRP > 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor ≥ 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN ≥ 4 (P = 1.000), and the diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. Identifying who requires antibiotics for pharyngitis remains challenging and necessitates further larger studies. C-reactive protein testing alone, although imperfect, can reduce prescribing compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through clinical scoring may be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.","Greer, Rachel; Althaus, Thomas; Ling, Clare; Intralawan, Daranee; Nedsuwan, Supalert; Thaipadungpanit, Janjira; Wangrangsimakul, Tri; Butler, Christopher; Day, Nicolas; Lubell, Yoel",Am J Trop Med Hyg,121,1

However, no systematic approach has been developed for the study of inflammatory lung diseases with often complex and highly heterogeneous disease etiologies. We have devised an internally standardized flow cytometry approach that can identify parallel inflammatory alveolar macrophage phenotypes in both the mouse and human lungs. In mice, lung innate immune cell alterations during endotoxin challenge, influenza virus infection, and in two genetic models of chronic obstructive lung disease could be segregated based on the presence or absence of CD11b alveolar macrophage upregulation and lung eosinophilia. Additionally, heightened alveolar macrophage CD11b expression was a novel feature of acute lung exacerbations in the SHIP-1(−/−) model of chronic obstructive lung disease, and anti-CD11b antibody administration selectively blocked inflammatory CD11b(pos) but not homeostatic CD11b(neg) alveolar macrophages in vivo. The identification of analogous profiles in respiratory disease patients highlights this approach as a translational avenue for lung disease endotyping and suggests that heterogeneous innate immune cell phenotypes are an underappreciated component of the human lung disease microenvironment.

This resitance can be expressed both non-specifically, and specifically in indiction, regulation and amplification of humoral and cell mediated immune responses to viruses. These lead to the extrinsic effect of macrophages on other virus-infected cells or free virus, and the intrinsic effect on viruses within macrophages. While these interactions usually appear to be protective, immunopathologic consequences as well as macrophage dysfunctions have also been noted. The outcome of any given interaction (viral elimination, peristance, latency or transformation) varies markedly with the type of macrophage.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding PAP-Fn or PAP-Sb on performance, carcass characteristics, and ruminal fermentation variables of feedlot steers. In Exp. 1, during 2 consecutive years, 226 or 192 Angus and Angus crossbred steers were fed a high-grain diet containing either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn, or both. When measured on a BW basis, steers fed only PAP-Sb had a greater G:F (P < 0.05) than those fed no PAP. Nevertheless, when both PAP were fed, feed efficiency was similar (P > 0.10) to steers fed no PAP or only PAP-Sb. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased (P < 0.05) dressing percentage. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased severity of liver abscess (P < 0.05). No differences (P > 0.10) were observed in any other carcass characteristics. In Exp. 2, sixteen ruminally cannulated Angus crossbred steers (BW = 665 ± 86 kg) were fed a high-grain diet containing either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn, or both. Feeding only PAP-Fn or PAP-Sb for 19 d decreased (P < 0.05) ruminal counts of S. bovis when compared with steers fed both or no PAP. The ruminal counts of F. necrophorum in steers fed PAP-Fn alone or in combination with PAP-Sb were decreased by 98% (P < 0.05) after 19 d, when compared with the counts in control steers. Mean daily ruminal pH was greater (P < 0.05) in steers fed both PAP when compared with feeding either or no PAP.

Facilities for oxygen therapy are crucial, and the choice between oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and a centralized system depends on the setting. For use in mechanical ventilators, a centralized piped system is preferred. Facilities for proper hand hygiene are essential. Alcohol-based solutions are preferred, except in the context of Ebola virus disease (chloride-based solutions) and Clostridium difficile infection (soap and water).

Caring for patients with highly contagious infectious diseases requires access to personal protective equipment. Basic ICU equipment should include vital signs monitors and mechanical ventilators, which should also deliver noninvasive ventilator modes. We suggest that ICUs providing invasive ventilatory support have the ability to measure end-tidal carbon dioxide and if possible can perform blood gas analysis. We recommend availability of glucometers and capabilities for measuring blood lactate. We suggest implementation of bedside ultrasound as diagnostic tool.

In order to investigate the origin and function of this region and its occurrence in nature, the cDNA sequences of the 3' non-coding regions of three additional strains of IBV, Gray, Arkansas (Ark) 99 and Holland (Holl) 52, were determined and compared to the sequences of the Beaudette, KB8523 and Mass41 strains. Not only was this U-rich sequence absent from the 3' non-coding region of the Mass41 strain, it was also highly variable, especially in comparison to the highly conserved 3' non coding region downstream of this sequence. Computer analyses of the sequences adjacent to this hypervariable region (HVR) showed that the 3' end of the IBV genome was highly conserved downstream of this region, with 94.3 to 97.8% similarity. However, the similarities for the HVR ranged from 53.2% between Ho1152 and Ark99, to 92.8% between Beaudette and Gray. The flanking sequences were not only conserved but these sequences upstream and downstream of the HVR also formed mirrored images.","Williams, A.K.; Wang, L.; Sneed, L.W.; Collisson, E.W.",Virus Res,121,28

On presentation, all cats were asymptomatic; free of opportunistic infections; and had normal complete blood counts, bone marrow morphologies, marrow progenitor frequencies, and progenitor in vitro growth characteristics. During study, 2 cats remained healthy, 2 cats showed mild clinical signs, and 1 cat developed a malignant neoplasm (ie, bronchiolar‐alveolar adenocarcinoma). Although persistent hematologic abnormalities were not observed, intermittent peripheral leukopenias were common. In 3 of 5 FlV‐seropositive cats, lymphopenia (< 1,500 lymphs/μL; normal reference range, 1,500 to 7,000 lymphs/μL) was a frequent finding and the absolute lymphocyte counts had a tendency to progressively decline. One of the other 2 cats had consistently low to low‐normal absolute neutrophil counts (1,300 to 4,800 segs/μL; mean, 2,730 segs/μL; normal reference range, 2,500 to 12,500 segs/μL), and the remaining cat had consistently normal leukograms, except for a transient period (ie, 11 months) of benign lymphocytosis (7,200 to 13,430 lymphs/μL) early in the study. Periodic examinations of bone marrow aspirates revealed normal to slightly depressed myeloid‐to‐erythroid ratios with normal cellular morphology and maturation. Bone marrow abnormalities observed late in the study included mild dysmor‐phic changes (ie, megaloblastic features) in 2 cats, and a significant decrease (60% of controls, P < .001) in the frequencies of burst‐forming units erythroid (BFU‐E) in marrow cultures of FIV‐seropositive cats compared with uninfected control cats. Serum biochemical profiles were unremarkable throughout the study, with the exception of hyperglobulinemia (ie, polyclonal gammopathy) in 2 of 5 cats. Peripheral blood and bone marrow findings were of no apparent prognostic value. These results confirm the long latency between natural FIV infection and the development of life‐threatening clinical disease. Chronic FIV infection, like infection with human immunodeficiency virus, can be associated with derangements in peripheral blood cell counts, as well as pertubations in marrow cell morphologies and hematopoietic progenitor frequencies before the terminal symptomatic stages of retroviral disease, when persistent cytopenias are prominent.","Shelton, Grady H.; Linenberger, Michael L.; Persik, Monica T.; Abkowitz, Janis L.",J Vet Intern Med,121,22

Interferon‐beta (IFN‐β), an endogenous cytokine and a key anti‐inflammatory agent, contributes toward obviating deleterious stroke outcomes. Therefore, exploring the role of IFN‐β may be a promising alternative approach for stroke intervention in the future.

To ensure high quality of the trial intervention as well as of patient care, we have developed a multilingual web-based training program to train relevant staff and test their competence. As we enter an under-explored area of e-learning, we have conducted a pilot study on the first of the five modules comprising the web-based training program to test the feasibility of developing such a program for an international trial with limited resources. METHODS: The module in this study focuses on the principles and practice of NIRS monitoring. The pedagogical idea was to integrate training and certification. One-hundred doctors and nurses from five Neonatal Intensive Care Units across China, Spain and Denmark were invited to participate in the pilot study. Upon completion of the NIRS module, participants were invited to evaluate their experience by completing an online survey. Data from closed-ended questions were analysed using descriptive statistics while data from open-ended questions underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 81 of 100 invited staff members entered the training module and completed the online survey. The median time and the number of questions to pass the module was 15 minutes and seven questions, respectively. Most staff found the academic level of the learning material and quiz appropriate (85% and 93% of all staff members, respectively), as well as agreeing that the module was relevant to prepare them to ‘use the NIRS device’ (90%). Thematic analysis revealed issues such as a discrepancy between learning material and quiz questions, lack of clarity, and technical issues. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence of the feasibility of developing a multilingual web-based training program for an international trial, despite challenges such as low budget, language barriers and possibly differences in the clinical training of staff. Exploring the integration of training and certification for international trials, the positive results of this study motivate further developments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03770741.

Recent trauma society guidelines suggesting that all children over 15 years old should receive thromboprophylaxis may result in overtreatment. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a previously published VTE prediction algorithm and compare it to current recommendations. METHODS: Two institutional trauma registries were queried for all pediatric (age < 18 years) patients admitted from 2007 to 2018. Clinical data were applied to the algorithm and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated to test algorithm efficacy. RESULTS: A retrospective review identified 8271 patients with 30 episodes of VTE (0.36%). The VTE prediction algorithm classified 51 (0.6%) as high risk (> 5% risk), 322 (3.9%) as moderate risk (1–5% risk) and 7898 (95.5%) as low risk (< 1% risk). AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89–0.97). In our population, prophylaxis of the ‘moderate-’ and ‘high-risk’ cohorts would outperform the sensitivity (60% vs. 53%) and specificity (96% vs. 77%) of current guidelines while anticoagulating substantially fewer patients (373 vs. 1935, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A VTE prediction algorithm using clinical variables can identify injured children at risk for venous thromboembolic disease with more discrimination than current guidelines. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the validity of this model. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III—Clinical decision rule evaluated in a single population.

METHODS: Adult patients (at least 18 years of age) with at least 1 diagnostic code for RSV were identified using the 5% US Medicare database from 2011 through 2015. Patients were required to have continuous health plan enrollment for 180 days pre- and 180 days post-RSV diagnosis (baseline and follow-up periods, respectively). HR was defined as diagnosis of chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, or weakened immune system for 180 days during the baseline period. Patients were categorized as initially hospitalized if hospitalized within 1 day of RSV diagnosis. Logistic regression models were developed to determine predictors of initial hospitalization. Healthcare utilization and costs for 180 days pre- and post-RSV diagnosis were compared. RESULTS: The study included 756 HR patients who were initially hospitalized with RSV diagnoses. Among these, 61.7% were diagnosed in the emergency department vs 15.3% in a physician’s office, with hypertension (76.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (53.7%), and high cholesterol (52.0%) observed as the most prevalent comorbidities. Of these, COPD, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and previous evidence of pneumonia were significant predictors of hospitalization. Other significant predictors of hospitalization included older age, hematological malignancies, stroke, and baseline healthcare resource use. Among both HR and non-HR hospitalized patients, there was a significant increase in healthcare resource utilization following hospitalization, including the number of inpatient admissions and longer hospital stays post-RSV diagnosis. The total mean all-cause healthcare costs among HR hospitalized patients increased by $9210 per patient (p < 0.0001) post-RSV diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries with RSV infections pose a significant healthcare burden as compared with non-hospitalized patients, mainly driven by higher comorbidity, higher likelihood of multiple inpatient admissions, and costly medical interventions.","Wyffels, Veronique; Kariburyo, Furaha; Gavart, Sandra; Fleischhackl, Roman; Yuce, Huseyin",Adv Ther,121,28

The investigation of the biological relevance of non-coding RNAs has led to the identification of numerous novel RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, defining the RNA sequences and structures that are selectively recognised by an RBP remains challenging, since these interactions can be transient and highly dynamic, and may be mediated by unstructured regions in the protein, as in the case of many non-canonical RBPs. Numerous experimental and computational methodologies have been developed to predict, identify and verify the binding between a given RBP and potential RNA partners, but navigating across the vast ocean of data can be frustrating and misleading. In this mini-review, we propose a workflow for the identification of the RNA binding partners of putative, newly identified RBPs. The large pool of potential binders selected by in-cell experiments can be enriched by in silico tools such as catRAPID, which is able to predict the RNA sequences more likely to interact with specific RBP regions with high accuracy. The RNA candidates with the highest potential can then be analysed in vitro to determine the binding strength and to precisely identify the binding sites. The results thus obtained can furthermore validate the computational predictions, offering an all-round solution to the issue of finding the most likely RNA binding partners for a newly identified potential RBP.","Colantoni, Alessio; Rupert, Jakob; Vandelli, Andrea; Tartaglia, Gian Gaetano; Zacco, Elsa",Biochem Soc Trans,121,1

However, majority of patients have not benefited from checkpoint therapies that only partially remove the inhibition of T cell functions. Insufficient systemic T cell responses, low immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive environment of tumors, create great challenges on therapeutic efficiency. Nanotechnology can integrate multiple functions within controlled size and shape, and has been explored as a unique avenue for the development of cancer immunotherapy.

Catalpol is an iridoid glycoside that exerts a hypoglycemic effect by improving mitochondrial function, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In the current study we explored the effects of catalpol on mitochondrial function in db/db mice and C2C12 myotubes in vitro. After oral administration of catalpol (200 mg·kg(−1)·d(−1)) for 8 weeks, db/db mice exhibited a decreased fasting blood glucose level and restored mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Catalpol increased mitochondrial biogenesis, evidenced by significant elevations in the number of mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA levels, and the expression of three genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammaco-activator 1 (PGC-1α), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1). In C2C12 myotubes, catalpol significantly increased glucose uptake and ATP production. These effects depended on activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. Thus, catalpol improves skeletal muscle mitochondrial function by activating AMPK-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings may guide the development of a new therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes.","Xu, Deng-qiu; Li, Chun-jie; Jiang, Zhen-zhou; Wang, Lu; Huang, Hong-fei; Li, Zhi-jian; Sun, Li-xin; Fan, Si-si; Zhang, Lu-yong; Wang, Tao",Acta Pharmacol Sin,121,1

Our in situ portal from the tegumented capsid adopts a closed conformation with its channel valve holding the terminal viral DNA and with its crown region firmly engaged by three layers of ring-like dsDNA, which, together with the penton flexibility, effectively alleviates the capsid inner pressure placed on the portal cap. In contrast, the CATCs, through binding to the flexible penton vertices in a stoichiometric manner, accurately increase the inner capsid pressure to facilitate the pressure-driven genome delivery. Together, our results provide important insights into the mechanism by which the EBV capsid, portal, packaged genome and the CATCs coordinately achieve a pressure balance to simultaneously benefit both viral genome retention and ejection.","Li, Zhihai; Zhang, Xiao; Dong, Lili; Pang, Jingjing; Xu, Miao; Zhong, Qian; Zeng, Mu-Sheng; Yu, Xuekui",Cell Res,121,1

Some body postures function as amplifiers, a class of signals that increase the detection likelihood of other signals. While foraging on the ground, bonobos (Pan paniscus) can adopt different crouching postures exposing more or less of their genital area. To our knowledge, their potential functional role in the sociosexual life of bonobos has not been assessed yet. Here we show, by analysing more than 2,400 foraging events in 21 captive bonobos, that mature females adopt a rear-exposing posture (forelimb-crouch) and do so significantly more often when their anogenital region is swollen than during the non-swollen phase. In contrast, mature males almost completely avoid this posture. Moreover, this strong difference results from a diverging ontogeny between males and females since immature males and females adopt the forelimb-crouch at similar frequencies. Our findings suggest that the forelimb-crouch posture may play a communicative role of amplification by enhancing the visibility of female sexual swellings, a conspicuous signal that is very attractive for both males and females. Given the high social relevance of this sexual signal, our study emphasizes that postural signalling in primates probably deserves more attention, even outside of reproductive contexts.","Demuru, Elisa; Pellegrino, François; Dediu, Dan; Levréro, Florence",Sci Rep,121,8

Antibiotic susceptibility to nine antibiotic agents was tested with the microdilution method in 93 Campylobacter spp. (45 C. jejuni and 25 C. coli from chickens; 23 C. coli from pigs). High rates of resistance were observed to nalidixic acid (79.6%), erythromycin (75.3%), tetracycline (68.8%), azithromycin (66.7%), ciprofloxacin (64.5%), and gentamicin (35.5%), with a lower resistance rate to florfenicol (8.6%). The prevalence of the tested antibiotic resistance in C. coli was higher than in C. jejuni from chickens. The rate of antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin in C. coli isolates from chickens was 100.0%, and the C. coli isolates from pigs were all resistant to erythromycin (100%). Most of C. jejuni (64.4%) and C. coli (64.5%) isolates displayed multi-drug resistance. All the Campylobacter spp. isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones had the C257T mutation in the gyrA gene. All 64 tetracycline-resistant Campylobacter spp. isolates were positive for the tetO gene. The tetA gene was also amplified in 6.5% of Campylobacter spp. isolates, whereas tetB was not detected among the isolates. The A2075G point mutation in the 23S rRNA gene occurred in 86.1% (62/72) of the macrolides-resistant Campylobacter spp. isolates, and the ermB gene was identified in 49 Campylobacter spp. isolates (30 C. jejuni and 19 C. coli). Amino acid insertions or mutations in the L4 and L22 ribosomal proteins were not linked to macrolide resistance. These results highlight the high prevalence of resistance to multiple antibiotics, particular macrolides, among Campylobacter spp. from chickens and pigs in Jiangsu Province, China, which is probably attributable to the overuse of antimicrobials in chicken and pig production. These findings recommend the more cautious use of critical antimicrobial agents in swine and poultry production. Stringent and continuous surveillance is required to reduce the drug-resistant campylobacteriosis in food animals and humans.","Tang, Mengjun; Zhou, Qian; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Zhou, Sheng; Zhang, Jing; Tang, Xiujun; Lu, Junxian; Gao, Yushi",Front Microbiol,121,8

To describe the relevant cell populations in an unbiased manner, we carried out a single-cell transcriptome analysis of the adult murine colon, producing a high-quality atlas of matched colonic epithelium and mesenchyme. We identify two crypt-associated colonic fibroblast populations that are demarcated by different strengths of platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (Pdgfra) expression. Crypt-bottom fibroblasts (CBFs), close to the intestinal stem cells, express low levels of Pdgfra and secrete canonical Wnt ligands, Wnt potentiators, and bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) inhibitors. Crypt-top fibroblasts (CTFs) exhibit high Pdgfra levels and secrete noncanonical Wnts and Bmp ligands. While the Pdgfra(low) cells maintain intestinal stem cell proliferation, the Pdgfra(high) cells induce differentiation of the epithelial cells.

Given the peak age of onset for most mental health problems is in adolescence, it is vital that adolescents have access to mental health counselling. There are several initiatives to increase access to mental health counselling in South Africa, primarily through the integration of counselling for common mental disorders (CMD) into primary health care services, but adolescents (15–18 years of age) generally do not utilize these services. To address this gap, we will undertake a study to explore the feasibility of conducting a trial of the effectiveness of a community-based mental health counselling intervention for adolescents at-risk for a CMD. METHODS: The study is a feasibility trial of the ASPIRE intervention, a four-session blended multi-component counselling intervention adapted for South African adolescents at risk for depression and alcohol use disorders. We will enrol 100 adolescents from community settings and randomly assign them to the ASPIRE intervention or a comparison condition. Feasibility measures, such as rates of recruitment, consent to participate in the trial and retention, will be calculated. Qualitative interviews with participants and counsellors will explore the acceptability of the intervention. The primary outcomes for a subsequent trial would be reductions in symptoms of depression and days of heavy drinking which will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post-randomization. DISCUSSION: This feasibility trial using a mixed-methods design will allow us to determine whether we can move forward to a larger effectiveness trial of the ASPIRE intervention.

However, the rapid economic growth of the past decades has caused frequent regional air pollution incidents, as indicated by high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Therefore, a driving force factor analysis based on the PM2.5 of the whole area would provide more information. This paper focuses on the three urban agglomerations in the YREB and uses exploratory data analysis and geostatistics methods to describe the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of air quality based on long-term PM2.5 series data from 2015 to 2018. First, the main driving factor of the spatial stratified heterogeneity of PM2.5 was determined through the Geodetector model, and then the influence mechanism of the factors with strong explanatory power was extrapolated using the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) models. The results showed that the number of enterprises, social public vehicles, total precipitation, wind speed, and green coverage in the built-up area had the most significant impacts on the distribution of PM2.5. The regression by MGWR was found to be more efficient than that by traditional Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), further showing that the main factors varied significantly among the three urban agglomerations in affecting the special and temporal features.","Yan, Jin-Wei; Tao, Fei; Zhang, Shuai-Qian; Lin, Shuang; Zhou, Tong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,121,28

We and others have shown that OSA was associated with diabetes-related microvascular complications in patients with T2D in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and that compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduced the progression of microvascular complications. Hence, we hypothesised that adequate CPAP reduces the development of microvascular complication in patients with T2D. METHODS: SLEEP T2D is a cohort study with embedded feasibility, open-label, parallel-arm, randomised control trial (RCT) over 2 years. The primary aim is the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT assessing the impact of CPAP on chronic kidney disease and other microvascular complications in patients with T2D. The main parameters are to assess willingness of participants to be randomised, follow-up rates, CPAP adherence/compliance, to optimise the choice of outcome measures for a substantive trial, and to identify the parameters for sample size calculations. The secondary aims of the study are related to the impact of CPAP, sleep-related disorders, and sleep chronotype on a variety of diabetes-related end points. The study participants were recruited from the T2D services in multiple NHS trusts across England. The main exclusion criteria for the cohort study are as follows: T1D, eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), known OSA, active malignancy or chronic kidney disease from reasons other than diabetes, pregnancy, professional drivers, and a history of falling asleep whilst driving within last 2 years. The main exclusion criteria from the RCT were as follows: Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index < 10 and Epworth Sleepiness Score ≥ 11. Study participants were extensively phenotyped clinically and biochemically. The OSA diagnosis was based on multichannel portable device (ApneaLink Air(TM), Resmed). DISCUSSION: The feasibility RCT will help us design the future RCT to assess the impact of CPAP on diabetes-related microvascular complications. The cohort study will generate preliminary data regarding the impact of sleep quality, duration, and chronotype on diabetes-related outcomes which could lead to further mechanistic and interventional studies.

Intrauterine exposure to GDM raises the risk for complications in offspring as well, including stillbirth, macrosomia, and birth trauma, and long-term risk of metabolic disease. One of the strongest risk factors for GDM is the occurrence of GDM in a prior pregnancy. Preliminary data from epidemiologic and bariatric surgery studies suggest that reducing body weight before pregnancy can prevent the development of GDM, but no adequately powered trial has tested the effects of a maternal lifestyle intervention before pregnancy to reduce body weight and prevent GDM recurrence. METHODS: The principal aim of the Gestational Diabetes Prevention/Prevención de la Diabetes Gestacional is to determine whether a lifestyle intervention to reduce body weight before pregnancy can reduce GDM recurrence. This two-site trial targets recruitment of 252 women with overweight and obesity who have previous histories of GDM and who plan to have another pregnancy in the next 1–3 years. Women are randomized within site to a comprehensive pre-pregnancy lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss with ongoing treatment until conception or an educational control group. Participants are assessed preconceptionally (at study entry, after 4 months, and at brief quarterly visits until conception), during pregnancy (at 26 weeks’ gestation), and at 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome is GDM recurrence, and secondary outcomes include fasting glucose, biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease, prenatal and perinatal complications, and changes over time in weight, diet, physical activity, and psychosocial measures. DISCUSSION: The Gestational Diabetes Prevention /Prevención de la Diabetes Gestacional is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a lifestyle intervention delivered before pregnancy to prevent GDM recurrence. If found effective, the proposed lifestyle intervention could lay the groundwork for shifting current treatment practices towards the interconception period and provide evidence-based preconception counseling to optimize reproductive outcomes and prevent GDM and associated health risks.

Hepatic FXR loss results in lipid and BA accumulation, and progression from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of xanthohumol (XN), a hop-derived compound mitigating metabolic syndrome, on liver damage induced by diet and FXR deficiency in mice. Wild-type (WT) and liver-specific FXR-null mice (FXR(Liver−/−)) were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) containing XN or the vehicle formation followed by histological characterization, lipid, BA and gene profiling. HFD supplemented with XN resulted in amelioration of hepatic steatosis and decreased BA concentrations in FXR(Liver−/−) mice, the effect being stronger in male mice. XN induced the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression in the liver of FXR(Liver−/−) mice. These findings suggest that activation of BA detoxification pathways represents the predominant mechanism for controlling hydrophobic BA concentrations in FXR(Liver−/−) mice. Collectively, these data indicated sex-dependent relationship between FXR, lipids and BAs, and suggest that XN ameliorates HFD-induced liver dysfunction via FXR-dependent and independent signaling.","Paraiso, Ines L.; Tran, Thai Q.; Magana, Armando Alcazar; Kundu, Payel; Choi, Jaewoo; Maier, Claudia S.; Bobe, Gerd; Raber, Jacob; Kioussi, Chrissa; Stevens, Jan F.",Front Pharmacol,121,8

Hence, the final maturation step releasing functional 40S ribosomal subunits, namely processing of the 18S ribosomal RNA 3′ end, is safeguarded by the protein DIM2, which both interacts with the endoribonuclease NOB1 and masks the rRNA cleavage site. To elucidate the control mechanism that unlocks NOB1 activity, we performed cryo-electron microscopy analysis of late human pre-40S particles purified using a catalytically inactive form of the ATPase RIO1. These structures, together with in vivo and in vitro functional analyses, support a model in which ATP-loaded RIO1 cooperates with ribosomal protein RPS26/eS26 to displace DIM2 from the 18S rRNA 3′ end, thereby triggering final cleavage by NOB1; release of ADP then leads to RIO1 dissociation from the 40S subunit. This dual key lock mechanism requiring RIO1 and RPS26 guarantees the precise timing of pre-40S particle conversion into translation-competent ribosomal subunits.","Plassart, Laura; Shayan, Ramtin; Montellese, Christian; Rinaldi, Dana; Larburu, Natacha; Pichereaux, Carole; Froment, Carine; Lebaron, Simon; O'Donohue, Marie-Françoise; Kutay, Ulrike; Marcoux, Julien; Gleizes, Pierre-Emmanuel; Plisson-Chastang, Celia",,121,8

The mortality and morbidity associated with epidemic and pandemic influenza puts a heavy burden on health care system. Most patients with influenza can be treated on an outpatient basis but some required critical care. It is crucial for frontline physicians to stratify influenza patients by level of risk. Therefore, this study aimed to create a prediction model for critical care and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study extracted data from the Chang Gung Research Database. This study included the patients who were diagnosed with influenza between 2010 and 2016. The primary outcome of this study was critical illness. The secondary analysis was to predict in-hospital mortality. A two-stage-modeling method was developed to predict hospital mortality. We constructed a multiple logistic regression model to predict the outcome of critical illness in the first stage, then S1 score were calculated. In the second stage, we used the S1 score and other data to construct a backward multiple logistic regression model. The area under the receiver operating curve was used to assess the predictive value of the model. RESULTS: In the present study, 1680 patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall ICU admission and in-hospital mortality was 10.36% (174 patients) and 4.29% (72 patients), respectively. In stage I analysis, hypothermia (OR = 1.92), tachypnea (OR = 4.94), lower systolic blood pressure (OR = 2.35), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.87), leukocytosis (OR = 2.22), leukopenia (OR = 2.70), and a high percentage of segmented neutrophils (OR = 2.10) were associated with ICU admission. Bandemia had the highest odds ratio in the Stage I model (OR = 5.43). In stage II analysis, C-reactive protein (OR = 1.01), blood urea nitrogen (OR = 1.02) and stage I model’s S1 score were assocaited with in-hospital mortality. The area under the curve for the stage I and II model was 0.889 and 0.766, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The two-stage model is a efficient risk-stratification tool for predicting critical illness and mortailty. The model may be an optional tool other than qSOFA and SIRS criteria.

Although NE cases have been reported for decades, little is known about the hantavirus strains associated with human infection in these regions. There is also limited understanding of the pathogenesis of NE in the RT and the RM. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted comparative analyses of patients with NE in the RT and the RM. Clinical symptoms were more severe in patients with NE from the RM with longer observed duration of fever symptoms and hospitalization. Analysis of patient sera showed changes in the levels of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in patients with NE from both the RT and the RM, suggesting leukocyte activation, extracellular matrix degradation, and leukocyte chemotaxis. Interestingly, levels of several cytokines were distinctly different between patients NE from the RT when compared with those from the RM. These differences were not related to the genetic variation of orthohantaviruses circulating in those regions, as sequence analysis showed that Puumala virus (PUUV) was the causative agent of NE in these regions. Additionally, only the “Russia” (RUS) genetic lineage of PUUV was detected in the serum samples of patients with NE from both the RT and the RM. We therefore conclude that differences in serum cytokine, chemokine, and MMP levels between the RT and the RM are related to environmental factors and lifestyle differences that influence individual immune responses to orthohantavirus infection.","Martynova, Ekaterina; Davidyuk, Yuriy; Kabwe, Emmanuel; Garanina, Ekaterina E.; Shakirova, Venera; Pavelkina, Vera; Uskova, Yulia; Stott, Robert J.; Foster, Toshana L.; Markelova, Maria; Goyal, Mehendi; Gupta, Abhimat; Bhola, Mannan; Kumar, Vinay; Baranwal, Manoj; Rizvanov, Albert A.; Khaiboullina, Svetlana F.",Pathogens,121,1

We sought to assess the prevalence and socio-demographic associations of obesity nationwide. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of overall obesity (body mass index ≥28 kg/m(2)) and abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥85/90 cm for women/men) among 2.7 million community-dwelling adults aged 35 to 75 years in the China PEACE Million Persons Project from 2014 to 2018 and quantified the socio-demographic associations of obesity using multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: Age-standardized rates of overall and abdominal obesity were 14.4% (95% CI, 14.3%–14.4%) and 32.7% (32.6%–32.8%) in women and 16.0% (15.9%–16.1%) and 36.6% (36.5%–36.8%) in men. Obesity varied considerably across socio-demographic subgroups. Older women were at higher risk for obesity (eg, adjusted relative risk [95% CI] of women aged 65–75 versus 35–44 years: 1.29 [1.27–1.31] for overall obesity, 1.76 [1.74–1.77] for abdominal obesity) while older men were not. Higher education was associated with lower risk in women (eg, adjusted relative risk [95% CI] of those with college or university education versus below primary school: 0.47 [0.46–0.48] for overall obesity, 0.61 [0.60–0.62] for abdominal obesity) but higher risk in men (1.07 [1.05–1.10], 1.17 [1.16–1.19]). CONCLUSIONS: In China, over 1 in 7 individuals meet criteria for overall obesity, and 1 in 3 for abdominal obesity. Wide variation exists across socio-demographic subgroups.

We used the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) database to obtain the related ED visits and developed statistical models using daily data on ED visits, temperature, relative humidity, and outdoor air pollution concentration levels. The NACRS database contains data on hospital-based and community-based ambulatory care. The environmental data were retrieved from the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) program. The NAPS is the main source of ambient air quality data in Canada. We considered 2 air quality health indexes and 6 air pollutants: daily means of fine particulate matter PM(2.5), O(3), CO, NO(2), SO(2), and also maximum 8-hour average ozone. For every air pollutant, we fit 270 models (15 lags × 18 strata). We found that same-day air pollution concentrations have the highest number of statistically significantly positive associations with ED visits for genitourinary health outcomes. A total of 133 positive associations were identified over the 14 days lag. In subgroup (strata) analysis, females older than 60 years of age were found to have the most positive associations. In particular, nitrogen dioxide was found to be highly associated with ED visits for females over 60; an increase in NO(2) was associated with an increased relative risk (RR) of ED visits when lagged over 0, 1, and 2 days (RR = 1.040 [95% confidence interval: 1.028, 1.052], 1.020 [1.009, 1.032], and 1.025 [1.013, 1.036], respectively).

In order to ensure the smooth development of the NIMBY facility PPP projects, the problem of choosing the most suitable operation mode among many PPP modes is still scarce and unscientific. In order to select the operation mode of the PPP projects that best fits the characteristics of the project, this paper constructs the operation mode selection of the NIMBY facility PPP project. Firstly, the index system of operation mode selection of the NIMBY facility PPP project is determined. G1 subjective weighting method and information entropy objective weighting method are introduced to solve the optimal weight of each index. Grey correlation theory is used to improve TOPSIS method, and the calculation form of relative proximity degree is optimized to determine the most suitable operation mode for the project. In this paper, combined weighting and TOPSIS method are applied to the research of NIMBY facility PPP project, and the operation mode selection of NIMBY facility PPP project is established, which makes up the blank of this part. Finally, a PPP project in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, is taken as an example to verify the applicability of the model. The effectiveness of this model was tested by comparing the results of TOPSIS method, Grey target model, Extended matter-element mode and GRA-TOPSIS.

Recently, it was used as the basic concept for high technology diagnostics. The specificity of the assay depends on the exclusion of detection cross-reactivity which arises from using two antibodies developed in different species. Since mice and rats are the common laboratory animals used to develop antigen specific antibodies. Therefore, the questions we addressed here were (1) can one use antigen-specific antibodies raised in mice and rats in the same assay to specifically detect/quantify antigens? and (2) which antibodies of the two rodents should be placed for capturing and for detection in the antigen-detection sandwich? RESULTS: Direct ELISA assay was used to assess for the specific reaction of the HRP-conjugated antibody to the target serum. First reaction was to compare between either conjugate anti-rat IgG (homologous) or anti-mouse IgG (heterologous) for the detection of rat sera IgG. Following the dilution factor optimization, the O.D. were 0.744±0.051 and 0.604±0.05, respectively (p= .004). The difference in mean O.D. of 0.14 reflected an unaccepted non-specific reaction. The second reaction was to compare between either conjugate anti-mouse IgG (homologous) and anti-rat IgG (heterologous) for the detection of mouse sera IgG. The recorded O.D. were 0.9414±0.14 and 0.317 ±0.141, respectively (p= .0002). The improved difference in mean O.D. of 0.624 reflecting a minimized cross-reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that it is possible to use both Swiss albino mice and albino rats in a single sandwich ELISA, given that the captured antibody species to be from the Swiss albino mice and the detection antibody to be from the albino rat. The described working details are limited to the source of the antibodies used in the study. However, the approach stresses on the importance of such optimization steps before making any interpretations based on the antigen detection. To our knowledge, this study is the first to cover the optimal order of the capturing and the detection antibodies in a sandwich ELISA assay. In addition to addressing the possible interfering cross-reactivity that result from using mouse and rat serum antibodies in a single assay.

Although artificial neural network (ANN) prediction models have been reported and are superior to traditional models, the ANN prediction model for PTE is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aim to train and validate an ANN model to anticipate the risks of PTE. METHODS: The training cohort was TBI patients registered at West China Hospital. We used a 5-fold cross-validation approach to train and test the ANN model to avoid overfitting; 21 independent variables were used as input neurons in the ANN models, using a back-propagation algorithm to minimize the loss function. Finally, we obtained sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each ANN model from the 5 rounds of cross-validation and compared the accuracy with a nomogram prediction model built in our previous work based on the same population. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the model using patients registered at Chengdu Shang Jin Nan Fu Hospital (testing cohort 1) and Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital (testing cohort 2) between January 1, 2013, and March 1, 2015. RESULTS: For the training cohort, we enrolled 1301 TBI patients from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017. The prevalence of PTE was 12.8% (166/1301, 95% CI 10.9%-14.6%). Of the TBI patients registered in testing cohort 1, PTE prevalence was 10.5% (44/421, 95% CI 7.5%-13.4%). Of the TBI patients registered in testing cohort 2, PTE prevalence was 6.1% (25/413, 95% CI 3.7%-8.4%). The results of the ANN model show that, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the training cohort was 0.907 (95% CI 0.889-0.924), testing cohort 1 was 0.867 (95% CI 0.842-0.893), and testing cohort 2 was 0.859 (95% CI 0.826-0.890). Second, the average accuracy of the training cohort was 0.557 (95% CI 0.510-0.620), with 0.470 (95% CI 0.414-0.526) in testing cohort 1 and 0.344 (95% CI 0.287-0.401) in testing cohort 2. In addition, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictors in the training cohort (testing cohort 1 and testing cohort 2) were 0.80 (0.83 and 0.80), 0.86 (0.80 and 0.84), 91% (85% and 78%), and 86% (80% and 83%), respectively. When calibrating this ANN model, Brier scored 0.121 in testing cohort 1 and 0.127 in testing cohort 2. Compared with the nomogram model, the ANN prediction model had a higher accuracy (P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the ANN model can predict the risk of PTE and is superior to the risk estimated based on traditional statistical methods. However, the calibration of the model is a bit poor, and we need to calibrate it on a large sample size set and further improve the model.","Wang, Xueping; Zhong, Jie; Lei, Ting; Chen, Deng; Wang, Haijiao; Zhu, Lina; Chu, Shanshan; Liu, Ling",J Med Internet Res,121,28

Appreciation of pulmonary pathology in the medicolegal context is important as it frequently contributes to the immediate or underlying mechanisms of death. The primacy of the lungs in breathing and their coordinated function with the cardiovascular system means that ­pulmonary failure can rapidly compromise tissue oxygenation and body chemistry, leading to an alteration in blood pH, hypoxic damage to downstream tissues and ultimately multiorgan failure and death. Moreover, given that the lungs have direct contact with the environment through inhalation and receive approximately 50% of the cardiac output with each beat of the heart, they may be adversely affected by hazardous agents from the outside world or other pathologic processes not primarily located in the lungs. The range of topics discussed herein is limited by design to deaths due to disease and largely foregoes discussion of more forensically relevant issues relating to toxicology or trauma. Furthermore, the content and format of this chapter is not intended to be encyclopedic, but rather attempts to highlight selected issues regarding pulmonary disease of potential relevance to surgical or forensic pathologists who perform medicolegal postmortem examinations.","Cunningham, Kris S.; Pollanen, Michael S.",Forensic Pathology Reviews,121,1

The use of respiratory filters interposed in respiratory circuits to avoid ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was proposed after reports between 1952 and 1972 of several outbreaks of respiratory infections attributed to contamination of anesthesia machines; however, none of the reports presented a bacteriological demonstration of a cause-and-effect relationship. The use of respiratory filters has not decreased the incidence of VAP in patients on anesthesia machines and in critically ill patients. Besides, respiratory filters could have some undesirable effects such as the increase of resistance to inspiratory airflow, increase of resistance to expiratory airflow and increase of dead space in the breathing circuit. Thus, the use of respiratory filters is not routinely necessary; however, they should be used in patients with suspected or confirmed highly communicable respiratory infections (such as bacillary pulmonary tuberculosis) and who require mechanical ventilation).","Lorente, Leonardo",Humidification in the Intensive Care Unit,121,28

CCF displays a number of similarities with the mammalian cytokine tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) as a result of a shared N,N′‐diacetylchitobiose lectin‐like domain. However, these similarities are solely functional and are not based on any (DNA or amino acid) sequence homology, thus suggesting a form of convergent evolution. In particular, the lectin‐like domain of TNF‐α has been shown to induce membrane depolarization in various mammalian cell types, through interactions with endogenous amiloride‐sensitive ion channels. This nonreceptor‐mediated activity of TNF‐α has been reported to be involved in the resorption of oedema. Likewise, the lectin‐like domain of CCF also induces membrane depolarization in mammalian cells. Here, we show that CCF appears to be able to induce oedema resorption in an alveolar epithelial cell line through its lectin‐like domain. This lectin‐like domain of CCF interacts (directly or indirectly) with endogenous sodium and/or chloride channels, and not potassium channels, on mammalian cells. Additionally, we suggest that the JNK/SAPK and Erk1/2 pathways are involved in CCF‐induced macrophage activation. These results further establish the functional analogy between an invertebrate pattern recognition molecule and a mammalian cytokine and, from a more applied point of view, suggest the possibility of utilizing CCF in the treatment of oedema.","Van Den Bergh, R.; Bilej, M.; De Baetselier, P.; Beschin, A.",Scand J Immunol,121,1

Hence, the modified arithmetical formula of Reed and Muench has been integrated with other formulas and used to determine bacterial colony forming unit/viral concentration, virulence and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Microorganisms’ antigens tested are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice and rat, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas veronii in fish, New Castle Disease virus in chicken, Sheep Pox virus, Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus and Hepatitis A virus in vitro, respectively.

Titer index (TI) equals N log(10) LC(50) and provides protection against lethal dose in graded fashion which translates to protection index. N is the number of vaccine dose that could neutralize the LC(50).

Although the environment and lifestyle of the Korean people have recently undergone rapid changes, corresponding changes in the characteristics of AR patients have not been well documented. Therefore, we aimed to outline the changes in allergens and clinical manifestations of AR in Korean patients from the 1990s and 2010s. METHODS: We reviewed 1447 and 3388 AR patients who visited the same tertiary hospital in the 1990s and 2010s, respectively. All patients were diagnosed with AR based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, positive skin prick test results, and answered a symptom questionnaire at the time of visit. We compared differences in the allergens and results of the symptom questionnaire between the two sets of patients. RESULTS: When compared with the 1990s, the rate of sensitization to house dust mites, cockroaches, Aspergillus, Alternaria, and tree pollen significantly increased and that to cat fur significantly decreased in patients from the 2010s (all P < 0.05). Male predominance was observed with two peaks in the age distribution of patients from the 2010s. The proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe nasal obstruction and itching of the nose/eye increased (each P < 0.05) and that of patients with minor symptoms such as olfactory disturbances, cough, sore throat, and fatigue also increased (all P < 0.01) in the 2010s. CONCLUSIONS: Allergen reactivity and type and symptom severity in Korean AR patients significantly varied between the 1990s and 2010s. Our results may therefore be helpful for patient counseling and management.","Kim, Ji Heui; Kim, Shin Ae; Ku, Ja Yoon; Cho, Won Ki; Shin, Chol Ho",Allergy Asthma Clin Immunol,121,33

The purpose of this review is to highlight current research on these conditions, their inter-relationship, modes of measurement, and current approaches to management. RECENT FINDINGS: Sleep deprivation and delirium are closely linked, with shared clinical characteristics, risk factors, and neurochemical abnormalities. Acetylcholine and dopamine are important neurochemicals in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness and their dysregulation has been implicated in development of delirium. In the hospital setting, poor sleep and delirium are associated with adverse outcomes; non-pharmacological interventions are recommended, but tend to be resource intensive and hindered by a lack of reliable sleep measurement tools. Delirium is easier to identify, with validated tools available in both ICU and non-ICU settings; however, an optimal treatment approach remains unclear. Antipsychotics are used widely to prevent and treat delirium, although the efficacy data are equivocal. Bundled non-pharmacologic approaches represent a promising framework for prevention and management. SUMMARY: Poor sleep and delirium are common problems in older patients. While these phenomena appear linked, a causal relationship is not clearly established. At present, there are no established sleep-focused guidelines for preventing or treating delirium. Novel interventions are needed that address poor sleep and delirium, particularly in older adults.","Farasat, Sadaf; Dorsch, Jennifer J.; Pearce, Alex K.; Moore, Alison A.; Martin, Jennifer L.; Malhotra, Atul; Kamdar, Biren B.",Curr Sleep Med Rep,121,11

In many malignancies, TME characteristics are also predictive of response to immunotherapy. As window of opportunity studies using neoadjuvant immunotherapy become more common and treatment guidelines incorporate TME features, accurate assessment of the pre-treatment TME using the biopsy specimen is critical. However, no study has thoroughly evaluated the correlation between the TMEs of the biopsy and resection specimens. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with stage I–III CRC with matched biopsy and resection specimens. CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and FoxP3+ lymphocyte populations at the center of tumor (CT) and invasive margin (IM) and tumor PD-L1 status in the biopsy and resection specimens were evaluated. TIL populations were compared using Mann–Whitney U tests or Student’s t tests and correlated using Pearson r. RESULTS: CD3+ and CD4+ densities were significantly higher in the CT of the biopsy relative to the resection specimen Comparing biopsy and resection specimens, no TIL population at either the CT or IM had a correlation coefficient > 0.5. Determining PD-L1 status based on biopsy tissue resulted in a sensitivity of 37.1%, specificity of 81.4%, and accuracy of 61.5%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate significant discordance between the TME of the biopsy and resection specimens. Caution should be used when basing treatment decisions on pre-treatment endoscopic biopsy findings and when interpreting changes in the TME between pre-treatment biopsy and resection specimens after neoadjuvant therapy.

METHODS: LAR owners and staff were recruited via social media and community networks across the US. Potential participants completed an online survey (n = 20) on demographic and restaurant characteristics and current HEP strategies. Subsequently, we conducted semi-structured, online interviews with LAR owners and staff (n = 13) to examine attitudes of and barriers to the implementation of HEP strategies. Each verbatim transcript was analyzed by two coders using Dedoose, following an iterative process. Excerpts were rated according to how open respondents were to implement potential strategies (1 = opposed, 2 = neutral, 3 = open). RESULTS: The survey revealed that the most common HEP strategies already in place were offering vegetarian options (80%) and seafood (75%). The interviews asked about additional, potential HEP strategies, showing that the highest rated was the provision of nutrition information, with all excerpts rated as “open” (rate = 3). This was followed by increasing healthy options, notably vegetarian dishes (Mean excerpt rate = 2.9 ± 0.3); menu highlights (2.6 ± 0.9); and promotion of healthier options (2.5 ± 0.7). Portion size changes were rated the lowest (1.1 ± 0.3). The results included barriers identified for each strategy, the influence of COVID-19, and alternative strategies identified. CONCLUSIONS: Latin communities present higher dietary risk factors for chronic disease, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. LARs are a significant source of dietary intake and have the potential to positively influence eating behaviors but are seldom engaged by public health. This research aimed to bridge this gap, finding common grounds for potential collaborations benefiting both community health and the wellbeing of these important community institutions.

The spectrum of possible causes is wide, and diagnostic work-up is challenging. In their acute presentation, MDs may represent the prominent symptom or an important diagnostic clue in a broader constellation of neurological and extraneurological signs. The diagnostic approach relies on the definition of the overall clinical syndrome and on the recognition of the prominent MD phenomenology. The recognition of the underlying disorder is crucial since many causes are treatable. In this review, we summarize common and uncommon causes of acute-onset movement disorders, focusing on clinical presentation and appropriate diagnostic investigations. Both acquired (immune-mediated, infectious, vascular, toxic, metabolic) and genetic disorders causing acute MDs are reviewed, in order to provide a useful clinician’s guide to this expanding field of pediatric neurology.","Garone, Giacomo; Graziola, Federica; Grasso, Melissa; Capuano, Alessandro",J Clin Med,121,20

Industrial products are usually protected by opaque housing, so most internal detection methods are based on X-rays. Since the dense structural features of industrial products, it is challenging to detect the occluded parts only from projections. Limited by the data acquisition and reconstruction speeds, CT-based detection methods do not achieve real-time detection. To solve the above problems, we design an end-to-end single-projection 3D segmentation network. For a specific product, the network adopts a single projection as input to segment product components and output 3D segmentation results. In this study, the feasibility of the network was verified against data containing several typical assembly errors. The qualitative and quantitative results reveal that the segmentation results can meet industrial assembly real-time detection requirements and exhibit high robustness to noise and component occlusion.","Li, Xuan; Wang, Sukai; Niu, Xiaodong; Wang, Liming; Chen, Ping",Comput Intell Neurosci,121,28

High risk HPV (Hr-HPV) 16 and 18 together account for more than 70% of cervical cancer cases, whereas the hr-HPV-18 is the second most prevalent hr-HPV type, causing about 5.2% of all cancers worldwide. Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate, cervical cancer remains a noteworthy health problem among women. As of now, no registered immunotherapies are available after the HPV infection. Thus, developing an immunotherapeutic candidate against hr-HPV would be of major clinical benefit. Nowadays, the T-and B-cell peptide based targeted vaccines have been considered as the best candidate for vaccine development against viral infections. In this study, both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine candidates against hr-HPV-18 were predicted. To achieve this, the prediction of T-and B-cell epitopes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) were accomplished, that can be used for HPV immunotherapy. For MHC-I, a maximum number (20) of potent peptides were found, against HLA-B*51:01 (L1 = 9, L2 = 6, E2 = 4, and E4 = 1) having percentile value < 1 and, immunogenicity scores higher than 0.5, followed by HLA-A*11:01 (L1 = 8, E2 = 7 L2 = 2, and E6 = 1, E7 = 1); 19 epitopes. For MHC-II, the highest number of peptides found, against the HLA-DRB1*04:01 (L2 = 10, E5 = 7, and E4 = 4), HLA-DRB1*04:05 (E5 = 7, E2 = 5, E4 = 5, and L1 = 4) HLA-DPA1*01:03/DPB1*04:01 (E7 = 7, E6 = 5, L2 = 5, and E2 = 2), HLA-DRB5*01:01(E6 = 6, L1 = 6, and L2 = 6); peptides 21, 21, 19 and 18 respectively. For B-cell, total 94, 16 amino acid long B-cell epitopes were predicted. In conclusion, these predicted epitopes can be valuable candidates for in vitro or in vivo therapeutic vaccine studies against hr-HPV-18 associated cancer.","Gupta, Bharti; Kumar, Anoop; Sridevi, Parikipandla",Int J Pept Res Ther,121,24

The results showed a high level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine was maintained for at least 400 days. In the study of non-human primates, PIKA adjuvanted S-trimer induced high SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers and protected from virus replication in the lung following SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

The cat population housed in a large group was monitored for 1 year. The data recording took place at 2-week intervals. A total of 220 cats were evaluated using a protocol containing eight health-oriented welfare indicators: body condition, third eye visibility, eye discharge, eye irritation, nose discharge, the presence of pathologically induced respiratory sounds, coat condition, and lameness and abnormal posture. The assessment was performed based on the observation by two trained evaluators. The cats' condition was rated on a 5-point scale for each indicator, where the optimal condition was represented by the score of 1 and a severe deterioration by the score of 5 for the given indicator, except for the body condition indicator, where the optimal condition was represented by the score of 3. A deterioration in the score in at least one of the indicators during the stay in the shelter was recorded in 52 (41.6%) of 125 cats that were assessed at least twice. The effect of the LOS, sex and age on the scores for each health indicator was examined via a linear mixed model analysis, as this method allows for handling of dependencies in the data of repeated measurements. The effect of predictors on the third eye visibility scores was not found. The age of cats predicted the coat condition and body condition scores. The LOS predicted scores of the abnormal posture and lameness indicator and scores of a composite index composed of indicators related to upper respiratory tract disease. The results suggest that despite the fact that some improvement of health was documented during the cats' stay in the shelter, there were a non-negligible number of animals experiencing a permanent or long-term deterioration in health. Efforts to minimize the undesirable factors contributing to the deterioration of well-being of cats during their stay in a shelter should be made.","Vojtkovská, Veronika; Voslářová, Eva; Večerek, Vladimír",Front Vet Sci,121,13

This study aimed to characterize the influence of polymer material on mesh behavior at the hiatus. METHODS 24 pigs in three groups of eight underwent implantation of either polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh placed circularly at the esophageal hiatus. After 8 weeks, necropsy and measurements were performed evaluating mesh deformation, adhesion formation, fixation of the esophagogastric junction and mesh position. Foreign body reaction was assessed by mononuclear cell count and immunostaining of Ki-67. Tissue integration was evaluated by immunostaining of type I and type III collagen fibers. RESULTS Mesh shrinkage was the highest for PTFE, lower for PP and the lowest for PET (34.9 vs. 19.8 vs. 12.1 %; p = 0.002). Mesh aperture for the esophagus showed an enlargement within all groups, which was highest for PTFE compared to PP and PET (100.8 vs. 47.0 vs. 35.9 %; p = 0.001). The adhesion score was highest for PP, lower for PTFE and the lowest for PET (11.0 vs. 9.5 vs. 5.0; p = 0.001) and correlated positively with the score of esophagogastric fixation (r s = 0.784, p < 0.001). No mesh migration, erosion or stenosis of the esophagus occurred. Evaluation of foreign body reaction and tissue integration showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS In this experimental setting, PP-meshes showed the most appropriate characteristics for augmentation at the hiatus. Due to solid fixation of the esophagogastric junction and low shrinkage tendency, PP-meshes may be effective in preventing hiatal hernia recurrence. The use of PTFE-mesh at the hiatus may be disadvantageous due to high shrinkage rates and correlating enlargement of the aperture for the esophagus.","Müller-Stich, B P; Senft, J D; Lasitschka, F; Shevchenko, M; Billeter, A T; Bruckner, T; Kenngott, H G; Fischer, L; Gehrig, T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,121,16

Multiple levels of PPE exist (level D - level A), providing progressively more protection. Emergent endotracheal intubation (ETI) of victims can become complicated by the cumbersome nature of PPE. STUDY OBJECTIVE The null hypothesis was tested that there would be no difference in time to successful ETI between providers in different types of PPE. METHODS This randomized controlled trial assessed time to ETI with differing levels of PPE. Participants included 18 senior US Emergency Medicine (EM) residents and attendings, and nine US senior Anesthesiology residents. Each individual performed ETI on a mannequin (Laerdal SimMan Essential; Stavanger, Sweden) wearing the following levels of PPE: universal precautions (UP) controls (nitrile gloves and facemask with shield); partial level C (PC; rubber gloves and a passive air-purifying respirator [APR]); and complete level C (CC; passive APR with an anti-chemical suit). Primary outcome measures were the time in seconds (s) to successful intubation: Time 1 (T1) = inflation of the endotracheal tube (ETT) balloon; Time 2 (T2) = first ventilation. Data were reported as medians with Interquartile Ranges (IQR, 25%-75%) or percentages with 95% Confidence Intervals (95%, CI). Group comparisons were analyzed by Fisher's Exact Test or Kruskal-Wallis, as appropriate (alpha = 0.017 [three groups], two-tails). Sample size analysis was based upon the power of 80% to detect a difference of 10 seconds between groups at a P = .017; 27 subjects per group would be needed. RESULTS All 27 participants completed the study. At T1, there was no statistically significant difference (P = .27) among UP 18.0s (11.5s-19.0s), PC 21.0s (14.0s-23.5s), or CC 17.0s (13.5s-27.5s). For T2, there was also no significant (P = .25) differences among UP 24.0s (17.5s-27.0s), PC 26.0s (21.0s-32.0s), or CC 24.0s (19.5s-33.5s). CONCLUSION There were no statistically significant differences in time to balloon inflation or ventilation. Higher levels of PPE do not appear to increase time to ETI.","Doukas, Donald; Arquilla, Bonnie; Halpern, Pinchas; Silverberg, Mark; Sinert, Richard",Prehospital and disaster medicine,121,10

PURPOSE To describe the implementation of an IV room technology-assisted workflow (TAWF) system integrated within a health system's electronic medical record (EMR) and compare the TAWF system's impact in improving workflow at multiple ambulatory infusion pharmacies. SUMMARY IV room TAWFs help to standardize intravenous admixture operations while incorporating patient safety measures such as ingredient barcode scanning and image capture. The 4 oncology infusion center pharmacies of a large health system implemented a TAWF system integrated within the health system's EMR software, transitioning to the new TAWF system from an external TAWF system operating outside of the EMR. Considerable planning was required to determine the hardware and workflow processes needed for the new integrated TAWF system to function within pharmacy IV rooms. Several operational challenges were encountered during the initial implementation phase of the project. Frequent occurrence of system malfunctions during the product imaging step was the largest problem, which was overcome by special hardware and a software upgrade. The project also involved an evaluation of the integrated TAWF system after implementation to ensure the pharmacies maintained operational efficiency and patient safety. The evaluation showed that after an initial transition period, the new technology was able to maintain IV admixture efficiency and safety. CONCLUSION This project and subsequent evaluation showed the operational feasibility, efficiency, and safety of a TAWF integrated within the health system's EMR software.","Flanagin, Connor M; Little, Jeff; Brookins, Leslie; Wills, Meredith",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,121,33

It is not known whether these variations predispose unruptured ACOM aneurysms to grow over time. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the course of patients with untreated, unruptured ACOM aneurysms monitored with serial imaging at our institution. The primary outcome of interest was aneurysm growth. Predictors of aneurysm growth were determined using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS There were 81 patients with an unruptured ACOM aneurysm who were included in our study. Growth occurred in 9 (11.1%) patients, yielding a yearly growth rate of 2.8%. Aneurysms that grew were larger on initial detection than were those that remained stable in size (8.3 mm vs. 6.2 mm; P = 0.031). The ratio of the diameter of A1 segments was greater in patients with aneurysms that grew (2.1 vs. 1.4; P = 0.003), as was the frequency of patients with an A1 ratio >2.3 (25.0% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.023). Among aneurysms that grew, location at the A1-A2 junction was more common than origination solely from the ACOM (88.9% vs. 11.1%). When follow-up time was adjusted for, increasing aneurysm size (unit relative risk [RR] 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.45; P = 0.011) and location at the A1-A2 junction (RR 6.15, 95% CI 1.12-114.49; P = 0.035) were significant predictors of aneurysm growth. CONCLUSIONS We identify several anatomic characteristics that may be associated with increased risk of ACOM aneurysm growth. These data could influence management strategies of unruptured ACOM aneurysms.","Rinaldo, Lorenzo; Lanzino, Giuseppe",World neurosurgery,121,17

We evaluated the prevalence of elevated DC in OSA patients presenting for positive airway pressure (PAP) alternative therapies and identified gaps in available resources about OSA therapies. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed based on questionnaires completed by adult OSA patients presenting to an academic sleep surgery clinic from March to October 2020. Surveys examined sleep symptoms, sleep apnea treatment history, goals of therapy, and the SURE checklist, a validated 4-item DC screening scale. Additional qualitative data about OSA decision tool needs were queried with structured interviews in a smaller subset of patients. RESULTS Among 100 respondents, 60 were open to multiple treatment options, whereas 22 were not interested in surgical treatment. Eighty-one respondents (81%) had elevated DC (SURE score < 4). High DC was not associated with CPAP history, OSA severity, or daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score ≥ 10). Elevated DC was related to uncertainty regarding optimal treatment choice in 54% of respondents (n = 54), and lack of knowledge regarding risks and benefits of each treatment option in 71% (n = 71). Common themes identified in 9 interviewed patients suggested helpful resources should ideally compare treatment modalities and educate on surgery details, efficacy, and recovery. CONCLUSIONS The majority of OSA patients presenting to sleep surgery clinics have elevated decisional conflict influenced by limited knowledge about options and the risks and benefits of each therapy.

In that regard, wearable biosensing technologies, capable of tracking drug pharmacokinetics in noninvasively retrievable biofluids (e.g., sweat), play a critical role, because they can be deployed at a large scale to monitor the individuals' drug transcourse profiles (semi)continuously and longitudinally. To this end, voltammetry-based sensing modalities are suitable, as in principle they can detect and quantify electroactive drugs on the basis of the target's redox signature. However, the target's redox signature in complex biofluid matrices can be confounded by the immediate biofouling effects and distorted/buried by the interfering voltammetric responses of endogenous electroactive species. Here, we devise a wearable voltammetric sensor development strategy-centering on engineering the molecule-surface interactions-to simultaneously mitigate biofouling and create an ""undistorted potential window"" within which the target drug's voltammetric response is dominant and interference is eliminated. To inform its clinical utility, our strategy was adopted to track the temporal profile of circulating acetaminophen (a widely used analgesic and antipyretic) in saliva and sweat, using a surface-modified boron-doped diamond sensing interface (cross-validated with laboratory-based assays, R 2 ∼ 0.94). Through integration of the engineered sensing interface within a custom-developed smartwatch, and augmentation with a dedicated analytical framework (for redox peak extraction), we realized a wearable solution to seamlessly render drug readouts with minute-level temporal resolution. Leveraging this solution, we demonstrated the pharmacokinetic correlation and significance of sweat readings.","Lin, Shuyu; Yu, Wenzhuo; Wang, Bo; Zhao, Yichao; En, Ke; Zhu, Jialun; Cheng, Xuanbing; Zhou, Crystal; Lin, Haisong; Wang, Zhaoqing; Hojaiji, Hannaneh; Yeung, Christopher; Milla, Carlos; Davis, Ronald W; Emaminejad, Sam",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,121,5

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional, observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Chughtai Lab Lahore from 20th to 30th May 2020. METHODOLOGY One hundred and fifty-four young policemen (mean age 27.1 ±3.8 years) were included in the study after written consent. Squad officers who had any sign of acute respiratory infection were excluded from the study. The participants were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding nature of exposure with the infected cases, kind of personal protective equipment they are provided with and living arrangements. Three ml of blood samples were collected from the participants and immediately sent to the lab for analysis. COVID-19 IgG antibodies were analysed using chemiluminescence immunoassay method on Architect Ci8200 (Abbott). SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis. RESULTS All participants were males and mean age was 27.1 ±3.8 years. Out of 154 squad members, 24 were reactive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies and performing duties at the areas of high virus exposure. None of COVID-19 IgG reactive cases exhibited symptoms and most of them performed duties at high risk areas with only masks provided as personal protective equipment. Only 10% of the participants who were exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found to have anti-COVID IgG. CONCLUSION COVID-19 IgG antibody reactive cases may not show any symptoms. Police force is at high risk of exposure. Serosurveys can help to find the spread of infection in the community and aid in planning healthcare strategies.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 30 (n = 30) biopsy samples obtained after hysterectomy in women with diffuse adenomyosis of grade II-III, accompanied by severe pain syndrome, who did not receive hormonal therapy. The morphologic comparison group comprised 30 (n = 30) biopsy samples obtained from women with adenomyosis, without pain syndrome, operated on for abnormal uterine bleeding, who also did not receive hormone therapy. RESULTS The total density of immunological OTR labeling in the adenomyotic lesion foci was 73.7 ± 1.8%, and in the morphological control group it was 35.2 ± 1.4% (p <0.05), which indicates a significant effect of oxytocin as a ureterotonic peptide. Processes of local neurogenesis and growth of nerve fibers was established due to an increase in the expression of the nervous system growth factor NGF in the myometrium stroma, in comparison with biopsy samples of morphological control. Conclusion: Pelvic pain pathogenesis in women with diffuse adenomyosis compared with the painless form of the disease is an increase in the activity of ureterotonic factors of OTR oxytocin. Compared to the painless form of adenomyosis, the myometrial innervation apparatus of patients with pelvic pain is characterized by a significantly higher expression of nerve growth factor.","Orazov, Mekan; Radzinsky, Victor; Sharapova, Olga; Kostin, Igor; Chitanava, Yurii",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,121,22

Nanoparticles encapsulating an antibiotic drug, ofloxacin, were fabricated using emulsion solvent evaporation technique adopting 23 full factorial design to evaluate the effect of formulation parameters: that is to say, the molecular weight of the polymer (polycaprolactone), amount of Kolliphor P188, and presence of the charge inducer (chitosan hydrochloride) on the measured responses: drug entrapment efficiency (EE%), particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential (ZP). The results show that the optimized LPCL-NP2 formulation (composed of low molecular weight polycaprolactone, 500 mg of Kolliphor P188, 0.25% chitosan hydrochloride, and 50 mg ofloxacin) displayed a sphere shape with EE%, PS, PDI, and ZP values of 89.73 ± 0.04%, 195.4 ± 13.17 nm, 0.323 ± 0.01, and 55.4 ± 0.66 mV, respectively. DSC study confirmed the amorphous nature of the drug. The optimized nanoparticle formulation was then further incorporated into the following two ocular formulations: gel (LPCL-NP2-G4) and in situ forming gel (LPCL-NP2-ISG4). The penetration of optimized ocular formulations was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The antimicrobial study was conducted for the following three ocular formulations: LPCL-NP2 presented as eye drops, LPCL-NP2-G4, and LPCL-NP2-ISG4 as well as the market product using rabbits which were infected in their eyes with Escherichia coli. Results revealed that rabbits treated with LPCL-NP2-ISG4 demonstrated a remarkable antibacterial efficacy and evident low bacterial growth which was additionally assured by the histopathological examination of eye biopsies compared with the other investigated groups. Thus, a novel ofloxacin-loaded nanoparticle formulation based on polycaprolactone is presented in the form of mucoadhesive non-irritating in situ forming ocular gel possessing a superior antibacterial activity.

Impulsivity has been extensively studied in addiction literature, but not in the context of opioid misuse. Hence, this study aimed to identify which of the impulsivity facets (negative urgency, positive urgency, sensation seeking, lack of perseverance, and lack of premeditation) would predict current aberrant opioid-related behaviors in patients with chronic pain. METHODS Data were collected through an online survey from patients with chronic pain who visited a tertiary pain clinic. Patients were predominately female (74%), middle aged (M = 55 years), and White/Caucasian (84%). Upon consent, they completed a series of surveys including UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, the Current Opioid misuse Measure, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, PROMIS-anxiety, depression, and physical function, and a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale. Ordinal regression analyses were conducted to test study hypotheses. RESULTS Contrary to expectations, only lack of premeditation predicted higher odds of aberrant opioid-related behaviors in the past 30 days, after controlling for known covariates, and explained 26% of variance. Interestingly, lack of premeditation together with pain catastrophizing as a covariate explained 56% of the variance in aberrant opioid-related behaviors. DISCUSSION The current study is the first to identify a potential role of lack of premeditation as an impulsivity facet predicting aberrant opioid-related behaviors among patients with chronic pain.","Hettie, Gabrielle; Nwaneshiudu, Chinwe; Ziadni, Maisa S; Darnall, Beth D; Mackey, Sean C; You, Dokyoung S",Substance use & misuse,121,19

METHODS A quasi-experimental, multicentre, controlled and prospective intervention study is proposed, in which early factors influencing new food acceptance will be studied. Mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy (n = 144) and their infants will be the study population. Experimental groups will be established based on mothers´ fruit and vegetable intake (standard or high intake) and weaning method (baby lead weaning vs spoon feeding). The project will assess the possible impact of maternal diet and complementary feeding on infants eating behaviour until 18 months of age. Outcome measures will comprise maternal diet and psychological features during pregnancy and breast-feeding (validated questionnaires). Compositional and physicochemical analysis of milk during breastfeeding will also be carried out. During weaning, until 18 months of age, children's diet will be assessed with 24 h recalls and acceptance of new fruits and vegetables will be studied using video recording.

However, during social interactions, as in any dynamical system, patterns of coordination form and dissipate at different scales. Historically, researchers have used aggregate measures to capture coordination over time. While those measures (e.g., mean relative phase, cross-correlation, coherence) have provided a wealth of information about coordination in social settings, some evidence suggests that multiscale coordination may change over the time course of a typical empirical observation. To address this gap, we demonstrate an underutilized method, windowed multiscale synchrony, that moves beyond quantifying aggregate measures of coordination by focusing on how the relative strength of coordination changes over time and the scales that comprise social interaction. This method involves using a wavelet transform to decompose time series into component frequencies (i.e., scales), preserving temporal information and then quantifying phase synchronization at each of these scales. We apply this method to both simulated and empirical interpersonal physiological and neuromechanical data. We anticipate that demonstrating this method will stimulate new insights on the mechanisms and functions of synchrony in interpersonal contexts using neurophysiological and behavioral measures.","Aaron, D Likens; Travis, J Wiltshire",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,121,29

Digital technologies provide the opportunity to deliver tailored and progressive programs at home. However, it is unknown if they are effective in older people, especially in those with cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of a novel tablet-delivered cognitive-motor program on mobility in older people with cognitive impairment. METHODS This was a 6-month single-blind randomised controlled trial of older people living in the community with subjective and/or objective cognitive impairment. Participants randomised to the intervention were asked to follow a 120 min per week balance, strength and cognitive training program delivered via an app on an iPad. Both the intervention and control group received monthly phone calls and health fact sheets. The primary outcome measure was gait speed. Secondary measures included dual-task gait speed, balance (step test, FISCIT-4), 5 sit to stand test, cognition (executive function, memory, attention), mood and balance confidence. Adherence, safety, usability and feedback were also measured. RESULTS The planned sample size of 110 was not reached due to COVID-19 restrictions. A total of 93 (mean age 72.8 SD 7.0 years) participants were randomised to the two groups. Of these 77 participants returned to the follow-up clinic. In intention-to-treat analysis for gait speed, there was a non-significant improvement favouring the intervention group (β 0.04 m/s 95% CI -0.01, 0.08). There were no significant findings for secondary outcomes. Adherence was excellent (84.5%), usability of the app high (76.7% SD 15.3) and no serious adverse events were reported. Feedback on the app was positive and included suggestions for future updates. CONCLUSION Due to COVID-19 the trial was under powered to detect significant results. Despite this, there was a trend towards improvement in the primary outcome measure. The excellent adherence and positive feedback about the app suggest a fully powered trial is warranted.","Callisaya, Michele L; Jayakody, Oshadi; Vaidya, Anagha; Srikanth, Velandai; Farrow, Marree; Delbaere, Kim",Experimental gerontology,121,27

STUDY DESIGN Case series with planned data collection. SETTING Tertiary endocrine surgery practice in an academic medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An analysis was undertaken of 561 consecutive patients undergoing parathyroid surgery in a tertiary endocrine surgery practice from March 2004 to April 2013. There were 270 patients who had curative primary or reoperative surgery for single-gland parathyroid adenomas during this time. Clinical records, imaging studies, operative reports, and pathology findings were evaluated, and cases from a subset of patients who had an ectopic, overly descended superior parathyroid adenoma were further analyzed. The prevalence of this entity in primary and revision surgeries was calculated. RESULTS Among the 270 patients with single-gland parathyroid adenomas, there were 251 primary operations and 19 reoperative procedures referred from outside institutions. An ectopic, overly descended superior parathyroid adenoma was present in 23 (9.2%) primary cases and 4 (21.1%) reoperative cases. CONCLUSION An overly descended superior parathyroid adenoma is frequently encountered during primary parathyroid surgery. It is more than twice as common in reoperative parathyroidectomy, reflecting the propensity to be missed at the first exploration. Recognition and proper treatment of this entity at the initial operation will reduce the need for revision surgery.","Duke, William S; Vernon, Hampton M; Terris, David J",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,121,1

In this review, we appraise the most robust and commonly used technologies within the fields of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics, together with their targeted validation approaches. We summarize the transference process from the discovery phase until clinical translation. Finally, we review the best candidate biomarkers and their potential clinical applicability. Expert opinion: Some available biomarkers are promising, especially in the field of epigenomics: DNA methylation and microRNA. Transference requires the joint collaboration of basic researchers, intellectual property experts, technology transfer offices and clinicians. Blood-based biomarkers will be selected not only based on their diagnostic accuracy and cost, but also on their reliability, applicability to clinical analysis laboratories and their acceptance by the population.","Gallardo-Gómez, María; De Chiara, Loretta; Álvarez-Chaver, Paula; Cubiella, Joaquin",Expert review of anticancer therapy,121,19

Experimental data shows that solid mammary tumors depend on aerobic glycolysis during the day but likely revert to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation at night for ATP production. This conversion of diseased cells during the day to a healthier phenotype at night occurs under control of the circulating melatonin rhythm. When the nocturnal melatonin rise is inhibited by light exposure at night, cancer cells function in the diseased state 24/7. The ability of melatonin to switch cancer cells as well as other diseased cells, e.g., Alzheimer disease, fibrosis, hyperactivation of macrophages, etc., from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation may be a basic protective mechanism to reduce pathologies.","Reiter, Russel J; Sharma, Ramaswamy; Ma, Qiang",Journal of pineal research,121,27

Survey data were collected from both groups to compare outcomes. Additional comparisons were made to total center experience with 1300 laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. RESULTS A total of 135 patients completed successful single-port donor nephrectomy without major complication or open conversion. Another 16 patients required additional port placement because of excessive intra-abdominal fat or limited abdominal domain. Compared with multiple-port donor nephrectomy, single-port patients had similar operative times to cross clamp (2.8 vs 2.6 hours; P = 0.11) that normalized after a learning curve of approximately 50 cases. Recipient creatinine levels were similar at 1 week and 1 month posttransplant. Although 36-Item Short Form Health Surveys demonstrated no significant differences, additional survey data revealed that single-port patients were more satisfied with cosmetic outcomes (P < 0.01) and the overall donation process (P = 0.01). Single-port approach had similar outcomes compared with all previous laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. CONCLUSIONS Single-port donor nephrectomy can be integrated as a standardized approach for renal donation without additional donor risk, and with benefits of improved patient satisfaction with cosmetic and overall outcomes. Although the primary benefit is cosmetic, (a single incision predominantly contained within the umbilicus) outcomes justify application for kidney donors in experienced centers and may motivate additional living kidney donation.","Barth, Rolf N; Phelan, Michael W; Goldschen, Lauren; Munivenkatappa, Raghava B; Jacobs, Stephen C; Bartlett, Stephen T; Philosophe, Benjamin",Annals of surgery,121,1

Treatments for AD are based on environmental controls, topical and systemic therapies, and allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT). However, it remains unclear the effectiveness and adverse events of AIT and all conventional topical treatments compared with placebo and each other for AD. METHODS We will search five electronic databases [Central Cochrane register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS] from inception until November 2019 with no language restriction, and we will include experimental studies [randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and quasi-RCTs]. The primary outcome is global and specific skin symptoms assessment. Secondary outcomes are hospital length of stay, quality of life, and adverse events. Reviewers independently will extract data from the studies that meet our inclusion criteria and will assess the risk of bias of individual primary studies. We will conduct random effects pairwise meta-analyses for the observed pairwise comparisons with at least two trials. Then, we will perform random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to obtain treatment effects for all possible comparisons and to provide a hierarchy of all interventions for each outcome. Possible incoherence between direct and indirect sources of evidence will be investigated locally (if possible) and globally. To investigate sources of statistical heterogeneity, we will perform a series of meta-regression analyses based on pre-specified important effect modifiers. Two authors will appraise the certainty of the evidence for each outcome applying the GRADE's framework for NMA. DISCUSSION The findings of this systematic review will shed the light on the effectiveness and adverse events of all possible comparisons for treating AD and on the quality of the collated evidence for recommendations. It will also provide critical information to health care professionals to comprehend and manage this disease at different age stages, treatment type, duration, and severity of atopic dermatitis.

An urgent need for potential therapeutic intervention is of necessity. Mpro is an attractive druggable target for the development of anti-COVID-19 drug development. Compounds previously characterized from Melissa officinalis were queried against main protease of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using computational approach. RESULTS Melitric acid A and salvanolic acid A had higher affinity than lopinavir and ivermectin using both AutodockVina and XP docking algorithms. The computational approach was employed in the generation of QSAR model using automated QSAR, and in the docking of ligands from Melissa officinalis with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The best model obtained was KPLS_Radial_28 (R2 = 0.8548 and Q2=0.6474, and was used in predicting the bioactivity of the lead compounds. Molecular mechanics based MM-GBSA confirmed salvanolic acid A as the compound with the highest free energy and predicted bioactivity of 4.777; it interacted with His-41 of the catalytic dyad (Cys145-His41) of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), as this may hinder the cutting of inactive viral protein into active ones capable of replication. CONCLUSION Salvanolic acid A can be further evaluated as potential Mpro inhibitor.","Elekofehinti, Olusola O; Iwaloye, Opeyemi; Famusiwa, Courage D; Akinseye, Olanrewaju; Rocha, Joao B T",Current drug discovery technologies,121,13

METHODS We conducted computer-aided telephone interviews in 2007 with a cross-sectional sample of rural and metropolitan residents of South Australia. RESULTS Of 1975 households interviewed, half (50.2%) had never heard of pandemic influenza or were unaware of its meaning. Only 10% of respondents were extremely concerned about the threat of pandemic influenza. Respondents identified children as the highest priority for vaccination, if supplies were limited; they ranked politicians and teachers as the lowest priority. Although only 61.7% of respondents agreed with a policy of home isolation, 98.2% agreed if it was part of a national strategy. Respondents considered television to be the best means of educating the community. CONCLUSION s. Community knowledge about pandemic influenza is poor despite widespread concern.

Clinically, respiratory tract symptoms as well as other organs disorders are observed in patients positively diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, neurological symptoms, mainly anosmia, ageusia and headache were observed in many patients. Once in the central nervous system (CNS), the SARS-CoV-2 can reside either in a quiescent latent state, or eventually in actively state leading to severe acute encephalitis, characterized by neuroinflammation and prolonged neuroimmune activation. SRAS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The expression of this receptor in endothelial cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB) shows that SRAS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared to known coronaviruses. This review summarizes available information regarding the impact of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain and tended to identify its potential pathways of neuroinvasion. We offer also an understanding of the long-term impact of latently form of SARS-CoV-2 on the development of neurodegenerative disorders. As a conclusion, the persistent infection of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain could be involved on human neurodegenerative diseases that evolve a gradual process, perhapes, over several decades.","ElBini Dhouib, Ines",Drug discoveries & therapeutics,121,1

Midwives play a major role in prenatal care. However, little research has examined alcohol-related information provided by midwives. OBJECTIVE To examine alcohol-related messages disseminated to pregnant women by midwives. METHODS In 2018, 61 certified professional midwives (CPMs) and certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) were recruited from professional organizations in a southwestern state. Midwives responded to an online cross-sectional survey containing the prompt: ""A pregnant patient confides in you that she drinks alcohol. She then asks you to tell her a ""safe"" level of alcohol consumption that won't cause harm to her unborn fetus. How would you respond?"" Open-ended responses were analyzed through content analysis and categorized using an inductive approach. RESULTS Responses were grouped into five non-exclusive themes: ""harmful effects and unknown safe limits"" (77.0%); ""abstaining is best"" (50.8%); ""light drinking is acceptable"" (16.4%); ""describe your drinking"" (21.3%); ""I will refer you"" (16.4%). The most frequently shared messages were ""safe levels of prenatal alcohol use are unknown"" (68.9%) and ""discontinue alcohol during pregnancy"" (45.9%). However, some messages contradicted US dietary guidelines, including ""a little bit of alcohol unlikely to cause harm"" (11.5%); ""cut-down if having more than 1-2 drinks per occasion"" (4.9%); and ""if you must drink, wine is best"" (1.6%). CPMs were less likely to share abstinence messages (p = .003) and more likely to suggest referrals (p = .024), compared to CNMs. CONCLUSION Concerted efforts are needed to ensure information disseminated aligns with health guidelines and encourages abstinence during pregnancy.","Olusanya, Olufunto A; Olokunlade, Temitope; Rossheim, Matthew E; Greene, Kaylin; Barry, Adam E",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,121,1

BACKGROUND Although many hepatobiliary centers have adopted MWA, the factors that influence local control are not well described. METHODS Consecutive patients with hepatic malignancy treated by MWA were included from 4 high-volume institutions (2003-2011) and grouped by histology: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal liver metastases, neuroendocrine liver metastases, and other cancers. Independent significance of outcome variables was established with logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Four hundred fifty patients were treated with 473 procedures (139 HCC, 198 colorectal liver metastases, 61 neuroendocrine liver metastases, and 75 other) for a total of 875 tumors. Median follow-up was 18 months. Concurrent hepatectomy was performed in 178 patients (38%), and when performed was associated with greater morbidity. Complete ablation was confirmed for 839 of 865 tumors (97.0%) on follow-up cross-sectional imaging (10 were unevaluable). A surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous) had no significant impact on complication rates, recurrence, or survival. The local recurrence rate was 6.0% overall and was highest for HCC (10.1%, P = 0.045) and percutaneously treated lesions (14.1%, P = 0.014). In adjusted models, tumor size 3 cm or more predicted poorer recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.02-2.50, P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS In this large data set, patients with 3 cm or more tumors showed a propensity for early recurrence, regardless of histology. Higher rates of local recurrence were noted in HCC patients, which may reflect underlying liver disease. There were no significant differences in morbidity or survival based on the surgical approach; however, local recurrence rates were highest for percutaneously ablated tumors.","Groeschl, Ryan T; Pilgrim, Charles H C; Hanna, Erin M; Simo, Kerri A; Swan, Ryan Z; Sindram, David; Martinie, John B; Iannitti, David A; Bloomston, Mark; Schmidt, Carl; Khabiri, Hooman; Shirley, Lawrence A; Martin, Robert C G; Tsai, Susan; Turaga, Kiran K; Christians, Kathleen K; Rilling, William S; Gamblin, T Clark",Annals of surgery,121,14

In children with a suprasellar tumor and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, the circadian rhythm may be disturbed causing sleep problems. However, also other factors may influence sleep. Awareness of these different etiologies and careful history taking with appropriate additional diagnostics will aid in restoring sleep quality. METHODS We present the workup of 4 cases with a suprasellar tumor and disturbances of sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, and daytime sleepiness. In parallel, we developed a flowchart, to aid clinicians in the diagnostics of sleep problems in children after treatment for a (supra) sellar brain tumor. RESULTS All four patients, known with hypopituitarism, presented with sleep complaints and increased daytime sleepiness. In all four, the cause of sleep problems showed to be different. In the first case, sleep evaluation revealed a severe obstructive sleep apnea, whereupon nocturnal ventilation was started. The second case revealed poor sleep hygiene in combination with an obsessive compulsive disorder. Sleep hygiene was addressed and psychiatric consultation was offered. Dexamphetamine treatment was started to reduce her obsessive compulsive complaints. The third case showed a delayed sleep phase syndrome, which improved by educational support. The fourth case revealed a secondary organic hypersomnia for which modafinil treatment was started. CONCLUSION Sleep disturbances in children with hypopituitarism due to a (supra) sellar tumor can have different entities which require specific therapy. Awareness of these different entities is important to enable appropriate counseling. Referral to an expertise sleep center may be advised, if standard educational support is insufficient.","van Schaik, J; Pillen, S; van Litsenburg, R R L; Vandenbussche, N L E; de Bont, J M; Schouten-van Meeteren, A Y N; van Santen, H M",Pituitary,121,28

By 2011, universal health insurance coverage was successfully achieved through the creation of a basic social medical insurance system. Growing economic power, extensive government subsidies, and strategies for program implementation are critical to that achievement. However, the breadth and depth of coverage varies considerably across insurance schemes and localities. The disjointed insurance scheme led to inequality in coverage, accessibility, and affordability of medical services, lopsided allocation of health resources, and increasing medical expenditures, and these remain crucial challenges for healthcare insurance coverage. This paper describes societal conditions, polices, achievements and challenges in improving health insurance coverage in China. Thailand's experience in universal health insurance coverage and its implications for China's new medical reform are also discussed. Solutions including sustainable increases in government investment, transformation of payment methods, reinforcement of primary health care delivery and the referral system, and standardization of benefits packages are strongly recommended to address challenges in China's long-running medical reform.","Zhao, Cuirong; Wang, Chao; Shen, Chengwu; Wang, Qian",Drug discoveries & therapeutics,121,17

This study evaluated the prognostic value of Kras mutation in patients with CLM treated by percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS This is an IRB waived retrospective analysis of the impact of KRAS mutation status on oncologic outcomes after CLM RFA. The endpoints were overall survival (OS), local tumor progression (LTP) rates, and incidence of new liver, lung, and peritoneal metastases. Survival times were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology from the time of RFA. RESULTS The study enrolled 97 patients. Kras exon 2 mutation was detected in 39% (38/97) of patients. On univariate analysis, Kras mutation (P=0.016) (HR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1 - 2.9) was a significant predictor of OS and retained significance on multivariate analysis. Kras mutation was a significant predictor of new liver metastases (P=0.037) (SHR: 2.0; CI: 1.0-3.7) and peritoneal metastases (P=0.015) (sHR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.2-7.2) on multivariate analysis. Kras mutation was a significant predictor of LTP after RFA of CLM ablated with margins of 1-5 mm (P=0.018) (SHR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.2-7.7) with an LTP rate of 80% (12/15) versus 41% (11/27) for wild type. CONCLUSION Kras mutation is a significant predictor of overall survival, new liver, and peritoneal metastases after RFA of CLM. A minimal radiographic ablation margin ≥ 6 mm is essential for local tumor control especially for mutant CLM.","Shady, Waleed; Petre, Elena N; Vakiani, Efsevia; Ziv, Etay; Gonen, Mithat; Brown, Karen T; Kemeny, Nancy E; Solomon, Stephen B; Solit, David B; Sofocleous, Constantinos T",Oncotarget,121,17

Observational, prospective, multicenter study. ARC was defined as a creatinine clearance greater than 130 ml/min/1.73 m2. Eighteen hospitals were recruited. GFR measurements carried out twice weekly during a 2-month follow-up period. A total of 561 patients were included. ARC was found to have a non-negligible prevalence of 30%. More even, up to 10.7% already had ARC at intensive care unit (ICU) admission. No specific pattern of GFR was found during the follow-up. Patients in the ARC group were younger 56.5 (53.5-58.5) versus 66 (63.5-68.5) years than in the non-ARC group, p < 0.001. ICU mortality was lower in the ARC group, 6.9% versus 14.5%, p = 0.003.

Bendewald et al. confirmed that there was no difference in anastomotic stricture rates when comparing hand-sewn (HS), linear-stapled (LS), and circular-stapled (CS) GJA techniques. We present and analyze our own institutional data to readdress stricture rates. METHODS From January 2010 to January 2013, 860 consecutive patients underwent LRYGB using HS, LS, and CS anastomotic techniques at a single institution. All patients in this study were followed to see if they had a complication of a stricture within this time period. Hospital records were retrospectively reviewed and those who had stricture complications shown on endoscopy requiring intervention were compiled and compared using univariate analysis. RESULTS Patient demographics did not differ substantially between the three groups. The most common technique employed was LS (n = 429, 49.8%), followed by CS (n = 254, 29.5%) and HS (n = 177, 20.6%), respectively. Using multivariate analysis, there was a significant difference in the rate of strictures between the anastomotic techniques (LS 4.42%, HS 2.82%, CS 1.18%, p = 0.0163). CONCLUSIONS Our data show that the discussion of which anastomotic technique is superior should be reopened given the statistically significant low rate of strictures in patients who underwent LRYGB with a CS anastomosis in comparison with LS and HS anastomoses.","Qureshi, Azam; Podolsky, Dina; Cumella, Lindsay; Abbas, Mujahid; Choi, Jenny; Vemulapalli, Pratibha; Camacho, Diego",Surgical endoscopy,121,31

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether older adults with sarcopenic obesity have increased risk of falls and fractures or lower bone mass compared with older adults with sarcopenia, obesity, or neither condition. Twenty-six studies (n = 37,124) were included in the systematic review and 17 (n = 31,540) were included in the meta-analysis. Older adults with sarcopenic obesity had lower femoral neck areal bone mineral density (aBMD) compared with those with obesity alone but had higher femoral neck aBMD compared with counterparts with sarcopenia alone (both P < 0.05). Older adults with sarcopenic obesity had higher nonvertebral fracture rates (incidence rate ratio: 1.88; 95% confidence intervals: 1.09, 3.23; based on two studies), compared with those with sarcopenia alone, and also had higher falls risk compared with controls (risk ratio: 1.30; 95% confidence intervals: 1.10, 1.54) and obesity alone (risk ratio: 1.17; 95% confidence intervals: 1.01, 1.36). In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis has demonstrated that older adults with sarcopenic obesity are at increased risk of adverse musculoskeletal outcomes compared with individuals with obesity, sarcopenia, or neither condition. These data support the need for developing interventions to improve bone health and physical function in this population.","Gandham, Anoohya; Mesinovic, Jakub; Jansons, Paul; Zengin, Ayse; Bonham, Maxine P; Ebeling, Peter R; Scott, David",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,121,21

How external signaling pathways connect to core self-renewal transcriptional circuits is largely unknown. To probe this, we chose BMP signaling, which is previously recognized as a master control for both self-renewal and lineage commitment of murine ES cells. Here, we mapped target gene promoter occupancy of SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 on a genome-wide scale and found that they associate with a large group of developmental regulators that are enriched for H3K27 trimethylation and H3K4 trimethylation bivalent marks and are repressed in the self-renewing state, whereas they are rapidly induced upon differentiation. Smad knockdown experiments further indicate that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling is largely required for differentiation-related processes rather than directly influencing self-renewal. Among the SMAD-associated genes, we further identified Dpysl2 (previously known as Crmp2) and the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b (previously known as Jmjd3) as BMP4-modulated early neural differentiation regulators. Combined with computational analysis, our results suggest that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling balances self-renewal versus differentiation by modulating a set of developmental regulators.","Fei, Teng; Xia, Kai; Li, Zhongwei; Zhou, Bing; Zhu, Shanshan; Chen, Hua; Zhang, Jianping; Chen, Zhang; Xiao, Huasheng; Han, Jing-Dong J; Chen, Ye-Guang",Genome research,121,1

METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected regarding sociodemographic characteristics, history of reproduction and gynecology, fertility intention before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, female psychological state, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life. RESULTS Under the influence of COVID-19, 296/447 (66.2%) participants did not change their original fertility intention to have children, while 151/447 (33.8%) of participants were affected by the outbreak. Participants who believed in government and hospital control policies were less likely to change their intention to become pregnant (P<10-3 , P<10-3 ). In contrast, concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on female and fetal health led participants to cancel their original pregnancy plans (P<10-3 ). CONCLUSION Three in ten couples of childbearing age, who originally expressed their intention of becoming pregnant, canceled their pregnancy plans after the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak has brought new challenges to people's physical and mental health. Effective policies and measures can help to improve people's fertility intentions with respect to having children.","Zhu, Chenfeng; Wu, Jiahao; Liang, Yan; Yan, Li; He, Chuqing; Chen, Luting; Zhang, Jian",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,121,5

Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (Ptcco(2)) monitoring can be used to noninvasively and continuously estimate Paco(2). In the present study we evaluated the accuracy of Ptcco(2) monitoring in predicting the Paco(2) during laparoscopic surgeries with prolonged pneumoperitoneum. METHODS Sixteen patients who underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy or radical proctectomy under general anesthesia were included in the study. Their Paco(2), Petco(2), and Ptcco(2) values were measured at 3 time points before and after pneumoperitoneum. Agreement among measures was assessed by the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS Forty-eight sample sets were obtained. The average Paco(2)- Ptcco(2) difference was -0.9 + or - 6.4 mm Hg (mean + or - 2 SD). The average Paco(2) - Petco(2) difference was 7.5 + or - 7.0 mm Hg (mean + or - 2 SD). Paco(2) - Ptcco(2) was less than or equal to + or -5 mm Hg for 88% of the samples. Paco(2) - Petco(2) was less than or equal to + or -5 mm Hg for 17% of the samples (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS While undergoing long-term pneumoperitoneum laparoscopic surgery, Ptcco(2) monitoring is more accurate than is PETCO(2) monitoring in predicting the patients' Paco(2).","Xue, Qingsheng; Wu, Xiaowen; Jin, Jue; Yu, Buwei; Zheng, Minhua",Anesthesia and analgesia,121,30

The use of short synthetic peptides encompassing helical segments to modulate or disrupt such interactions, when associated with human diseases, represents great pharmacological interest. AREAS COVERED Multiple chemical approaches have been developed to increase the conformational and metabolic stabilities of helical peptides and to improve their biomedical potential. After a brief overview of these technologies and the most recent developments, this review will focus on the main therapeutic areas and targets and will discuss their promise. EXPERT OPINION Potential benefits associated with increased helix stability extend beyond simple affinity enhancement. Some peptidomimetic helices are being endowed with features desirable for cellular activity such as increased resistance to proteolysis and/or cell permeability. Recent advances in the field of peptide and related peptidomimetic helices are not just conceptual, but are likely to be of practical utility in the process of optimizing peptides as clinical candidates, and developing medium-size therapeutics.","Estieu-Gionnet, Karine; Guichard, Gilles",Expert opinion on drug discovery,121,4

METHODS A total of 22 cases were published between 2010 and 2011, with our patient being case 23. These procedures were performed in the United States and United Kingdom. Surgical procedures included total colectomy with end ileostomy, proctocolectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, and total proctocolectomy with ileopouch-anal anastomosis. Intraoperative and postoperative data are analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-two of the 23 cases were performed for benign cases including Crohns, ulcerative colitis, and familial adenomatous polyposis. One case was performed for adenocarcinoma of the cecum. The mean age was 35.3 years (range, 13 to 64), the mean body mass index was 20.1 (range, 19 to 25), mean operative time was 175.9 minutes (range, 139 to 216), mean blood loss was 95.3mL (range, 59 to 200), mean incision length was 2.61cm (range, 2 to 3). Average follow-up was 4.6 months with 2 reported complications. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic total colectomy is feasible and safe in the hands of an experienced surgeon. It has been performed for both benign and malignant cases. It is comparable to the conventional multi-port laparoscopic total colectomy.","Paranjape, Charudutt; Ojo, Oluwatosin J; Carne, David; Guyton, Daniel",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,121,32

The present study was carried out to give an insight of therapeutic interventional trials registered under clinical trial registry of India (CTRI) for COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS All trials registered under CTRI were evaluated using keyword ""COVID"" from its inception till 9th June 2020. Out of which, therapeutic interventional studies were chosen for further analysis. Following information was collected for each trial: type of therapeutic intervention (preventive/therapeutic), treatment given, no. of centers (single center/multicentric), type of institution (government/private), study design (randomized/single-blinded/double-blinded) and sponsors (Government/private). Microsoft Office Excel 2007 was used for tabulation and analysis. RESULTS The search yielded total of 205 trials, out of which, 127 (62%) trials were interventional trials. Out of these, 71 (56%) were AYUSH interventions, 36 (28.3%) tested drugs, 9 (7%) tested a nondrug intervention, rest were nutraceuticals and vaccines. About 66 (56%) were therapeutic trials. Majority were single-centered trials, i.e. 87 (73.7%). Trials were government funded in 57 (48.3%) studies. Majority were randomized controlled trials, i.e. 67 (56.8%). AYUSH preparations included AYUSH-64, Arsenic Album, SamshamaniVati etc. CONCLUSIONS The number of therapeutic interventional clinical trials was fair in India.

The COVID-19 assessment also collected psychosocial risk factors expected to moderate changes in adjustment across time. METHOD Participants included 295 young adults (70.8% female; ages 18-21 at baseline), drawn from an ongoing study of daily behaviors and health in college life that oversampled for recent substance behaviors, who completed both the baseline and COVID-19 assessments. Hypotheses were tested using analyses of repeated-measures data that included covariates of length of time between assessments and sampling group status. RESULTS Direct tests in support of hypotheses indicated an increase in negative affect (d = .67, p < .001), and greater alcohol use (d = .75, p < .001) and marijuana use (d = .58, p < .001), in daily life across time. Levels of positive affect (d = .08, p > .05), nicotine use (d = .01, p > .05), and prescription drug misuse (d = .003, p > .05) did not reliably change in tests of direct models. Moderation tests indicated several risk factors for experiencing steeper increases in negative affect, and increased likelihood of marijuana and nicotine use, in daily life across time.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate International Classification of Disease 10th revision (ICD -10) algorithms that identify laboratory-confirmed influenza or laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalizations using population-based health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING Influenza and RSV laboratory data from the 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 respiratory virus seasons were obtained from the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS) and were linked to hospital discharge abstract data to generate influenza and RSV reference cohorts. These reference cohorts were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the ICD-10 algorithms. To minimize misclassification in future studies, we prioritized specificity and PPV in selecting top-performing algorithms. RESULTS 83,638 and 61,117 hospitalized patients were included in the influenza and RSV reference cohorts, respectively. The best influenza algorithm had a sensitivity of 73% (95% CI 72% to 74%), specificity of 99% (95% CI 99% to 99%), PPV of 94% (95% CI 94% to 95%), and NPV of 94% (95% CI 94% to 95%). The best RSV algorithm had a sensitivity of 69% (95% CI 68% to 70%), specificity of 99% (95% CI 99% to 99%), PPV of 91% (95% CI 90% to 91%) and NPV of 97% (95% CI 97% to 97%). CONCLUSION We identified two highly specific algorithms that best ascertain patients hospitalized with influenza or RSV. These algorithms may be applied to hospitalized patients if data on laboratory tests are not available, and will thereby improve the power of future epidemiologic studies of influenza, RSV, and potentially other severe acute respiratory infections.","Hamilton, Mackenzie A; Calzavara, Andrew; Emerson, Scott D; Djebli, Mohamed; Sundaram, Maria E; Chan, Adrienne K; Kustra, Rafal; Baral, Stefan D; Mishra, Sharmistha; Kwong, Jeffrey C",PloS one,121,12

METHODS Magnetization transfer asymmetry ratio images of composite meshes were obtained in vitro and in vivo from fast-spin echo acquisitions with frequency saturation offsets of ±3.5 ppm with respect to water frequency and no saturation. Three rats were assessed with APT-MRI each week for 1 month after the intraperitoneal implantation of two meshes, one on each side of the incision. One mesh was coated with collagen and the other was not. RESULTS In vitro, meshes were delineated with APT-MRI as a thin continuous linear hypersignal located on one side of the mesh. Unlike collagen-free meshes, collagen-coated meshes were easily identified in vivo with APT-MRI during the first 3 weeks postimplantation. The composite meshes magnetization transfer asymmetry ratio (8.7 ± 2.8%) were significantly different from the muscle magnetization transfer asymmetry ratio value (-0.9 ± 1.6%). After a month, the mesh value dropped down to 1.1 ± 3.9%. Muscle and mesh magnetization transfer asymmetry ratio values were not significantly different and mesh conspicuity was no longer possible. CONCLUSION The results suggest that APT-MRI is a promising technique for noninvasive, early postsurgical visualization of composite meshes used in ventral hernia repair.","Franconi, Florence; Roux, Jérome; Garric, Xavier; Lemaire, Laurent",Magnetic resonance in medicine,121,1

Objective: We aimed to assess STD in health care professionals (HCPs), mainly allergists, affected by COVID-19. We carried out a survey to evaluate the association between STD and its severity and demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital admission. METHODS We designed a 15-item questionnaire comprising various sections, as follows: demographics, diagnostic characteristics, STD patterns, medication use, and comorbidities. The questionnaire was developed using Google forms. It was distributed to members of the Spanish Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (SEAIC) and sent via social media to be completed by HCPs with COVID-19. RESULTS The survey was completed by HCPs (n=234), of whom 76.5% were aged ≤55 years and 73.5% were female. STD was detected in 74.4% of respondents, of whom 95.6% reported moderate-severe impairment. Mean time until recovery of taste dysfunction was 21.6 (24.0) days in HCPs aged ≤55 years and 33.61±26.2 days in those aged >55 years (P=.019). Analysis stratified by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 patients presented severe loss of smell. Older age (>55 years) was associated with fever, anorexia, lower frequency of headache, and longer persistence of taste dysfunction. CONCLUSION STD is a common symptom in COVID-19, even as a unique or preceding symptom. HCPs who reported smell dysfunction were younger than those not affected with STD. Taste dysfunction may imply more systemic involvement in COVID-19-positive HCPs.","Antolín Amérigo, D; Cubero, J L; Colás, C; Alobid, I; Mullol, J; Valero, A",Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology,121,31

PURPOSE To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. DESIGN A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. METHODS The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. RESULTS The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout; the need for social and technical support to manage OL; the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity; and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. CONCLUSIONS Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful; however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses.","Suliman, Wafika A; Abu-Moghli, Fathieh A; Khalaf, Inaam; Zumot, Arwa F; Nabolsi, Manar",Nurse education today,121,23

For supervised machine learning, we use convolutional neural networks and find that the corresponding output not only allows to locate the phase transition point with high precision, it also displays a finite-size scaling characterized by an Ising critical exponent. For unsupervised learning, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are trained to generate new configurations that are then used to compute various quantities. We find that RBM generates configurations with magnetizations and energies forbidden in the original physical system. The RBM generated configurations result in energy density probability distributions with incorrect weights as well as in wrong spatial correlations. We show that shortcomings are also encountered when training RBM with configurations obtained from the non-conserved Ising model.","Azizi, Ahmadreza; Pleimling, Michel",Scientific reports,121,1

The purpose of the present study was to design and develop an experimental porcine model of ARDS by inducing lung injury with intrapulmonary administration of sodium polyacrylate (SPA). METHODS The present study was performed at the Centre for Comparative Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia. Human alveolar epithelial cells were cultured with several different concentrations of SPA; a bioluminescence technique was used to assess cell death associated with each concentration. In the anesthetized pig model (female Yorkshire X pigs (n = 14)), lung injury was caused in 11 animals (SPA group) by injecting sequential aliquots (5 mL) of 1% SPA gel in aqueous solution into the distal airway via a rubber catheter through an endotracheal tube. The SPA was dispersed throughout the lungs by manual bag ventilation. Three control animals (CON group) underwent all experimental procedures and measurements with the exception of SPA administration. RESULTS The mean (± SD) ATP concentration after incubation of human alveolar epithelial cells with 0.1% SPA (0.92 ± 0.27 μM/well) was approximately 15% of the value found for the background control (6.30 ± 0.37 μM/well; p < 0.001). Elastance of the respiratory system (E RS) and the lung (E L) increased in SPA-treated animals after injury (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). Chest wall elastance (E CW) did not change in SPA-treated animals. There were no differences in E RS, E L, or E CW in the CON group when pre- and post-injury values were compared. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed a significant shift toward neutrophil predominance from before to after injury in SPA-treated animals (p < 0.001) but not in the CON group (p = 0.38). Necropsy revealed marked consolidation and congestion of the dorsal lung lobes in SPA-treated animals, with light-microscopy evidence of bronchiolar and alveolar spaces filled with neutrophilic infiltrate, proteinaceous debris, and fibrin deposition. These findings were absent in animals in the CON group. Electron microscopy of lung tissue from SPA-treated animals revealed injury to the alveolar epithelium and basement membranes, including intra-alveolar neutrophils and fibrin on the alveolar surface and intravascular fibrin (microthrombosis). CONCLUSIONS In this particular porcine model, the nonimmunogenic polymer SPA caused a rapid exudative lung injury. This model may be useful to study ARDS caused by epithelial injury and inflammation.","Henderson, William R; Barnbrook, Julian; Dominelli, Paolo B; Griesdale, Donald Eg; Arndt, Tara; Molgat-Seon, Yannick; Foster, Glen; Ackland, Gareth L; Xu, James; Ayas, Najib T; Sheel, Andrew W",Intensive care medicine experimental,121,17

We implemented a standardized telephone outreach process targeting patients without active electronic portal accounts to improve remote symptom monitoring. Outreach resulted in 172 completed screens, identifying 110 needs for 63 individuals. Twenty-eight patients completed patient portal enrollment. Outreach calls captured a higher percentage of Black patients (34%) and a higher percentage of 61-80 year olds (69%) compared to portal users.

We investigated the frequency and predictors of new CMBs that developed shortly after mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke, and its impact on clinical outcome.We retrospectively analyzed patients with large-vessel occlusion strokes treated with Merci Retriever, Penumbra System, or stent-retriever devices. Serial T2*-weighted gradient-recall echo (GRE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and 48 h after endovascular thrombectomy were assessed to identify new CMBs. We examined independent factors associated with new CMBs after mechanical thrombectomy. We analyzed the association of the presence, burden, and distribution of new CMBs with clinical outcome.A total of 187 consecutive patients with serial GRE were enrolled in this study. CMBs were evident in 36 (19.3%) patients before mechanical thrombectomy. New CMBs occurred in 41 (21.9%) patients after mechanical thrombectomy. Of the 68 new CMBs, 45 appeared in the lobar location, 18 in the deep location and 5 in the infratentorial location. The presence of baseline CMBs was associated with new CMBs after mechanical thrombectomy (OR 5.38; 95% CI 2.13-13.59; P < 0.001), no matter whether the patients were treated primarily with mechanical thrombectomy or with intravenous thrombolysis followed by mechanical thrombectomy. Patients with new CMBs did not have increased rates of hemorrhagic transformation, in-hospital mortality, and modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6 at discharge.New CMBs are common after mechanical thrombectomy in one-fifth of patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Apert syndrome and other syndromic craniofacial dysostoses are often characterized by hypertelorism, with a negative canthal axis and counterrotated orbits. Central midface hypoplasia can result in a biconcave face in both midsagittal and axial planes. Bipartition distraction can correct these facial abnormalities. METHODS Twenty patients (19 Apert syndrome patients and one Pfeiffer syndrome patient, aged 1.6 to 21 years) underwent bipartition distraction. Severity of appearance was graded preoperatively and postoperatively as mild, moderate, or severe. Functional problems were documented by a multidisciplinary team. Central and lateral midface skeletal advancement were measured. Follow-up ranged from 15 months to 7 years. RESULTS Bipartition distraction consistently produced more central than lateral facial advancement. Mean central advancement was 13.2 ± 5.9 mm at sella-nasion and 11.7 ± 5.4 mm at sella-A point. Lateral advancement was 4.7 ± 2.8 mm. Unbending the face improved aesthetic appearance. Airway function, eye exposure, and elevated intracranial pressure were improved. Complications included six temporary cerebrospinal fluid leaks (four needing a lumbar drain), five patients with postoperative seizures, five patients requiring Rigid External Distraction frame repositioning, one palatal fistula, one velopharyngeal incompetence, five pin-site infections, one abscess under frontal bone, three cases of sepsis, nine patients with worsened strabismus, two patients with enophthalmos, one patient with partial visual field loss, and three patients who required reintubation because of aspiration. CONCLUSIONS : Bipartition distraction is an effective procedure with which to differentially advance the central face in Apert syndrome. It improves both function and aesthetics.

This causal relationship is further complicated by the multi-level social determinants such as socio-political context, socio-economic factors and health systems. The systems approach has potential to facilitate understanding of such complex causal mechanisms. The objective of this paper is to describe the role of tobacco and alcohol use in the interaction of social determinants of NCDs in Nepal. METHOD The study adopted a qualitative study design guided by the Systemic Intervention methodology. The study involved key informant interviews (n = 63) and focus group discussions (n = 12) at different levels (national, district and/or community) and was informed by the adapted Social Determinants of Health Framework. The data analysis involved case study-based thematic analysis using framework approach and development of causal loop diagrams. The study also involved three sense-making sessions with key stakeholders. RESULTS Three key themes and causal loop diagrams emerged from the data analysis. Widespread availability of tobacco and alcohol products contributed to the use and addiction of tobacco and alcohol. Low focus on primary prevention by health systems and political influence of tobacco and alcohol industries were the major contributors to the problem. Gender and socio-economic status of families/communities were identified as key social determinants of tobacco and alcohol use. CONCLUSION Tobacco and alcohol use facilitated interaction of the social determinants of NCDs in the context of Nepal. Socio-economic status of families was both driver and outcome of tobacco and alcohol use. Health system actions to prevent NCDs were delayed mainly due to lack of system insights and commercial influence. A multi-sectoral response led by the health system is urgently needed.","Sharma, Sudesh Raj; Matheson, Anna; Lambrick, Danielle; Faulkner, James; Lounsbury, David W; Vaidya, Abhinav; Page, Rachel",BMC public health,121,27

The primary endpoint, radiologic hiatal hernia (HH) recurrence, was higher with PR (24%) than with SIS buttressed repair (9%) after 6 months. The second phase of this trial was designed to determine the long-term durability of biologic mesh-buttressed repair. METHODS We systematically searched for the 108 patients in phase I of this study to assess current clinical symptoms, quality of life (QOL) and determine ongoing durability of the repair by obtaining a follow-up upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) read by 2 radiologists blinded to treatment received. HH recurrence was defined as the greatest measured vertical height of stomach being at least 2 cm above the diaphragm. RESULTS At median follow-up of 58 months (range 42 to 78 mo), 10 patients had died, 26 patients were not found, 72 completed clinical follow-up (PR, n = 39; SIS, n = 33), and 60 repeated a UGI (PR, n = 34; SIS, n = 26). There were 20 patients (59%) with recurrent HH in the PR group and 14 patients (54%) with recurrent HH in the SIS group (p = 0.7). There was no statistically significant difference in relevant symptoms or QOL between patients undergoing PR and SIS buttressed repair. There were no strictures, erosions, dysphagia, or other complications related to the use of SIS mesh. CONCLUSIONS LPEHR results in long and durable relief of symptoms and improvement in QOL with PR or SIS. There does not appear to be a higher rate of complications or side effects with biologic mesh, but its benefit in reducing HH recurrence diminishes at long-term follow-up (more than 5 years postoperatively) or earlier.","Oelschlager, Brant K; Pellegrini, Carlos A; Hunter, John G; Brunt, Michael L; Soper, Nathaniel J; Sheppard, Brett C; Polissar, Nayak L; Neradilek, Moni B; Mitsumori, Lee M; Rohrmann, Charles A; Swanstrom, Lee L",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,121,31

Our aim was to compare long-term results of percutaneous sonographically-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with high-powered microwave ablation (MWSA) in treatment of ICC. Methods: Results of 71 ICC patients with 98 nodules treated with RFA (36 patients) or MWSA (35 patients) between January 2008 and June 2018 in 5 Interventional Ultrasound centers of Southern Italy were retrospectively reviewed. Cumulative overall survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and differences with the log-rank test. Eleven possible factors affecting survival were analyzed. Results: Overall survival of the entire series was 88%, 65%, 45% and 34% at 12, 36, 60 and 80 months, respectively. Patients treated with MWSA survived longer than patients treated with RFA (p < 0.005). The MWSA group with ICC nodules ≤3 cm or nodules up to 4 cm survived longer than the RFA group (p < 0.0005). In patients with nodules >4 cm, no significant difference was found. Disease-free survival and progression-free survival were better in the MWSA group compared to the RFA group (p < 0.005). Diameter of nodules and MWSA were independent factors predicting a better survival. No major complications were observed. Conclusions: MWSA is superior to RFA in treating ICC unfit for surgery, achieving better long-term survival in small (≤3 cm) ICC nodules as well as nodules up to 4 cm of neoplastic tumors and should replace RFA.","Giorgio, Antonio; Gatti, Pietro; Montesarchio, Luca; Santoro, Bruno; Dell'Olio, Andrea; Crucinio, Nicola; Coppola, Carmine; Scarano, Ferdinando; Biase, Fabio De; Ciracì, Emanuela; Semeraro, Stefano; Giorgio, Valentina",Journal of clinical and translational hepatology,121,7

Monofilament PP less frequently requires extraction in the setting of contamination compared to multifilament PET mesh. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the clinical outcomes of ventral hernia repair with PP and PET mesh. Patients and methods A comprehensive literature search was performed using the Ovid search platform. Criteria included ventral hernia repair publications using either PP or PET mesh with a minimum follow-up duration of one year. Included studies were subject to data extraction including mesh position, weight, recurrence rates, infection, and complications. Random effect meta-analysis was run to provide pooled event rate and 95% CI. Results Ninety-seven studies including a total of 10,022 patients were included in the final analysis. Hernia recurrence rates are similar (4.8%, 95% CI [3.5-6.5] vs 4.7%, 95% CI [3.7-6.0]) as well as mesh infection rates (3.5%, 95% CI [2.5-4.9] vs 5.0%, 95% CI [3.9-6.3]) between PET and PP, respectively. Mesh infections occurred less frequently in laparoscopic repair compared to open (1.6%, 95% CI [0.9-2.6] vs 5.2%, 95% CI [4.3-6.3]). Conclusion This study suggests that mesh material does not affect recurrence or infection in ventral hernia repair and that surgery can be safely performed with both PP and PET mesh. A laparoscopic approach is associated with a decreased infection rate compared to open repair independent of mesh type.","Totten, Crystal; Becker, Patrice; Lourd, Mathilde; Roth, J Scott",Medical devices,121,1

We then turn to the first of three aerographic themes where air becomes a matter of grasping and visualising otherwise invisible airborne infections. This includes imagining patients located within bodily spheres or 'cloud bodies', conceptually anchored in Irigaray's thoughts on the 'forgetting of the air' and Sloterdijk's immunitary 'spherology' of the body. Our second theme explores the material politics of air, air conditioning, window design and the way competing 'air regimes' come into conflict with each other at the interface of buildings, bodies and the biotic. Our final theme attends to the 'cost of air', the aero-economic problem of atmospheric scarcity within modern high-rise, deep-density healthcare architectures.","Brown, Nik; Buse, Chrissy; Lewis, Alan; Martin, Daryl; Nettleton, Sarah",Sociology of health & illness,121,1

Augmented Reality simulators retain the benefit of realistic haptic feedback and additionally generate objective assessment and informative feedback during the training. This study researched the performance curve of the adapted suturing module on the ProMIS Augmented Reality simulator. METHODS Eighteen novice participants were pretrained on the MIST-VR to become acquainted with laparoscopy. Subsequently, they practiced 16 knots on the suturing module, of which the assessment scores were recorded to evaluate the gain in laparoscopic suturing skills. The scoring of the assessment method was calculated from the ""time spent in the correct area"" during the knot tying and the quality of the knot. Both the baseline knot and the knot at the top of the performance curve were assessed by two independent objective observers, by means of a standardized evaluation form, to objectify the gain in suturing skills. RESULTS There was a statistically significant difference between the scores of the second knot (mean 72.59, standard deviation (SD) 16.28) and the top of the performance curve (mean 95.82, SD 3.05; p < 0.001, paired t-test). The scoring of the objective observers also differed significantly (mean 11.83 and 22.11, respectively; SD 3.37 and 3.89, respectively; p < 0.001) (interobserver reliability Cronbach's alpha = 0.96). The median amount of repetitions to reach the top of the performance curve was eight, which also showed significant differences between both the assessment score (mean 88.14, SD 13.53, p < 0.001) and scoring of the objective observers of the second knot (mean 20.51, SD 4.14; p < 0.001).

We also examine the cosmetic outcome, safety, and utility of the procedure. Material and methods Between February 2010 and October 2016, 54 patients who underwent single- or multiple-port laparoscopic or open lateral segmentectomy (LS) were retrospectively analyzed with respect to cosmetic outcome, safety, and utility. Results In the single LLS group, the laparoscopic procedure was successfully completed for all 14 patients. The median operative time was significantly shorter in the single LLS group (123 min; range: 50-270 min) than in the other groups. Estimated blood loss was also significantly lower in the single LLS group (10 ml; range: 0-330 ml). During the first 7 postoperative days, the visual analog scale pain score and the use of additional analgesia were not significantly different between groups.

METHODS We assessed reported time outdoors (min/day), light exposure patterns and outdoor activities of children aged 9 years (n=483) with a questionnaire, the FitSight watch and a 7-day activity diary. Light levels, the duration, timing and frequency of light exposure were assessed. Cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE), myopia (SE≤-0.5 D) and axial length (AL) of paired eyes were analysed using generalised estimating equations. RESULTS In this study, 483 (966 eyes) multiethnic children (50.0% boys, 59.8% Chinese, 42.2% myopic) were included. Reported time outdoors (mean±SD) was 100±93 min/day, and average light levels were 458±228 lux. Of the total duration children spent at light levels of ≥1000 lux (37±19 min/day), 76% were spent below 5000 lux. Peak light exposure occurred at mid-day. Children had 1.7±1.0 light exposure episodes/day. Common outdoor activities were walks, neighbourhood play and swimming. Greater reported time outdoors was associated with lower odds of myopia (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.95/hour increase daily; p=0.009). Light levels, timing and frequency of light exposures were not associated with myopia, SE or AL (p>0.05). CONCLUSION Reported time outdoors, light levels and number of light exposure episodes were low among Singaporean children aged 9 years.

Saturation genome editing (SGE) was recently reported as an innovative laboratory-based approach to assess the pathogenicity of BRCA1 variants. We combined clinical phenotypes and SGE score to identify the pathogenicity of BRCA1 VUSs detected in a cohort of 8,085 breast cancer patients. According to SGE function score, 33 out of 144 BRCA1 VUSs detected were classified into ""loss of function"" (n = 13), ""intermediate"" (n = 2), and ""functional"" (n = 18) groups. Compared with non-carriers, ""loss of function"" VUS carriers (n = 19) presented significantly worse clinicopathological characteristics. These included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis (44.4 years vs. 51.2 years, P = 0.01), stronger family history of any cancer (57.9% vs. 32.3%, P = 0.017) especially breast or ovarian cancer (47.4% vs. 9.3%, P < 0.001), more bilateral breast cancer (31.6% vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001), and triple-negative breast cancer (47.4% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001), which were comparable to those of pathogenic variant carriers. In contrast, the clinical phenotypes of ""functional"" VUS carriers were similar to those of non-carriers. These results indicated that SGE was a reliable method in BRCA1 variant classification. Combining SGE function score and the available evidence, twelve out of 33 BRCA1 VUSs were reclassified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and one was benign.","Wan, Qiting; Hu, Li; Ouyang, Tao; Li, Jinfeng; Wang, Tianfeng; Fan, Zhaoqing; Fan, Tie; Lin, Benyao; Xu, Ye; Xie, Yuntao",Familial cancer,121,1

However, controversy exists regarding the best method of training this characteristic. This study sought to determine the most effective core training method to enhance distal limb athleticism. A total of 12 participants (24 ± 3 years, 1.8 ± 0.05 m, 76.8 ± 9.7 kg) consisting of Muay Thai athletes performed a core training protocol (Isometric vs. Dynamic, with Control) for 6 weeks, using a repeated measures design to assess performance (peak strike velocity, peak impact force, muscular activation) in various strikes. Isometric training increased impact force in Jab (554.4 ± 70.1 N), Cross (1895.2 ± 203.1 N), Combo (616.8 ± 54.9 N), and Knee (1240.0 ± 89.1 N) trials (P < 0.05). Dynamic training increased strike velocity in Jab (1.3 ± 0.2 m · s-1), Cross (5.5 ± 0.9 m · s-1), Combo (0.7 ± 0.1, 2.8 ± 0.3 m · s-1), and Knee (3.2 ± 0.3 m · s-1) trials (P < 0.05). Isometric training increased Combo impact force 935.1 ± 100.3 N greater than Dynamic and 931.6 ± 108.5 N more than Control (P < 0.05). Dynamic training increased Jab strike velocity 1.3 ± 0.1 m · s-1 greater than Isometric and 0.8 ± 0.1 m · s-1 more than Control (P < 0.05). It appears that both static and dynamic approaches to core training are needed to enhance both velocity and force in distal limbs.","Lee, Benjamin; McGill, Stuart",Journal of sports sciences,121,1

We examined factors associated with final malignant pathology and evaluated the postoperative course of patients with DA versus pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed patients with DA who underwent PD from 2008 to 2018 and assessed the accuracy rate of preoperative biopsy and factors associated with final malignant pathology. Complications for DA patients were compared with those of matched PDAC patients. RESULTS Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent PD for DA were identified, and the preoperative biopsy false negative rate was 29. Factors associated with final malignant pathology included age over 70 years, preoperative biliary obstruction, and common bile duct diameter > 8 mm (p < 0.05). Compared with patients with PDAC (n = 302), DA patients experienced more major complications (31% vs. 15%, p < 0.01), more grade C postoperative pancreatic fistulas (9% vs. 1%, p < 0.01), and greater mortality (7% vs. 2%, p < 0.05). Propensity score matched patients with DA had more major complications following PD (32% vs. 12%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative biopsy of duodenal adenomas is associated with a high false-negative rate for malignancy, and PD for DA is associated with higher complication rates than PD for PDAC. These results aid discussion among patients and surgeons who are considering observation versus PD for DA, especially in younger patients without biliary obstruction, who are less likely to harbor malignancy.","Eng, Nina L; Mustin, Danielle E; Lovasik, Brendan P; Turgeon, Michael K; Gamboa, Adriana C; Shah, Mihir M; Cardona, Kenneth; Sarmiento, Juan M; Russell, Maria C; Maithel, Shishir K; Switchenko, Jeffrey M; Kooby, David A",Annals of surgical oncology,121,1

OBJECTIVE To identify notable factors that affect outcome, revascularization, and complications in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with the Solitaire Flow Restoration Revascularization device. METHODS Eighty-nine patients treated with the Solitaire Flow Restoration Revascularization device (ev3/Covidien Vascular Therapies, Irvine, California) were retrospectively analyzed. Three endpoints were considered: revascularization (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction), outcome (modified Rankin Scale score), and complications. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to determine significant predictors. RESULTS The mean time from onset of symptoms to the start of intervention was 6.7 hours. The average procedure length was 58 minutes. The mean NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 16 on arrival and 8 at discharge. Of the patients, 6.7% had a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, 16.8% had fatal outcomes within 3 months post-intervention, and 81.4% had a successful recanalization. Thrombus location in the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery was associated with successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b/3) (P = .003). Of the patients, 56.6% had a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months: 0-2). In patients younger than 80 years of age, 66.7% had favorable outcome. Increasing age (P = .01) and NIHSS score (P = .002) were significant predictors of a poor outcome. On multivariate analysis, NIHSS score on admission (P = .05) was a predictor of complications. On univariate analysis, increasing NIHSS score from admission to 24 hours after the procedure (P = .05) and then to discharge (P = .04) was a predictor of complications. Thrombus location in the posterior circulation (P = .04) and increasing NIHSS score (P = .04) predicted mortality. CONCLUSION The Solitaire device is safe and effective in achieving successful recanalization after acute ischemic stroke. Important factors to consider include age, NIHSS score, and location.","Daou, Badih; Chalouhi, Nohra; Starke, Robert M; Dalyai, Richard; Hentschel, Kate; Jabbour, Pascal; Rosenwasser, Robert; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I",Neurosurgery,121,29

In continuation of our efforts in identifying the new small molecule antiviral and anticancer agents, we identified chalcones as potent antiviral and anticancer agents. OBJECTIVE With the aim of identifying the broad acting antiviral and anticancer agents, we discovered substituted aryl/heteroaryl derived thienyl chalcones as antiviral and anticancer agents. METHOD A focused set of thienyl chalcone derivaties II-VI was screened for selected viruses Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Dengue virus 2 (DENV2), Influenza A (H1N1) virus, MERS coronavirus, Poliovirus 1 (PV 1), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Tacaribe virus (TCRV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) and Zika virus (ZIKV) using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) antiviral screening program. Additionally, a cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has been screened for 60 human cancer cell lines using the Development Therapeutics Program (DTP) of NCI. RESULTS All thienyl chalcone derivatives II-VI displayed moderate to excellent antiviral activity towards several viruses tested. Compounds V and VI were turned out be active compounds towards human cytomegalovirus for both normal strain (AD169) as well as resistant isolate (GDGr K17). Particularly, cyano derivative V showed very high potency (EC50: <0.05 µM) towards AD169 strain of HCMV compared to standard drug Ganciclovir (EC50: 0.12 µM). Additionally, it showed moderate activity in the secondary assay (AD169; EC50: 2.30 µM). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV displayed high potency towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Tacaribe virus (TCRV) towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV is nearly 28 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: 0.39 µg/ml) and nearly 17 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: 0.71 μg/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 11 µg/ml; visual assay and EC50: 12 µg/ml; neutral red assay). It is nearly 12 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: >1 µg/ml) and nearly 8 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: >1.3 µg/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 12 µg/ml; visual assay and EC50: 9.9 µg/ml; neutral red assay) towards Tacaribe virus (TCRV). Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has shown strong growth inhibitory activity towards three major cancers (colon, breast, and leukemia) cell lines and moderate growth inhibition shown towards other cancer cell lines screened. CONCLUSION Compounds V and VI were demonstrated viral inhibition towards Human cytomegalovirus, whereas cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV towards Rift Valley fever virus and Tacaribe virus. Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has displayed very good cytotoxicity against colon, breast and leukemia cell lines in vitro.","Patil, Vikrant; Patil, Siddappa A; Patil, Renukadevi; Bugarin, Alejandro; Beaman, Kenneth; Patil, Shivaputra A",Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),121,28

METHODS In two phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, noninferiority trials, we compared vadadustat with the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) darbepoetin alfa in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD) not previously treated with an ESA who had a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g per deciliter and in patients with ESA-treated NDD-CKD and a hemoglobin concentration of 8 to 11 g per deciliter (in the United States) or 9 to 12 g per deciliter (in other countries). The primary safety end point, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was the first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), pooled across the two trials. Secondary safety end points included expanded MACE (MACE plus hospitalization for either heart failure or a thromboembolic event). The primary and key secondary efficacy end points in each trial were the mean change in hemoglobin concentration from baseline during two evaluation periods: weeks 24 through 36 and weeks 40 through 52. RESULTS A total of 1751 patients with ESA-untreated NDD-CKD and 1725 with ESA-treated NDD-CKD underwent randomization in the two trials. In the pooled analysis, in which 1739 patients received vadadustat and 1732 received darbepoetin alfa, the hazard ratio for MACE was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.36), which did not meet the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25. The mean between-group differences in the change in the hemoglobin concentration at weeks 24 through 36 were 0.05 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.04 to 0.15) in the trial involving ESA-untreated patients and -0.01 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.07) in the trial involving ESA-treated patients, which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.75 g per deciliter. CONCLUSIONS Vadadustat, as compared with darbepoetin alfa, met the prespecified noninferiority criterion for hematologic efficacy but not the prespecified noninferiority criterion for cardiovascular safety in patients with NDD-CKD.

However, little is known about specific gut microbiota composition and its correlated metabolites associated with molecular signatures underlying host response to infection. Here, we describe the construction of a proteomic risk score based on 20 blood proteomic biomarkers, which have recently been identified as molecular signatures predicting the progression of the COVID-19. We demonstrate that in our cohort of 990 healthy individuals without infection, this proteomic risk score is positively associated with proinflammatory cytokines mainly among older, but not younger, individuals. We further discover that a core set of gut microbiota can accurately predict the above proteomic biomarkers among 301 individuals using a machine learning model and that these gut microbiota features are highly correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in another independent set of 366 individuals. Fecal metabolomics analysis suggests potential amino acid-related pathways linking gut microbiota to host metabolism and inflammation. Overall, our multi-omics analyses suggest that gut microbiota composition and function are closely related to inflammation and molecular signatures of host response to infection among healthy individuals.

One of the favored current targets for the development of antiviral compounds is the active site of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, like many subcellular processes, replication of the genomes of all positive-strand RNA viruses occurs in highly oligomeric complexes on the cytosolic surfaces of the intracellular membranes of infected host cells. In this study, catalytically inactive polymerases were shown to participate productively in functional oligomer formation and catalysis, as assayed by RNA template elongation. Direct protein transduction to introduce either active or inactive polymerases into cells infected with mutant virus confirmed the structural role for polymerase molecules during infection. Therefore, we suggest that targeting the active sites of polymerase molecules is not likely to be the best antiviral strategy, as inactivated polymerases do not inhibit replication of other viruses in the same cell and can, in fact, be useful in RNA replication complexes. On the other hand, polymerases that could not participate in functional RNA replication complexes were those that contained mutations in the amino terminus, leading to altered contacts in the folded polymerase and mutations in a known polymerase-polymerase interaction in the two-dimensional protein lattice. Thus, the functional nature of multimeric arrays of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase supplies a novel target for antiviral compounds and provides a new appreciation for enzymatic catalysis on membranous surfaces within cells.","Spagnolo, Jeannie F; Rossignol, Evan; Bullitt, Esther; Kirkegaard, Karla",RNA,121,16

METHODS The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (January 1999 to March 2010) were reviewed. A total of 17 series representing 1,167 cases were selected. RESULTS The mean patient age was 51.8 years, and 42.8% of the patients were men. The most common indication for reoperation was recurrent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the most common etiology of failure was herniation of the wrap. The mean operative time was 172 min, and the mean hospital stay was 2.8 days. Intraoperative complications occurred in 18.6% of cases, and the most common complication was gastrointestinal perforations (14.2%). The rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery was 7.4%. The average postoperative follow-up period was 18 months. Postoperative complications were encountered with 16.9% of the patients, and the most common categorized complication was incisional hernia (1.6%). Success rates, defined variably, averaged 81%. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrates that although technically challenging, redo laparoscopic fundoplication can be an effective tool in the operative management of clinically significant problems after primary fundoplication.","van Beek, Darren B; Auyang, Edward D; Soper, Nathaniel J",Surgical endoscopy,121,1

Assessment of postoperative air leakage was performed until chest tube removal. Patients were followed until 30 days after discharge. At end of surgery, 100% in the PSG and 0% in the CG were air leak free (p < 0.001). Duration of postoperative chest tube suction was shorter in PSG (p < 0.001), and air leak chest tube was removed earlier (p = 0.03). Limitation for chest tube removal due to a pulmonary leak was 35% in CG and 5% in PSG (p = 0.04). Patients remaining air leak free thru discharge was 95% and 15% for PSG and CG (p < 0.001). The study demonstrated a superior efficacy of PleuraSeal sealant compared with standard surgical treatment for sustained sealing of postoperative air leakage and causes shorter air leak chest tube duration.","Dango, Sebastian; Lin, Rong; Hennings, Ellen; Passlick, Bernward",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,121,1

Seemingly healthy imported camels are responsible for the ingress of serious diseases into Egypt. A striking example of this concerning public health globally is the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which causes case fatalities of over 34%. Here, we determined the seroepidemiological situation of the MERS-CoV in imported camels and their traders in Upper Egypt. METHODOLOGY Sera of sixty-three dromedaries and twenty-eight camel traders were recruited (January 2015-December 2016). The age, gender, and sampling locality of each sampled camel and human were obtained. Semi-quantitative anti-MERS-CoV IgG ELISAs which utilize the purified spike protein domain S1 antigen of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV S1) were used to detect specific IgG antibodies against the virus. RESULTS The data showed that 58.73% of imported camels and 25% of traders had antibodies specific to MERS-CoV. Interestingly, like seroreactive camels, all seropositive humans were apparently healthy without any history of developing severe respiratory disease in the 14 days prior to sampling. Having specific antibodies among the examined camel sera was significantly different (P < 0.0001) in relation to various sampling localities, gender and age groups. In contrast, the seropositivity rate of MERS-CoV IgG in humans did not differ significantly by any of the studied factors. CONCLUSIONS The current study provides the first serological evidence of occupational exposure of humans to MERS-CoV in Africa. Additionally, it reports that imported camels could be implicated in introducing MERS-CoV into Egypt. Accordingly, application of strict control measures to camel importation is a priority.","Sayed, Amal Sm; Malek, Safaa S; Abushahba, Mostafa Fn",Journal of infection in developing countries,121,1

Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values produced from April 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021, were compared with national COVID-19 confirmed cases notifications according to their geographical and time distribution. These Ct values were evaluated against both a phase diagram predicting the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and an age-structured model estimating COVID-19 prevalence in Belgium. Results: Over 155,811 RT-PCR performed, 12,799 were positive and 7,910 Ct values were available for analysis. The 14-day median Ct values were negatively correlated with the 14-day mean daily positive tests with a lag of 17 days. In addition, the 14-day mean daily positive tests in LHUB-ULB were strongly correlated with the 14-day mean confirmed cases in the Brussels-Capital and in Belgium with coinciding start, peak and end of the different waves of the epidemic. Ct values decreased concurrently with the forecasted phase-shifts of the diagram. Similarly, the evolution of 14-day median Ct values was negatively correlated with daily estimated prevalence for all age-classes. Conclusion: We provide preliminary evidence that trends of Ct values can help to both follow and predict the epidemic's trajectory at local and national levels, underlining that consolidated microbiology laboratories can act as epidemic sensors as they gather data that are representative of the geographical area they serve.","Yin, N.; Dellicour, S.; Daubie, V.; Franco, N.; Wautier, M.; Faes, C.; Van Cauteren, D.; Nymark, L.; Hens, N.; Gilbert, M.; Hallin, M.; Vandenberg, O.",,121,20

No difference in occipital GABA+ or Glx concentrations, nor in the GABA+/Glx ratio, was found between groups. An analysis of an extended MDD patient and unmatched control dataset (n = 90) found no correlation between metabolite concentrations and depressive symptoms. These results were integrated with prior studies through metabolite-specific meta-analyses, revealing no difference in occipital GABA and Glx concentrations between patients and controls. An effect of publication year on GABA group differences was found, suggesting that previously reported results may have been artifacts of measurement accuracy.

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine(HCQ) could prevent SARS CoV-2 in healthcare workers(HCW) at high-risk of exposure. Method: This voluntary observational study for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was conducted at a tertiary care center, from 12th June to 12th October 2020(total 16 weeks). All consented asymptomatic HCWs of CIMS hospital were administered 400 mg HCQ twice a day on day one followed by 400 mg once weekly to be taken with meals up to 16 weeks. Data collected included OPD registration, risk assessment, medical and family history (related to COVID), physical examination and vitals, pulse oximetry, ECG (pre and post HCQ), drug adherence, side effects, adverse drug reactions. Result: The study enrolled 927 full-time, hospital-based HCWs ((including doctors, nurses, paramedical, lab technicians, sanitary workers and others), of whom 731(78.85%) initially started HCQ while 196 (21.14%) did not volunteer. The median age and weight of the study population was 27.5 years and 69.5 kg respectively. No major associated co-morbidities were present in these HCWs. There was an increased trend towards non adherence to HCQ with each proceeding week more so after week 11. Of the 731 HCWs taking HCQ a total of 167(22.8%) tested COVID positive at different intervals of time as against 30 HCW (15.3%) out of 196 not taking HCQ. The rate of COVID-19 positive was statistically significantly higher in the HCWs taking HCQ (p=0.0220; 95% CI: 1.14% to 12.94%), as compared to those not on HCQ. Thus HCQ was not prophylactically effective against COVID 19 infection. No participants in this study experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events. No significant difference in the median of ECG changes in QTc between pre and post HCQ administration of 46 HCWs was observed. Conclusions: This clinical study did not detect a reduction in SARS CoV-2 transmission with prophylactic administration of 400 mg/HCQ in HCWs. All participants who did contract SARSCoV-2 were either asymptomatic or had mild disease courses with full recoveries. All adverse events were self-limiting and no serious cardiovascular events were reported with use of HCQ. In the absence of robust data, it seems premature to recommend HCQ as a prophylactic panacea for COVID-19.","Bhatt, P.; Patel, V.; Shah, P.; Parikh, K.",,121,16

The current research examines COVID-19-related self-interest bias from a cross-cultural perspective.

Long cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is recognized by MDA5. The ATPase activity of MDA5 contributes to its dsRNA binding selectivity. Mutations that reduce RNA selectivity can cause autoimmune disease. Here, we show how the disease-associated MDA5 variant M854K perturbs MDA5-dsRNA recognition. M854K MDA5 constitutively activates interferon signaling in the absence of exogenous RNA. M854K MDA5 lacks ATPase activity and binds more tightly to synthetic Alu:Alu dsRNA. CryoEM structures MDA5-dsRNA filaments at different stages of ATP hydrolysis show that the K854 side-chain forms polar bonds that constrain the conformation of MDA5 subdomains, disrupting key steps in the ATPase cycle-RNA footprint expansion and helical twist modulation. The M854K mutation inhibits ATP-dependent RNA proofreading via a novel allosteric mechanism, allowing MDA5 to form signaling complexes on endogenous RNAs.

Such measures may also impact the spread of other pathogens, including influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with implications for future annual epidemics and expectations for the subsequent northern hemisphere winter. Methods We assessed the detection of influenza and RSV through facility-based syndromic surveillance of adults and children with mild or severe respiratory illness in South Africa from January to October 2020, and compared this with surveillance data from 2013 to 2019. Results Facility-based surveillance revealed a decline in influenza virus detection during the regular season compared with previous years. This was observed throughout the implementation of COVID-19 control measures. RSV detection decreased soon after the most stringent COVID-19 control measures commenced;however, an increase in RSV detection was observed after the typical season, following the reopening of schools and the easing of measures. Conclusion COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions led to reduced circulation of influenza and RSV in South Africa. This has limited the country's ability to provide influenza virus strains for the selection of the annual influenza vaccine. Delayed increases in RSV case numbers may reflect the easing of COVID-19 control measures. An increase in influenza virus detection was not observed, suggesting that the measures may have impacted the two pathogens differently. The impact that lowered and/or delayed influenza and RSV circulation in 2020 will have on the intensity and severity of subsequent annual epidemics is unknown and warrants close monitoring.","Tempia, S.; Walaza, S.; Bhiman, J.

To ensure the intended surface quality falls within tolerances, the grinding wheel plays an important role as an abrasive tool. The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer. SEM micrographs are presented to understand the type of wear on the wheel surface. The outcome of present paper enables to understand and report the surface interactions quantified in terms of cutting, ploughing and rubbing whereas surface parameters are characterized as per ISO 25178.

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wildtype virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors - which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines - induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wildtype virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific T cells responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus as well as a hemagglutinin-specific T cell response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a several-fold enhancement of this immune response. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and of activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above hypothesis as well as suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.","Bloom, David C.; Tran, Robert K.; Feller, Joyce; Voellmy, Richard",bioRxiv,121,1

The trends and characteristics of air pollutant concentrations, especially PM2.5, ozone, and related substances, over the past 30 years, are analyzed, and the relationships between concentrations and emissions are discussed quantitatively. We found that PM2.5 mass concentrations have decreased, with the largest reduction in elemental carbon (EC) as the PM2.5 component. The concentrations of organic carbon (OC) have not changed significantly compared to other components, suggesting that especially VOC emissions as precursors need to be reduced. In addition, the analysis of the differences in PM2.5 concentrations between the ambient and the roadside showed that further research on non-exhaust particles is needed. For NOx and SO2, there is a linear relationship between domestic anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric concentrations, indicating that emission control measures are directly effective in the reduction in concentrations. Also, recent air pollution episodes and the effect of reduced economic activity, as a consequence of COVID-19, on air pollution concentrations are summarized.

First detected in October 2020, it has now spread to more than 100 countries, prompting WHO to declare it as a global variant of concern (VOC). The Delta (B.1.617.2), Delta plus (B.1.617.2.1) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) variants are all sub-lineages of the original B.1.617 variant. Prior to the inception of B.1.617, vaccine rollout, safe-distancing and timely lockdowns greatly reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, the Delta variant, allegedly more infectious and for which existing vaccines seemed less effective, has catalyzed the resurgence of cases. Therefore, there is an imperative need for increased surveillance of the B.1.617 variants. Efforts have been made to utilize wastewater-based surveillance for community-based tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants, however wastewater with its low SARS-CoV-2 viral titers and mixtures of viral variants, requires assays to be variant-specific yet accurately quantitative for meaningful interpretation. Following on the design principles of our previous assays for the Alpha variant, here we report allele-specific RT-qPCR assays targeting mutations T19R, D80A, K417N, T478K and E484Q, for quantitative detection and discrimination of the Delta, Delta plus, Kappa and Beta variants in wastewater. This method is open-sourced and can be implemented using commercially available RT-qPCR protocols, and would be an important tool for tracking the spread of B.1.617 and the Beta variants in communities.","Lee, W.

The subject of the study was their attitude towards remote psychotherapy in a situation of social isolation, which forced them to conduct therapy sessions remotely. The study also looked at the perception of difficulties and advantages of remote psychotherapy and changes in the therapist-client contact in such therapy. Methods: The research was conducted in the form of an online questionnaire sent by e-mail and posted on the profiles of thematic groups on the Facebook platform. Results: The vast majority of respondents continued psychotherapy during social isolation, despite the fact that most of them had not had contact with this form of therapeutic work before. The most frequently chosen method of holding sessions by both psychotherapists and clients was contact via an audio-video connection, less often by telephone. The greatest difficulty indicated in both of these forms was the lack of direct contact with the interlocutor. However, psychotherapists pointed out that remote psychotherapy may be more convenient for the client than traditionally conducted in direct contact. Most of the respondents agreed with the statement that during social isolation they became convinced about remote psychotherapy, although they do not consider it to be a better form than the traditional one. Conclusions: Social isolation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus forced a sudden change in the form of psychotherapeutic work in Poland, for which most of its participants were not prepared. The results showing the most important limitations and advantages of remote psychotherapy may be a guide to educating future generations of psychotherapists, who - as the current situation shows - must also be prepared for the form of remote assistance.","Kluzowicz, J.; Kluzowicz, M.",Psychoterapia,121,24

Despite the rise in fierce competition over the years, official global competitiveness rankings do not always reflect this changed performance, likely because they were designed in a Western context, and do not capture the nuances attributed to cultural differences – amongst other factors – that shape their competitiveness. Though it is crucial to explore contributing factors such as education and role of institutions, culture, operating practices and policies as some determinants, our interest in furthering the CP narrative is to push the boundaries and entertain novel theories that are interdisciplinary, or not usually found in the literature, especially in the domain of cross-cultural and strategic management. Competitiveness and productivity research in business and management, and related disciplines, is not new, yet warrants ongoing investigation because the tides of global activity are constantly changing, and the newly introduced CP paradigm combining competitiveness and productivity warrants empirical verification and theoretical probing.","Baumann, Chris Cherry Michael Chu Wujin Cummings Lorne Viengkham Doris Hume Winzar",Cross Cultural & Strategic Management,121,16

Currently, there is no specific treatment or immunisation for COVID-19. This virus spreads by droplets coming into contact with body fluids. To prevent the virus from infecting others, people should take various precautionary measures. The public health lessons were: (1) System planning for pandemics depends on the participation of all sectors involved. This includes family doctors, hospital staff, and public health experts, (2) Communication from a trusted source is important, especially for a wide variety of audiences. It should be coordinated so that it does not conflict with others and should be clear in its message, (3) A regular update is needed to keep the public informed about the latest developments in the pandemic. It can help build confidence in the management of the disease and its spread, (4) Health care systems typically operate at full capacity all the time. The challenge is to sustain these services while protecting core functions, (5) Protect health care workers from SARS: The individuals who provide medical care need to be very careful about their work conditions. Proper equipment and supplies are necessary to prevent the spread of SARS, (6) Getting the right care at the right time can help minimize spread of respiratory illnesses, and (7) A family doctor noted that managing a pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint.

This cost is even greater in the context of large-scale additive manufacturing where the objects can be very large. As a result, a great deal of research has focused on defect identification and mitigation. To address defects during object construction, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated an in-situ control system comprised of two sensors: a thermal camera and laser profilometer. This control system adjusted material flow and build speed to mitigate three types of defects: low layer times, underfill, and overfill. Several test objects were constructed. The control system was found to adjust build parameters to handle low layer times of approximately 15 seconds and height deviations from -100% underfill (the absence of a layer) to 50% overfill. Within two layers, height deviations could be returned to within 10% of the expected layer height. Further, preliminary results suggest the system can compensate for uneven build surfaces.","Borish, Michael; Post, Brian K.; Roschli, Alex; Chesser, Phillip C.; Love, Lonnie J.",Procedia Manufacturing,121,10

One way to maximize compliance with this recommendation is through an automatic system that can recognize in real time whether a person is correctly using the corresponding PPE. This work presents the design, implementation and performance analysis of a system for recognizing the use of masks from image sequences, with the ability to operate in real time. Based on a generic object detection network, a training scheme is proposed for a detector of faces with masks and faces without masks, wherewith an average detection accuracy higher than 90% is obtained. This accuracy can be improved by using a network with a greater number of parameters, but with a longer computation time. The performance of the detector is validated with video sequences of people with and without facemasks, captured in different environments.","Dondo, D. G.; Redolfi, J. A.; Garcia, D.; Araguas, R.

This study investigated these dimensions for international business students studying in Australia to inform international HE policy and marketing. Qualitative research identified the main impacts: financial hardship and income loss, social and lifestyle changes, cessation of travel, and mental health concerns. Six COVID-19 intervention dimensions were identified and a survey then captured ratings of importance, as well as the performance of CDU and the government across these dimensions. Intervention improvement priorities varied according to the analytical approach used. For example, importance-performance analysis revealed financial support as the priority for improvement. In contrast, regression analysis revealed social distancing as the key driver of intervention satisfaction. Closing the loop research then revealed ways to improve COVID-19 interventions and provided input for future marketing for attracting and maintaining international students. Implications for measuring student satisfaction are also discussed.

However, the immunological mechanisms defining effective lung tissue protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection remain elusive. Unlike mice solely engrafted with human fetal lung xenograft (fLX), mice co-engrafted with fLX and a myeloid-enhanced human immune system (HNFL mice) are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe inflammation, and histopathology. Effective control of viral infection in HNFL mice associated with significant macrophage infiltration, and the induction of a potent macrophage-mediated interferon response. The pronounced upregulation of the USP18-ISG15 axis (a negative regulator of IFN responses), by macrophages was unique to HNFL mice and represented a prominent correlate of reduced inflammation and histopathology.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced an unparalleled level of doubt regarding the kind of mega-events that will take place in the coming years. While the 2019 call for papers could not predict such a radical shock, this special issue arrives at a quite unique moment of reflection. Prior to 2020, cities were already questioning the traditional format of mega-events (e.g. Olympics and Expo) while other cultural mega-events have been spreading and gaining popularity, thanks in part to typically lower costs of infrastructures and venues, far more adaptable arrangements, spatial distribution and time frame for hosting. In these ways, they have already been demonstrating higher flexibility in which to respond to future health and safety constraints. When it comes to the relation to the existing city, cultural mega-events have been planned, implemented and studied far more than any other. By leveraging the richness of cultural mega-events, this special issue deepens the intersection between events and cultural heritage in particular. This introduction provides a theoretical framework that cuts across mega-event and heritage research fields. It introduces the questions and approaches of the following contributions, arguing that the nexus between mega-events and heritage is a key challenge for many cities in Europe and beyond.

Objectives: To assess whether rs35705950-T confers differential risk for clinical outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection among participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI). Methods: MVP participants were examined for an association between the incidence or severity of COVID-19 and the presence of a MUC5B rs35705950-T allele. Comorbidities and clinical events were extracted from the electronic health records (EHR). The analysis was performed within each ancestry group in the MVP, adjusting for sex, age, age2, and first twenty principal components followed by a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We then pursued replication and performed a meta-analysis with the trans-ethnic summary statistics from the HGI. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of the rs35705950-T was conducted to explore associated pathophysiologic conditions. Measurements and Main Results: A COVID-19 severity scale was modified from the World Health Organization criteria, and phenotypes derived from the International Classification of Disease-9/10 were extracted from EHR. Presence of rs35705950-T was associated with fewer hospitalizations (Ncases=25353, Ncontrols=631,024; OR=0.86 [0.80-0.93], p=7.4 x 10-5) in trans-ethnic meta-analysis within MVP and joint meta-analyses with the HGI (N=1641311; OR=0.89 [0.85-0.93], p =1.9 x 10-6). Moreover, individuals of European Ancestry with at least one copy of rs35705950-T had fewer post-COVID-19 pneumonia events (OR=0.85 [0.76-0.96], p =0.008).

Here, we demonstrate that strains harboring the mof4-1 allele inactivated the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. The MOF4 gene was shown to be allelic to UPF1, a gene whose product is involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Although cells harboring the mof4-1 allele of the UPF1 gene lose the M1 virus, mutations in other UPF genes involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay maintain the M1 virus. The mof4-1 strain is more sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin than a upf1 delta strain, and frameshifting efficiency increases in a mof4-1 strain grown in the presence of this drug. Further, the ifs1 and ifs2 alleles previously identified as mutations that enhance frameshifting were shown to be allelic to the UPF2 and UPF1 genes, respectively, and both ifs strains maintained M1. These results indicate that mof4-1 is a unique allele of the UPF1 gene and that the gene product of the mof4-1 allele affects both -1 ribosomal frameshifting and mRNA turnover.","Cui, Y; Dinman, J D; Peltz, S W",EMBO J,121,24

Patients were monitored during the first two postoperative hours to establish their AHI (apnea hypopnea index, the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour). Nine patients were excluded (4 in group A and 5 in group C) due to technical problems or refusal. Interestingly, premedication by alprazolam did not change intra-operative propofol requirements. During the first two postoperative hours, the AHI was significantly higher in group A than in group C (Group A: 20.33 ± 10.97 h-1, C: 9.63 ± 4.67 h-1). These apneas did not induce significant arterial oxygen desaturation, or mandibular instability. Our study demonstrates that a premedication with 0.5 mg of alprazolam doesn't modify intra-operative anesthetic requirements during colonoscopy, but is associated with a higher rate of obstructive apneas during at least three and a half hours after ingestion. No severe side effects were observed in our non-obese population. Our results must be confirmed on a larger scale.","Deflandre, E; Bonhomme, V; Courtois, A-C; Degey, S; Poirrier, R; Brichant, J-F",Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,121,28

This heterogeneous disorder has numerous pulmonary and non-pulmonary causes and is associated with a significant risk of mortality. Many supportive therapies exist for ARDS. SEARCH: Literature search was performed by using the key words ARDS and related topics on the Pubmed search engine maintained by the National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute. Pediatric randomized controlled trials that have been published in the last 10 years were included. Emphasis was placed on pediatric literature, although sentinel adult studies have been included. Most of the evidence presented is of levels I and II. RESULTS Low tidal volume is the only strategy that has consistently improved outcome in ARDS. A tidal volume of ≤ 6 mL/kg predicted body weight should be used. Ventilator induced lung injury may result in systemic effects with multi-system organ failure, and all efforts should be made to minimize this. Positive end-expiratory pressure should be used to judiciously maintain lung recruitment. There is insufficient evidence to routinely use high frequency ventilation, prone positioning, or inhaled nitric oxide. Calfactant therapy is promising and may be considered in children with direct lung injury and ARDS. Current literature does not support routine use of corticosteroids for non-resolving ARDS.","Prabhakaran, Priya",Indian pediatrics,121,1

Isoforms expressing either two or four alternatively spliced Ig-like domains in mice have been found in a number of epithelial, endothelial, or hematopoietic tissues. CEACAM1a functions as an intercellular adhesion molecule, an angiogenic factor, and a tumor cell growth inhibitor. Moreover, the mouse and human CEACAM1a proteins are targets of viral or bacterial pathogens, respectively, including the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis, as well as Moraxella catarrhalis in humans. We have shown that targeted disruption of the Ceacam1a (MHVR) gene resulting in a partial ablation of the protein in mice (p/p mice) led to reduced susceptibility to MHV-A59 infection of the modified mice in the BALB/c background. We have now engineered and produced a Ceacam1a-/- mouse that exhibits complete ablation of the CEACAM1a protein in every tissue where it is normally expressed. We report that 3-week-old Ceacam1a-/- mice in the C57BL/6 genetic background are fully resistant to MHV-A59 infection by both intranasal and intracerebral routes. Whereas virus-inoculated wild-type +/+ C57BL/6 mice showed profound liver damage and spinal cord demyelination under these conditions, Ceacam1a-/- mice displayed normal livers and spinal cords. Virus was recovered from liver and spinal cord tissues of +/+ mice but not of -/- mice. These results indicate that CEACAM1a is the sole receptor for MHV-A59 in both liver and brain and that its deletion from the mouse renders the mouse completely resistant to infection by this virus.","Hemmila, Erin; Turbide, Claire; Olson, Melanie; Jothy, Serge; Holmes, Kathryn V; Beauchemin, Nicole",Journal of virology,121,23

The intention is to reduce postoperative morbidity and hernia recurrence, evaluate new treatment strategies, and facilitate nationwide implementation of evidence-based treatment strategies. This paper describes the design and purpose of DVHD. STUDY POPULATION Adult (≥18 years) patients with a Danish Civil Registration Number and undergoing surgery under elective or emergency conditions for ventral hernia in a Danish surgical department from 2007 and beyond. A total of 80% of all ventral hernia repairs performed in Denmark were reported to the DVHD. MAIN VARIABLES Demographic data (age, sex, and center), detailed hernia description (eg, type, size, surgical priority), and technical aspects (open/laparoscopic and mesh related factors) related to the surgical repair are recorded. Data registration is mandatory. Data may be merged with other Danish health registries and information from patient questionnaires or clinical examinations. DESCRIPTIVE DATA More than 37,000 operations have been registered. Data have demonstrated high agreement with patient files. The data allow technical proposals for surgical improvement with special emphasis on reduced incidences of postoperative complications, hernia recurrence, and chronic pain. CONCLUSION DVHD is a prospective and mandatory registration system for Danish surgeons. It has collected a high number of operations and is an excellent tool for observing changes over time, including adjustment of several confounders. This national database registry has impacted on clinical practice in Denmark and led to a high number of scientific publications in recent years.","Helgstrand, Frederik; Jorgensen, Lars Nannestad",Clinical epidemiology,121,16

Screening to detect potential SARS-infected subjects with elevated body temperature plays an important role in preventing the spread of SARS. Thermography is being used with ANN/AI to analyse the data collected from the designated SARS hospital in Singapore, and conclusive results are drawn. The current work evaluates the correlations (and classifications) between facial skin temperatures, including eye range and forehead, to aural temperature using a neural network (NN) approach, namely training backpropagation (BP) and Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), to confirm the suitability of thermal imagers for human temperature screening. Both BP and SOM can form an opinion about the type of network that is better able to complement thermogram technology in fever diagnosis. This can produce better parameters for reducing the size of the NN classifier, while maintaining good classification accuracy. We observe that BP performs better than SOM NN. Confusion matrix (CM), an alternative display instrument, is able to process a high volume of input data and show the clustered output rapidly and accurately. The current research application will remain an interesting and useful reference for both local and overseas manufacturers of thermal scanners, users and various government and private establishments. As the elevation of body temperature is a common presenting symptom for many illnesses, including infectious diseases such as SARS, thermal imagers are useful and essential tools for mass screening of body temperature. This is true not only for SARS but also during other public health crises where widespread transmission of infection such as the danger of avian flu pandemic is a concern, in particular at places like hospitals and cross-border checkpoints.","Ng, E Y K; Chong, C",Journal of medical engineering & technology,121,9

This ultrastructural analysis was focused on the identification of the different viral components that assemble in infected cells, in particular the spherical, potentially icosahedral internal core, a new structural element of the extracellular infectious coronavirus recently characterized by our group. Typical budding profiles and two types of virion-related particles were detected in TGEV-infected cells. While large virions with an electron-dense internal periphery and a clear central area are abundant at perinuclear regions, smaller viral particles, with the characteristic morphology of extracellular virions (exhibiting compact internal cores with polygonal contours) accumulate inside secretory vesicles that reach the plasma membrane. The two types of virions coexist in the Golgi complex of infected ST cells. In nocodazole-treated infected cells, the two types of virions coexist in altered Golgi stacks, while the large secretory vesicles filled with virions found in normal infections are not detected in this case. Treatment of infected cells with the Golgi complex-disrupting agent brefeldin A induced the accumulation of large virions in the cisternae that form by fusion of different membranous compartments. These data, together with the distribution of both types of virions in different cellular compartments, strongly suggest that the large virions are the precursors of the small viral particles and that their transport through a functional Golgi complex is necessary for viral maturation.","Risco, C; Muntión, M; Enjuanes, L; Carrascosa, J L",Journal of virology,121,16

We investigated the effect of a bio-occlusive umbilical vacuum dressing on wound infection rates after TULAA for patients with acute appendicitis and compared to it with a conventional 3-port appendectomy with a nonvacuum dressing. METHODS This study was a retrospective chart review of 1377 patients (2-20 years) undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis in 2 tertiary care referral centers from January 2007 through December 2012. Twenty-two different operative technique/dressing variations were documented. The 6 technique/dressing groups with >50 patients were assessed, including a total of 1283 patients. RESULTS The surgical site infection rate of the 220 patients treated with TULAA and application of an umbilical vacuum dressing with dry gauze is 1.8% (95% CI, 0.0-10.3%). This compares to an infection rate of 4.1% (95% CI, 1.3-10.5%) in 97 patients with dry dressing without vacuum. In the 395 patients who received an umbilical vacuum dressing with gauze and bacitracin, the surgical site infection rate was found to be 4.3% (95% CI, 2.7-6.8%). CONCLUSIONS Application of an umbilical negative-pressure dressing with dry gauze lowers the rate of umbilical site infections in patients undergoing transumbilical laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy for acute appendicitis.","Seifarth, Federico G; Kundu, Neilendu; Guerron, Alfredo D; Garland, Mary M; Gaffley, Michaela W G; Worley, Sarah; Knight, Colin G",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,121,1

Viroids and other circular single-stranded RNAs can be synthesised in vitro by a PCR-based procedure using a simple set of reactions. Two end-to-end primers are selected from a desired region of the viroid, one for the synthesis of the first strand cDNA and another for the production of the second strand DNA. The second primer contains an 18 nucleotide T7 promoter at its 5' end, and is selected such that the G nucleotide at the transcription start site represents a G in the viroid. Linked reverse transcription-PCR results in linear double-stranded DNA consisting of the viroid sequence and the T7 promoter. Run-off transcription of the PCR product allows the synthesis of exact-length linear viroid RNA which can be circularised by T4 RNA ligase following an enzymic modification of the 5' triphosphate to a monophosphate. This procedure results in authentic viroid molecules and obviates the need for construction and cloning of DNA in the form of tandem repeats for infectivity tests. It also allows PCR-based manipulation of circular RNAs, thus greatly simplifying structure-function analyses of viroid molecules.","Rezaian, M A",Current issues in molecular biology,121,4

The mechanisms responsible for viral-induced exacerbations remain uncertain. Proposed mechanisms include direct infection of the lower respiratory tract, the inflammatory response to viruses, increases in bronchial responsiveness and up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in bronchial epithelium. In addition, exposure to allergens, especially seasonal allergens, in sensitized asthmatic individuals have been implicated in asthma attacks. Increased levels of exposure in sensitized asthmatics have been related to increases in hospital admissions and emergency room visits, increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, increased levels of exhaled nitric oxide, lower levels of lung function, increased treatment requirements, and even increased mortality. In recent years studies have suggested that viruses and allergens may have a synergistic effect on individuals with asthma, thus having a greater influence on exacerbation rate together than either factor alone. Models of experimentally induced RV infection in both allergic and nonallergic individuals using bronchoalveolar lavage and segmental allergen challenge have helped researchers to investigate the possibility of an interaction between allergen sensitization, exposure, and virus infection and their role in the induction of an asthma exacerbation. This review aims to summarize the evidence supporting the role of viruses (in particular RV) as well as the role of, and interaction with, allergen sensitization and exposure on exacerbations of asthma.","Murray, Clare S; Simpson, Angela; Custovic, Adnan",Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society,121,9

The number of emergency surgery procedures performed in Spanish hospitals decreased significantly during the first wave of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing the emergency surgery activity in a Spanish tertiary Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency surgery activity registered in 2019 during the equivalent time period. RESULTS 1802 patients were included in control group (CG) versus 756 in pandemic group (PG). Mean number of patients who underwent emergency surgery during the control and pandemic periods was 3.42 patients per day, in contrast to 1.62 during the pandemic period, which represents a 52.6% decrease in emergency surgery activity. During the pandemic period, most of the patients consulted after more than 72 hours of symptoms, representing a delay in presenting in the ER of 23.7% when compared to CG. Surgeries due to complications from previous elective procedures decreased (12% vs. 6.1%) in PG, probably because elective procedures are being postponed. We had a 13.1% COVID-19 positivity rate. Morbidity was higher during pandemic (52.5% vs. 35.2%). Mortality rates in patients undergoing emergency surgery was higher in PG (12.1% vs. 4.8%). CONCLUSIONS The impact of the first wave of COVID-19 in emergency surgery activity has been profound.

The authors estimated the incidence and risk of TCHM-related perioperative events. METHODS In a Hong Kong cohort study, 601 patients undergoing major elective surgery were asked about their Western medicine and TCHM use in the 2 weeks before surgery. Unanticipated perioperative events were noted by attending anesthesiologists, blinded to patients' use of specific TCHMs. Modified Poisson regression models were used to obtain the relative risk of combined endpoints of perioperative events associated with TCHM use. RESULTS Of the 601 patients, 483 patients (80%) took self-prescribed TCHM, and 47 (8%) took TCHM by prescription (with or without self-prescribed TCHM) in the 2 weeks before surgery. The crude incidences of any combined endpoints of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative events were 23% (95% confidence interval, 19-26%), 74% (95% confidence interval, 71-78%), and 63% (95% confidence interval, 59-66%), respectively. Compared with nonusers, patients who took TCHM by prescription were more likely to have a preoperative event (adjusted relative risk, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.29). The authors present four case reports to highlight the effect of TCHM by prescription on prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and hypokalemia in the preoperative period. In contrast, there was no significant association between the use of any type of TCHM and the occurrence of either intraoperative or postoperative events. CONCLUSIONS The use of TCHM by prescription near the time of surgery should be discouraged because of the increased risk of adverse events in the preoperative period.","Lee, Anna; Chui, Po Tong; Aun, Cindy S T; Lau, Angel S C; Gin, Tony",Anesthesiology,121,33

PES is an infectious intestinal disease of young turkeys between 1 day and 7 wk of age and is characterized by diarrhea, depression, and lethargy with pale intestines and/or excessively fluid cecal contents. During the study period, samples from 1736 turkey flocks were submitted to the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for disease investigation. Of these, 151 flocks (8.7%) were PES positive. Cases of PES were seen throughout the year with higher prevalence in fall. The PES was statistically associated with age with higher occurrence in poults less than 3 wk of age. Rotavirus, small round virus (SRV), Salmonella, nonhemolytic Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Eimeria oocysts were detected alone or in different combinations. Reovirus and adenovirus were found in one flock each. The most commonly identified pathogens were Salmonella (85 flocks) and rotavirus (73 flocks). Of PES-affected flocks, 39 (25.8%), 66 (43.7%), and 37 (24.5%) had one, two, and three or more pathogens, respectively. Rotavirus, SRV, and reovirus occurred mostly in poults of less than 6 wk of age while Salmonella, E. coli, and Eimeria were seen in poults of all age groups. Minimum age for rotavirus detection was in 2-day-old poults. Histopathologically, moderate to severe mixed intestinal villus or lamina propria inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis of distal villus tips in intestinal specimens, and mild to severe lymphocellular depletion in thymus, bursa, and spleen were seen. Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from PES-affected flocks revealed maximum sensitivity to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ceftiofur and a varying degree of resistance to other antimicrobials.","Jindal, Naresh; Patnayak, Devi P; Ziegler, Andre F; Lago, Alfonso; Goyal, Sagar M",Avian diseases,121,31

From that moment it has quickly spread around the whole world. It causes COVID-19 disease manifested by breathlessness, coughing and high temperature. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a great challenge for humanity. The aim: To analyze interventions of emergency medical teams during the SAR-CoV-2 pandemic, and to compare obtained data with the same periods in 2018-2019. PATIENTS AND METHODS Material and methods: The study retrospectively analyzed interventions of emergency medical teams in the period from 15.03 to 15.05 in 2018 - 2020. 1,479,530 interventions of emergency medical teams were included in the study. The number of interventions, reasons for calls, and diagnoses made by heads of the emergency medical teams during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were compared to the same period in 2018-2019. RESULTS Results: Authors observed the decline in the number of interventions performed by emergency medical teams during the pandemic in relation to earlier years by approximately 25%. The big decline concerned interventions that were the reason for calls to public places, such as ""traffic accident"" and ""collapse"". In the case of diagnoses made by the head of the emergency medical team, the diagnoses regarding stroke or sudden cardiac arrest remained at the similar level. Others showed a marked decline. CONCLUSION Conclusions: Reduced social activity contributed to a reduced number of interventions by emergency medical teams in public places. The societal fear of the unknown also contributed to the decrease in the number of interventions performed by emergency medical teams. People began to avoid contact with other people.","Kucap, Michał; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Ładny, Jerzy R; Zyśko, Dorota; Gałązkowski, Robert; Gąsior, Mariusz; Kraska, Waldemar",Wiadomosci lekarskie,121,28

Wesley College STEM student COVID-19 impact surveys showed underlying gaps in economic equity, increased family responsibilities, struggles to stay motivated, social isolation, and higher levels of psychological stress. Yet, the crisis demonstrated new ways in which technology can be harnessed and allowed STEM students to reconsider how jobs and skills should be aligned. A STEM faculty COVID-19 check-in survey and interview responses revealed a quick realization that faculty could not rely solely on Wesley's Jenzebar learning management system (MyWesley). To engage their students and to create a supportive learning environment, STEM faculty sought new strategies and approaches for a diverse set of STEM learners. For synchronous e-teaching, the faculty used the Microsoft-Teams and the Zoom video conferencing platforms. Faculty only adopted MyWesley to execute dedicated asynchronous tasks (laboratory assignments, reports, exams). The STEM students were overwhelmingly positive about STEM faculty availability during the crisis. Still, both faculty and students indicated a much stronger preference for the face-to-face delivery of their course content via a traditional classroom setting.","D'Souza, Malcolm J; Fry, Katelynn; Koyanagi, Lyndsey; Shepherd, Andrew",Journal of education and e-learning research,121,26

A breast cancer mimic, IGM also is diagnosed by breast biopsy. On December 12, 2008, a physician in Indianapolis, Indiana, reported a cluster of seven IGM diagnoses in multigravid Hispanic women, an unusually high number. To evaluate the etiology of the breast masses and characterize associated epidemiologic and clinical features, the Indiana State Department of Health and CDC conducted a multidisciplinary investigation. This report describes the results of that investigation. A total of nine cases of IGM were confirmed during 2006-2008 in Indianapolis, for an annual prevalence of IGM of 2.4 per 100,000 women aged 20-40 years. The prevalence was 12 times higher among Hispanic women. Among IGM patients at the hospital, a median of 5 months elapsed between symptom onset and diagnostic biopsy. Histopathologic evaluations confirmed IGM. In a case-control study of all seven cases and 21 controls from the hospital, case-patients were significantly more likely than controls to have less than a sixth-grade education (odds ratio [OR] = 12.7), a positive tuberculin skin test (OR = undefined), or a medication allergy (OR = 15.0). No other risk factors were significantly associated with case status. Barriers to accessing health care, including low education level, resulted in delayed care for breast masses.

METHODS Between 1 January 2020 and 31 July 2020, we retrospectively reviewed paediatric emergency department attendances and admissions in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Singapore before and after a national lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. Hospital attendances and admissions were compared with data from a corresponding period in 2019 (1 January 2019 to 31 July 2019), as well as during and after the SARS outbreak (1 January 2003 to 31 December 2004). RESULTS Compared with a corresponding non-outbreak period, emergency department attendances decreased in line with nationwide public health measures during the COVID-19 and SARS outbreaks (2020 and 2003 respectively), before increasing gradually following lifting of restrictions, albeit not to recorded levels before these outbreaks. During the COVID-19 outbreak, mean daily attendances decreased by 40%, from 458 per day in January-July 2019, to 274 per day in January-July 2020. The absolute number of hospital inpatient admissions decreased by 37% from January-July 2019 (19,629) to January-July 2020 (12,304). The proportion of emergency department attendances requiring admission remained similar: 20% in January-July 2019 and 21% in January-July 2020. CONCLUSION Nationwide public health measures in Singapore have had an impact on paediatric emergency department attendances and hospital inpatient admissions. Data from this study could inform planning and resource allocation for emergency departments in Singapore and internationally.","Tan, Ronald M R; Ganapathy, Sashikumar; Tyebally, Arif; Lee, Khai Pin; Chong, Shu Ling; Soo, Jenifer S L; Thoon, Koh Cheng; Chan, Yoke Hwee; Ng, Kee Chong","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",121,19

Here, we discuss our recent findings regarding (R-Ahx-R)(4)AhxB (Ahx is 6-aminohexanoic acid and B is beta-alanine) CPP-PMO conjugates in DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and murine coronavirus research. An (R-Ahx-R)(4)AhxB-PMO conjugate was the most effective compound in inducing the correction of mutant dystrophin transcripts in myoblasts derived from a canine model of DMD. Similarly, normal levels of dystrophin expression were restored in the diaphragms of mdx mice, with treatment starting at the neonatal stage, and protein was still detecTable 22 weeks after the last dose of an (R-Ahx-R)(4)AhxB-PMO conjugate. Effects of length, linkage and carbohydrate modification of this CPP on the delivery of a PMO were investigated in a coronavirus mouse model. An (R-Ahx-R)(4)AhxB-PMO conjugate effectively inhibited viral replication, in comparison with other peptides conjugated to the same PMO. Shortening the CPP length, modifying it with a mannosylated serine moiety or replacing it with the R(9)F(2) CPP significantly decreased the efficacy of the resulting PPMO (CPP-PMO conjugate). We attribute the success of this CPP to its stability in serum and its capacity to transport PMO to RNA targets in a manner superior to that of poly-arginine CPPs.","Moulton, H M; Fletcher, S; Neuman, B W; McClorey, G; Stein, D A; Abes, S; Wilton, S D; Buchmeier, M J; Lebleu, B; Iversen, P L",Biochemical Society transactions,121,26

Tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) family members are some of these restriction factors. It is becoming increasingly clear that gene expression differences, rather than protein-coding regions changes, could play a vital role in the anti-retroviral immune mechanism. Increasingly, recent studies have created genome-scale catalogues of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), which demark potentially functional regulatory DNA. To improve our understanding of the molecular evolution mechanism of antiviral differences between species, we leveraged 14 130 DHSs derived from 145 cell types to characterize the regulatory landscape of the TRIM region. Subsequently, we compared the alignments of the DHSs across six primates and found 375 DHSs that are conserved in non-human primates but exhibit significantly accelerated rates of evolution in the human lineage (haDHSs). Furthermore, we discovered 31 human-specific potential transcription factor motifs within haDHSs, including the KROX and SP1, that both interact with HIV-1 Importantly, the corresponding haDHS was correlated with antiviral factor TRIM23 Thus, our results suggested that some viruses may contribute, through regulatory DNA differences, to organismal evolution by mediating TRIM gene expression to escape immune surveillance.","He, Dan-Dan; Lu, Yueer; Gittelman, Rachel; Jin, Yabin; Ling, Fei; Joshua, Akey",Proceedings.

Here, we summarize the status of current efforts to identify the specific genes underlying otitis media susceptibility and presentation. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have focused on identifying candidate genes. For example, IFN-gamma polymorphisms, allotypes of the leukocyte IgG (FcgammaR) receptors and certain haplotypes of surfactant genes were linked in pilot studies to otitis media susceptibility. The pattern of gene expression during an episode of otitis media is also being elucidated with the overall goal of providing clues as to which of these modulated genes are polymorphic and thus potentially capable of affecting otitis media susceptibility. Mucin and cathepsin protease genes were shown to exhibit these characteristics. SUMMARY In addition to the simple searches for linkages between known genes and otitis media, work is progressing within the context of genome-wide linkage studies. These efforts promise to answer some of the many questions remaining in otitis media susceptibility and pathogenesis.","Casselbrant, Margaretha L; Mandel, Ellen M",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,121,17

The incidence of lung cancer increases with age, and Medicare beneficiaries are often at increased risk. Because of its demonstrated effectiveness in reducing mortality, lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging will be covered without cost-sharing starting January 1, 2015, by nongrandfathered commercial plans. Medicare is considering coverage for lung cancer screening. OBJECTIVE To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness (ie, cost per life-year saved) of LDCT lung cancer screening of the Medicare population at high risk for lung cancer. METHODS Medicare costs, enrollment, and demographics were used for this study; they were derived from the 2012 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) beneficiary files and were forecast to 2014 based on CMS and US Census Bureau projections. Standard life and health actuarial techniques were used to calculate the cost and cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening. The cost, incidence rates, mortality rates, and other parameters chosen by the authors were taken from actual Medicare data, and the modeled screenings are consistent with Medicare processes and procedures. RESULTS Approximately 4.9 million high-risk Medicare beneficiaries would meet criteria for lung cancer screening in 2014. Without screening, Medicare patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer have an average life expectancy of approximately 3 years. Based on our analysis, the average annual cost of LDCT lung cancer screening in Medicare is estimated to be $241 per person screened. LDCT screening for lung cancer in Medicare beneficiaries aged 55 to 80 years with a history of ≥30 pack-years of smoking and who had smoked within 15 years is low cost, at approximately $1 per member per month. This assumes that 50% of these patients were screened. Such screening is also highly cost-effective, at <$19,000 per life-year saved. CONCLUSION If all eligible Medicare beneficiaries had been screened and treated consistently from age 55 years, approximately 358,134 additional individuals with current or past lung cancer would be alive in 2014. LDCT screening is a low-cost and cost-effective strategy that fits well within the standard Medicare benefit, including its claims payment and quality monitoring.","Pyenson, Bruce S; Henschke, Claudia I; Yankelevitz, David F; Yip, Rowena; Dec, Ellynne",American health & drug benefits,121,9

METHODS Electronic and manual searches was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for comparing the effects of integrative traditional Chinese and Western medicine versus the effects of Western medicine alone in treating SARS. Methodological quality of trials was assessed in terms of generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and intention-to-treat. Exploring analysis was carried out on the non-randomized clinical controlled studies. Two authors collected data independently and evaluated quality and results. The data were quantified by Meta-analysis. RESULTS Eight RCTs (488 SARS patients) were included. The methodological quality was generally low. Results of Meta-analysis showed that the integrative therapy could significantly reduce the mortality (relative risk 0.32 [95% CI 0.12 - 0.91]) and the occurrence of fungal infection in patients who received hormone (glucocorticoid) therapy (0.35: 0.14 - 0.90), shorten the duration of fever (weighted mean difference -0.83 day; -1.30 - -0.35) and symptom relieving time (-1.23; -2.09 - -0.37), reduce the persistent time of chest radiograph abnormalities (- 2.61; -3.74 - -1.49). But it showed no significant difference on quality of life or glucocorticoid dosage. Conclusion The integrative therapy may have beneficial effects in lowering mortality, reducing complications, shortening the duration of symptoms and fever existence and lessening pulmonary inflammation in SARS patients. The evidence is insufficient to come to the affirmative conclusion due to the low methodological quality of the included trials.","Liu, Jian-ping; Manheimer, Eric; Shi, Yi",Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,121,12

The main host for the ISA virus is probably a fish occurring in the coastal area, most likely a salmonid fish. Since sea trout is an abundant species along the Norwegian coast, common in areas where ISA outbreaks occur, and possibly a life-long carrier of the ISA virus, a study was initiated to evaluate reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of the virus in experimentally infected trout. Several tissues (kidney, spleen, heart and skin) were collected from the trout during a 135 d period. The following diagnostic methods for detection of the ISA virus were compared: cell culture (Atlantic Salmon Kidney, ASK cells), challenge of disease-free salmon with blood from the infected trout, and RT-PCR. The RT-PCR was the most sensitive of these methods. With the help of this technique it was possible to pick out positive individuals throughout the experimental period of 135 d. Challenge of disease-free salmon were more sensitive than cell culture (ASK cells). These 2 latter methods require use of the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) or RT-PCR for verification of presence of ISA virus.","Devold, M; Krossøy, B; Aspehaug, V; Nylund, A",Diseases of aquatic organisms,121,1

The anaemia induced by PRRSV was probably due to a direct or indirect effect on erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow.","Halbur, R G; Pallarés, F J; Rathje, J A; Evans, R; Hagemoser, W A; Paul, P S; Meng, X J",The Veterinary record,121,1

Theory of planned behavior was the framework to explain the intentions of Korean nurses for SARS patients care. METHODS A convenient sample of six hundreds and seventy nine clinical nurses from four university-affiliated hospitals located in Seoul and in Kyung-gi province was used. Self-administered (83-items) questionnaire was used to collect data. Intentions, attitude, subjective norm, perceive behavioral control, behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs, and control beliefs were the study variables. All items were measured using 7-point Likert scale (-3 to +3). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation method, and stepwise multiple regression methods. RESULTS Intentions and attitudes toward SARS patient care among Korean clinical nurses were moderate, but their subjective norm and perceive behavioral control of SARS patients care were negative. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that attitude toward SARS patient care, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm were the determinants of the intentions for SARS patients care as theory proposed. Among the behavioral beliefs, ""SARS-patient caring would be a new experience"", ""during SARS-patient caring, I should be apart from my family"", ""after completing SARS-patient caring, I would be proud of myself being able to cope with a stressful event"" and ""with my SARS-patient caring, patients could recover from SARS"" were the significant determinants. Among the normative beliefs, colleague approval, spouse approval, and physician approval were significant determinants of the intentions. Among the control beliefs, ""SARS-patient caring would be a challenge"" ""SARS-patient caring is a professional responsibility"", ""tension during the care of SARS patients"" and ""support from team members"" were the significant determinants of the intentions. CONCLUSIONS Korean clinical nurses in this study were not willing to care for SARS patients and showed negative attitude toward the care. They believed their friends and family were not approved their care for SARS patients. Nurses were in conflicts between professional responsibilities to care for SARS patients and personal safety. This study was the first to understand stress and burden of Korean clinical nurses who are in front line to care for newly developed communicable disease such as SARS. Under the circumstance where several fatal communicable diseases are predictable, conflicts between professional responsibility and their personal risks should be taken into considerations by nurses themselves and by nursing administrators in order to improve quality of care.","Kim, Cho-Ja; Yoo, Hye-Ra; Yoo, Myung Sook; Kwon, Bo Eun; Hwang, Kyung Ja",Taehan Kanho Hakhoe chi,121,1

Deployment of an aortic cuff did not achieve a better seal at the proximal neck, and the aneurysm developed a rupture. We successfully treated the ruptured aneurysm using transcatheter Onyx embolization only. At 6-month and 1-year follow-ups with contrast-enhanced duplex scanning, no endoleak was seen and sac shrinkage was observed. Onyx is a relatively new liquid embolic agent that is slowly transformed into a solid state by contact with blood. Owing to this unique characteristic, Onyx embolization can be a useful technique for stopping bleeding from an aneurysm in an emergency situation. This is a unique case of the use of an embolization agent in the treatment of aortic aneurysm rupture.","Fujita, Satoko; Hörer, Tal; Pirouzram, Artai; Toivola, Asko; Gruber, Göran; Larzon, Thomas",Innovations,121,1

As expected, cases of dysphagia following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported to date have all been intubated. We here report a case of sarcopenic dysphagia following severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a nonintubated older adult. The patient was an 85-year-old male who was readmitted to the hospital with dysphagia and subsequent aspiration pneumonia in the first week after his discharge from the COVID-19 unit. On physical examination, the patient was sarcopenic and malnourished. Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) revealed aspiration into the airway. Enteral feeding was initiated and the infusion rate gradually increased to achieve the desired protein-energy targets. Control FEES 2 months after discharge showed recovery of swallowing function, with no apparent penetration or aspiration. Clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 should be aware that dysphagia, which is associated with increased mortality in older adults, may occur even in the absence of intubation. We recommend that the evaluation of dysphagia be part of the clinical assessment in older COVID-19 patients with malnutrition or sarcopenia.","Can, Büsra; Ismagulova, Narkiza; Enver, Necati; Tufan, Asli; Cinel, Ismail",Nutr Clin Pract,121,27

This study develops a general framework for fast and flexible non-Gaussian regression, especially for spatial/spatiotemporal modeling. The developed model, termed the compositionally-warped additive mixed model (CAMM), combines an additive mixed model (AMM) and the compositionally-warped Gaussian process to model a wide variety of non-Gaussian continuous data including spatial and other effects. A specific advantage of the proposed CAMM is that it requires no explicit assumption of data distribution unlike existing AMMs. Monte Carlo experiments show the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of CAMM for modeling non-Gaussian data including fat-tailed and/or skewed distributions. Finally, the model is applied to crime data to examine the empirical performance of the regression analysis and prediction. The result shows that CAMM provides intuitively reasonable coefficient estimates and outperforms AMM in terms of prediction accuracy. CAMM is verified to be a fast and flexible model that potentially covers a wide variety of non-Gaussian data modeling. The proposed approach is implemented in an R package spmoran.","Murakami, Daisuke; Kajita, Mami; Kajita, Seiji; Matsui, Tomoko",,121,28

Here, using a large sample of 1,749 Australians and Americans, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 isolation on younger populations (13-25 years), and the influence of coping strategies and mental well-being on this impact. Overall, COVID-19 isolation had a more negative impact on adolescence (13-17 years) than young adulthood (18-25 years), but with no difference apparent between men and women, or between Australian and American residents. However, a deeper analysis revealed a gender-specific effect: the type of coping strategies differentially influenced the negative impact of COVID-19 isolation on men with various levels of well-being, an interaction effect not apparent in women. For men with lower levels of mental well-being, COVID-19 isolation appeared to have a less negative impact on them if they used more approach-oriented coping strategies (e.g., actively focusing on the problem). Our results provide cross-sectional evidence for a differential impact on young men at low levels of wellbeing by pandemic isolation. In sum, young men and adolescent boys with lower well-being coped better with COVID-19 isolation when they used more approach coping strategies.","Cheng, P. X.; Park, H. R. P.; Gatt, J.

However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic. Findings can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.","Gémes, Katalin; Talbäck, Mats; Modig, Karin; Ahlbom, Anders; Berglund, Anita; Feychting, Maria; Matthews, Anthony A",Eur J Epidemiol,121,16

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%).

Among 126,137 unique patients with an index COVID-19 admission during March-July 2020, 15% died during the index hospitalization. Among the 106,543 (85%) surviving patients, 9% (9,504) were readmitted to the same hospital within 2 months of discharge through August 2020. More than a single readmission occurred among 1.6% of patients discharged after the index hospitalization. Readmissions occurred more often among patients discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) (15%) or those needing home health care (12%) than among patients discharged to home or self-care (7%).

Understanding the frequency of, and risk factors for, readmission can inform clinical practice, discharge disposition decisions, and public health priorities such as health care planning to ensure availability of resources needed for acute and follow-up care of COVID-19 patients. With the recent increases in cases nationwide, hospital planning can account for these increasing numbers along with the potential for at least 9% of patients to be readmitted, requiring additional beds and resources.","Lavery, Amy M; Preston, Leigh Ellyn; Ko, Jean Y; Chevinsky, Jennifer R; DeSisto, Carla L; Pennington, Audrey F; Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Datta, S Deblina; Click, Eleanor S; Golden, Thomas; Goodman, Alyson B; Mac Kenzie, William R; Boehmer, Tegan K; Gundlapalli, Adi V",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,121,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of respondents to the 2011 Census of England and Wales in private households, linked to death registrations and adjusted for emigration (n = 47 872 412). The outcome of interest was death involving COVID-19 between 2 March 2020 and 15 May 2020. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for ethnic-minority groups compared with the White population, controlling for individual, household and area characteristics. HRs were estimated on the full outcome period and separately for pre- and post-lockdown periods. RESULTS: In age-adjusted models, people from all ethnic-minority groups were at elevated risk of COVID-19 mortality; the HRs for Black males and females were 3.13 (95% confidence interval: 2.93 to 3.34) and 2.40 (2.20 to 2.61), respectively. However, in fully adjusted models for females, the HRs were close to unity for all ethnic groups except Black [1.29 (1.18 to 1.42)].

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor for host cell entry. We aimed to assess the interactions between antihyperglycemic drugs and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and their putative roles in COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was performed using Pubmed to review the interrelationships between hyperglycemia, RAS and COVID-19, and the effects of antihyperglycemic medications. RESULTS: The RAS has an essential role in glucose homeostasis and may have a role in COVID-19-induced lung injury. Some antihyperglycemic medications modulate RAS and might hypothetically alleviate the deleterious effect of angiotensin II on lung injury.

Using traditionally existing 2D models, the therapeutic efficacy of drugs has been inappropriately validated due to the failure in generating the precise therapeutic response. Fortunately, a 3D model addresses the foregoing limitations by recapitulating the in vivo environment. In this context, one has to contemplate the design of an appropriate scaffold for favoring the organization of cell microenvironment. Instituting pertinent model on the platter will pave way for a precise mimicking of in vivo conditions. It is because animal cells in scaffolds oblige spontaneous formation of 3D colonies that molecularly, phenotypically, and histologically resemble the native environment. The 3D culture provides insight into the biochemical aspects of cell-cell communication, plasticity, cell division, cytoskeletal reorganization, signaling mechanisms, differentiation, and cell death. Focusing on these criteria, this paper discusses in detail, the diversification of polymeric scaffolds based on their available resources. The paper also reviews the well-founded and latest techniques of scaffold fabrication, and their applications pertaining to tissue engineering, drug screening, and tumor model development.","Badekila, Anjana K; Kini, Sudarshan; Jaiswal, Amit K",J. cell. physiol,121,20

In Latin America, civil society organizations have developed a repertoire of collective action, seeking to provide immediate and medium-term responses to the emergency. This paper aims to map these initiatives and identify strategic approaches to tackle the issues, given the strengths of those undertaking the initiative, and the scope, purpose and sphere of intervention. Using direct contact, a survey, and a virtual ethnography with social organizations has allowed us to identify and characterize the initiatives. The repertoire focuses on emergency measures around food security, and pedagogies for prevention, sanitation and income relief at the neighbourhood and district levels. We argue that the civil society response repertoire is diverse in form and resources but limited in scope; meanwhile the urgency of the situation and the mismatch with state action mean that crucial spheres of informality, vital to cultivating grounds for a healthy recovery phase, are being neglected.","Duque Franco, Isabel; Ortiz, Catalina; Samper, Jota; Millan, Gynna",Environ.

Moreover, there is a need for a multidimensional county-level approach to monitor the second wave of covid-19 in the USA. METHOD: We use an artificial intelligence framework based on timeline of policy interventions that triangulated results based on the three approaches-Bayesian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), Kalman filter, and machine learning. RESULTS: Our findings suggest three important insights. First, the effective growth rate of covid-19 infections dropped in response to the approximate dates of key policy interventions. We find that the change points for spreading rates approximately coincide with the timelines of policy interventions across respective countries. Second, forecasted trend until mid-June in the USA was downward trending, stable, and linear. Sweden is likely to be heading in the other direction. That is, Sweden's forecasted trend until mid-June appears to be non-linear and upward trending. Canada appears to fall somewhere in the middle-the trend for the same period is flat. Third, a Kalman filter based robustness check indicates that by mid-June the USA will likely have close to two million virus cases, while Sweden will likely have over 44,000 covid-19 cases. CONCLUSION: We show that drop in effective growth rate of covid-19 infections was sharper in the case of stringent policies (USA and Canada) but was more gradual in the case of relaxed policy (Sweden). Our study exhorts policy makers to take these results into account as they consider the implications of relaxing lockdown measures.","Vaid, Shashank; McAdie, Aaron; Kremer, Ran; Khanduja, Vikas; Bhandari, Mohit",Int Orthop,121,20

As a result, the government authorized the hiring of senior students. OBJECTIVES: To explore the perspectives of a group of final-year nursing students who were hired on the basis of a relief contract for health professionals during the first COVID-19 outbreak, regarding their learning process and their mixed role as students and novice nurses. DESIGN: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted. SETTINGS: The Nursing Department of the European University of Madrid, and the Red Cross College of Nursing. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen nursing students were recruited, aged between 18 and 65 years old, enrolled in the fourth year of Nursing Studies and who were hired under a relief contract for health professionals during the pandemic. METHODS: Purposive sampling was used. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were carried out using a question guide. Interviews were conducted in a private video chat room platform. Also, a thematic, inductive analysis was performed. This study was conducted according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. RESULTS: Four specific themes emerged: a) The students' role during the relief contract; b) The learning process during the pandemic; c) Barriers to learning; and d) A unique learning opportunity. The students had an undefined mixed role, which hindered their skills and activities. Learning was self-directed, sometimes through trial and error, and through experiencing critical events. Time constraints and having to learn under pressure were experienced as difficulties for learning. Nevertheless, this was a unique professional learning opportunity. The students learned to be organized and effective, acknowledge their limitations, gain confidence, face their fears, and mature. CONCLUSIONS: These results can help inform nurse training programs and improve the organization and incorporation of nurses in health care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Velarde-García, Juan Francisco; Cachón-Pérez, Jose Miguel; Rodríguez-García, Marta; Oliva-Fernández, Oscar; González-Sanz, Pilar; Espejo, Marta Mas; González-Hervías, Raquel; Álvarez-Embarba, Beatriz; Moro-López-Menchero, Paloma; Fernández-de-Las-Peñas, César; Palacios-Ceña, Domingo",Nurse Educ Today,121,4

The treatment of choice for CDI is antibiotics (vancomycin or fidaxomicin), with a possibility of recurrent CDI despite lack of additional risk factors for CDI. For the last 10 years, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a promising therapy for recurrent CDI, with success rates of over 85% compared with less than 50% with antibiotics for multiple recurrent CDI. Along with the success of FMT, several adverse and serious adverse events with FMT have been reported. These range from self-limiting abdominal pain to death due to severe sepsis. This review focuses on the safety of FMT, emphasizing the reports of transmission of pathobionts like extended-spectrum beta lactamase Escherichia coli and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is a potential pathogen that could be transmitted via FMT during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recently, epigenetic alterations have been included in the classification of the CRC molecular subtype, and this points out their prognostic impact. As epigenetic modifications are reversible, they may represent relevant therapeutic targets. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), regulates gene expression. For many years, the deregulation of DNA methylation has been considered to play a substantial part in CRC etiology and evolution. Despite considerable advances in CRC treatment, patient therapy response persists as limited, and their profit from systemic therapies are often hampered by the introduction of chemoresistance. In addition, inter-individual changes in therapy response in CRC patients can arise from their specific (epi)genetic compositions. In this review article, we summarize the options of CRC treatment based on DNA methylation status for their predictive value. This review also includes the therapy outcomes based on the patient's methylation status in CRC patients. In addition, the current challenge of research is to develop therapeutic inhibitors of DNMT. Based on the essential role of DNA methylation in CRC development, the application of DNMT inhibitors was recently proposed for the treatment of CRC patients, especially in patients with DNA hypermethylation.","Cervena, Klara; Siskova, Anna; Buchler, Tomas; Vodicka, Pavel; Vymetalkova, Veronika",,121,28

Policy responses have disrupted usual patterns of movement in society, locally and globally, with resultant impacts on national economies and human well-being. These interventions have primarily centred on enforcing lockdowns and introducing social distancing recommendations, leading to questions of trust and competency around the role of institutions and the administrative apparatus of state. This study demonstrates the unequal societal impacts in population movement during a national 'lockdown'. METHODS: We use nationwide mobile phone movement data to quantify the effect of an enforced lockdown on population mobility by neighbourhood deprivation using an ecological study design. We then derive a mobility index using anonymised aggregated population counts for each neighbourhood (2253 Census Statistical Areas; mean population n=2086) of national hourly mobile phone location data (7.45 million records, 1 March 2020-20 July 2020) for New Zealand (NZ). RESULTS: Curtailing movement has highlighted and exacerbated underlying social and spatial inequalities. Our analysis reveals the unequal movements during 'lockdown' by neighbourhood socioeconomic status in NZ. CONCLUSION: In understanding inequalities in neighbourhood movements, we are contributing critical new evidence to the policy debate about the impact(s) and efficacy of national, regional or local lockdowns which have sparked such controversy.","Campbell, Malcolm; Marek, Lukas; Wiki, Jesse; Hobbs, Matthew; Sabel, Clive E; McCarthy, John; Kingham, Simon",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),121,1

Single-cell profiling methods enable the investigation of cell population distributions and transcriptional changes along the airways. Methods: We have explored the cellular heterogeneity of the human airway epithelium in 10 healthy living volunteers by single-cell RNA profiling. 77,969 cells were collected at 35 distinct locations, from the nose to the 12th division of the airway tree. Results: The resulting atlas is composed of a high percentage of epithelial cells (89.1%), but also immune (6.2%) and stromal (4.7%) cells with distinct cellular proportions in different regions of the airways. It reveals differential gene expression between identical cell types (suprabasal, secretory, and multiciliated cells) from the nose (MUC4, PI3, SIX3) and tracheobronchial (SCGB1A1, TFF3) airways. By contrast, cell-type specific gene expression is stable across all tracheobronchial samples. Our atlas improves the description of ionocytes, pulmonary neuro-endocrine (PNEC) and brush cells, and identifies a related population of NREP-positive cells. We also report the association of KRT13 with dividing cells that are reminiscent of previously described mouse ""hillock"" cells, and with squamous cells expressing SCEL, SPRR1A/B. Conclusions: Robust characterization of a single-cell cohort in healthy airways establishes a valuable resource for future investigations. The precise description of the continuum existing from the nasal epithelium to successive divisions of the airways and the stable gene expression profile of these regions better defines conditions under which relevant tracheobronchial proxies of human respiratory diseases can be developed.","Deprez, Marie; Zaragosi, Laure-Emmanuelle; Truchi, Marin; Becavin, Christophe; Ruiz García, Sandra; Arguel, Marie-Jeanne; Plaisant, Magali; Magnone, Virginie; Lebrigand, Kevin; Abelanet, Sophie; Brau, Frédéric; Paquet, Agnès; Pe039,; er, Dana; Marquette, Charles-Hugo; Leroy, Sylvie; Barbry, Pascal",Am. j. respir. crit. care med,121,1

Objective: To find out the risk factors zone associated with Coronavirus disease among children under five age using malnourished status, pre-existing morbidity conditions, household environmental factors, and also with case fatality and active case rate of COVID-19 disease in India.Data sources & Methods: Data was utilized from the 4th round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2015-16, and CFR and ACR of COVID-19 related data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on 18th May 2020. Mean, standard deviation, and Z-score statistical methods have been employed to identify the risk factors zone and hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi) has been used. Results: The states and UTs which have a high composite vulnerability score of the COVID-19 among under-5 children are Meghalaya (CVS=1), Uttar Pradesh (CVS=0.93), Jharkhand (CVS=0.86), Bihar, (CVS=0.74), Madhya Pradesh (CVS=0.74), and Odisha (CVS=0.55). The states and UTs which have low composite vulnerability score of the COVID-19 among under-5 children are Sikkim (CVS= -0.90), Daman & Diu (CVS= -0.76) Lakshadweep (CVS= -0.74), Kerala (CVS= -0.72), Chandigarh (CVS= -0.71). The COVID-19 vulnerable/ risk factors zone (hot spot: 99% Confidence interval [CI]) were observed in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Meghalaya states of India, which are spatially high clustered. The low rates of (cold spot: 95% CI) less vulnerable zones were observed in Kerala, Mizoram which is spatially low clustered. Conclusions: Well-built public health measures, including rapidly searching in high focus areas and testing of COVID-19, should be performed in vulnerable areas of COVID-19.","Saha, Jay; Chouhan, Pradip",Child Youth Serv Rev,121,21

This chromatography resin yielded very large distribution coefficients for Pu4+ (>105) in 0.5 - 6 M HNO3 feed solutions. Various physicochemical properties such as sorption kinetics, Pu4+ sorption mechanism, and its sorption capacity were investigated. The sorption kinetics, following a pseudo-second-order model, showed that about 10 minutes of equilibration was sufficient for >99.9% sorption of Pu4+. The sorption of Pu4+ on the resin followed the Langmuir monolayer model, which was confirmed by a theoretical calculation based on the kinetic model. The Pu4+ sorption on the resin was driven by a large exothermic enthalpy change (&#916;H = -31.4±2.2 kJ/mol) and a positive entropy change (&#916;S = 224±15 J/mol/L). The resin could sorb a maximum of 12.1±0.8 mg of Pu per gram of resin, which is equivalent to 1:2 metal/ligand complex on the resin. The Pu4+ from the resin phase was completely stripped with 0.5 M oxalic acid. A possible application of this resin for the separation / pre-concentration of Pu4+ was successfully demonstrated in the column mode.","Banerjee, Piyali; Ansari, Seraj A; Mohapatra, Prasanta K; Egberink, Richard J M; Valsala, Thichur P; Sathe, Darshan B; Bhatt, Raj B; Huskens, Jurriaan; Verboom, Willem",J Chromatogr A,121,16

Travel was inevitably associated with the rapid global transmission of COVID-19. In the UK, public health authorities took action to reduce risks of travel-associated spread by providing public health information at ports of entry. This study aims to understand individual risk assessment processes, decision making, and adherence to official advice among international travellers; to provide evidence to inform future policy on the presentation of public health information to facilitate safer international travel. Study designThis study is a qualitative study evaluation. MethodSemi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate risk assessment processes, decision making, and adherence to official Public Health England (PHE) advice among travellers. ResultsParticipants regarded official advice as adequate at the time, despite observing differences between the intervention measures implemented in the countries of departure. Participants however also described adopting precautionary measures including self-isolation and the use of face coverings that went beyond official advice, and variability in the extent to which they adhered to guidance on contacting health authorities. Adherence to official guidance was informed by the perceived salience of specific transmission possibilities and containment measures assessed in relation to participants social and institutional environments. ConclusionAnalysis of travellers reported motivations demonstrates that responses to public health advice constitute a proactive process of risk assessment and rationalised decision-making that incorporates consideration of living situation, trust in information sources, correspondence with cultural logics, and willingness to accept potential risk to self and significant others in guiding preventive action. Our findings concerning international passengers understanding of, and compliance with, official advice and mitigation measures provide valuable evidence to inform future policy and we provide recommendations on the presentation of public health information to facilitate safer international travel. Access to a central source of regularly updated official information would help minimise confusion between different national guidelines. Greater attention to the differentiated information needs of diverse groups in creating future public-facing guidance would help to minimise the uncertainties generated by receipt of generic information.","Cai, Shenghan; Zhang, Tingting; Robin, Charlotte; Sawyer, Clare; Rice, Wendy; Smith, Louise E.; Amlôt, Richard; Rubin, G.

In this study, a pooled effect of lopinavir-ritonavir on mortality, virological cure, radiological improvement and safety profile in COVID-19 patients has been evaluated. METHODS: The databases were searched for comparative randomized controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 patients. The mortality outcome was pooled as a risk difference (RD) with 95% CI. The virological cure, radiological improvement and adverse events were pooled as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. All outcomes were pooled using the Mantle-Hanzle method random effect model. The heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test. RESULTS: Out of 82 full text assessed, seven studies were included in the analysis. The included studies had five different control interventions: supportive care (n=4), umifenovir (arbidol) (n=2), navaferon (recombinant anti-tumour and anti-virus protein) (n=1), lopinavir-ritonavir+novaferon (n=1) and lopinavir-ritonavir+interferon beta 1b+ribavirin (n=1). Lopinavir-ritonavir group did not show significant difference in mortality [RD: 0.00 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.02), I2=0], virological cure [RR: 1.06 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.31), I2=0%], radiological improvement [RR: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.05)] and adverse events [RR: 2.59 (95% CI: 0.17, 38.90), I2=75%] than supportive care. Similarly, no difference was observed for any efficacy outcomes between lopinavir-ritonavir and other control interventions. We observed significantly high risk of adverse events with lopinavir-ritonavir as compared to umifenovir [RR: 2.96 (95% CI: 1.42-6.18); I2=0%]. CONCLUSION: There is no benefit of the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir to the standard care in COVID-19 patients.","Patel, Tejas K; Patel, Parvati B; Barvaliya, Manish; Saurabh, Manoj Kumar; Bhalla, Hira Lal; Khosla, Prem Parkash",J Infect Public Health,121,24

It is important that the obtained knowledge is human-interpretable and amenable to formal analysis. In this paper, we propose a method that trains neural networks to learn spatial-temporal properties in the form of weighted graph-based signal temporal logic (wGSTL) formulas. For learning wGSTL formulas, we introduce a flexible wGSTL formula structure in which the user's preference can be applied in the inferred wGSTL formulas. In the proposed framework, each neuron of the neural networks corresponds to a subformula in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We initially train a neural network to learn the wGSTL operators and then train a second neural network to learn the parameters in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We use a COVID-19 dataset and a rain prediction dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed framework with three baseline classification methods including K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed framework is comparable with the baseline classification methods.","Baharisangari, Nasim; Hirota, Kazuma; Yan, Ruixuan; Julius, Agung; Xu, Zhe",,121,1

Across the United States, social distancing measures have been put in place, including stay-at-home orders (SAH), to combat the spread of this infection. This has impacted the type and volume of traumatic injuries sustained during this time. Meanwhile, steps have been taken in our healthcare system to assure that adequate resources are available to maintain a high standard of patient care while recognizing the importance of protecting healthcare providers. Using comparative data, we aim to describe the trends in traumatic injuries managed by our Plastic Surgery service and detail the changes in consultation policies made to minimize provider exposure. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all plastic surgery emergencies at our institution during the 3 weeks preceding the issuance of SAH orders in Chicago and the 3 weeks following. The electronic medical record was queried for patient age, type and mechanism of injury, location where injury was sustained, presence of domestic violence, length of inpatient hospital stays and treatment rendered. The two 3-week periods were then comparatively analyzed to determine differences and trends in these variables. and treatment rendered. The two periods were then comparatively analyzed to determine differences and trends in these variables. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in trauma consults since issuance of SAH (88 pre-SAH vs 62 post-SAH) with a marked decrease in trauma related hand injuries. There was an increase in the percentage of assault-related injuries including those associated with domestic violence, while there was an overall decrease in motor vehicle collisions. There was no notable change in the location where injuries were sustained. Significantly fewer patients were seen by house staff in the emergency room, while those requiring surgical intervention were able to receive care without delay. CONCLUSION: Stay-at-home orders in Chicago have impacted traumatic injury patterns seen by the Section of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at a Level I Trauma Center. Safe and timely care can continue to be provided with thorough communication, vigilance and guidance from our colleagues.","Hassan, Kareem; Prescher, Hannes; Wang, Frederick; Chang, David W; Reid, Russell R",Ann. plast. sur,121,28

Most infected people have symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, tiredness, and fever. However, the Covid-19 infection disrupts various organs, including the liver, kidney, and nervous system. Common neurological symptoms of the Covid-19 infection include delirium, confusion, headache, and loss of sense of smell and taste. In rare cases it can cause stroke and epilepsy. The virus enters the nervous system either directly through nerve pathways or indirectly through the ACE2 receptor. The neurological symptoms of a Covid-19 infection in the brain are mainly due to either the entry of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the nervous system or the production of these cytokines by microglia and astrocytes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can cause blood-brain barrier disruption, increase in glutamate and aspartate and reduce GABA levels, impairs the function of ion channels, and finally, high levels of cytokines can cause epilepsy. Understanding the potential mechanisms is necessary to gain better insight into COVID-19 induced seizure pathogenesis and to design the correct treatment strategies to achieve appropriate treatment for seizure and epilepsy.","Nikbakht, Farnaz; Mohammadkhanizadeh, Ali; Mohammadi, Ekram",Mult Scler Relat Disord,121,16

Exacerbated inflammation and dysregulated immune responses involving T and myeloid cells occur in COVID-19 patients with severe clinical progression. However, the differential contribution of specific subsets of dendritic cells and monocytes to ARDS is still poorly understood. In addition, the role of CD8+ T cells present in the lung of COVID-19 patients and relevant for viral control has not been characterized. Here, we have studied the frequencies and activation profiles of dendritic cells and monocytes present in the blood and lung of COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity in comparison with healthy individuals. Furthermore, these subpopulations and their association with antiviral effector CD8+ T cell subsets were also characterized in lung infiltrates from critical COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that inflammatory transitional and nonclassical monocytes and CD1c+ conventional dendritic cells preferentially migrate from blood to lungs in patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, this study increases the knowledge of specific myeloid subsets involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease and could be useful for the design of therapeutic strategies for fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sánchez-Cerrillo, Ildefonso; Landete, Pedro; Aldave, Beatriz; Sánchez-Alonso, Santiago; Sánchez-Azofra, Ana; Marcos-Jiménez, Ana; Ávalos, Elena; Alcaraz-Serna, Ana; de Los Santos, Ignacio; Mateu-Albero, Tamara; Esparcia, Laura; López-Sanz, Celia; Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; Gabrie, Ligia; Del Campo Guerola, Luciana; de la Fuente, Hortensia; Calzada, María J; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Alfranca, Arantzazu; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Muñoz-Calleja, Cecilia; Soriano, Joan B; Ancochea, Julio; Martín-Gayo, Enrique",J Clin Invest,121,20

How long these droplets persist in the air, how far they can travel, and how long the pathogens they might carry survive are all decisive factors for the spread of droplet-borne diseases. The subject is extremely multifaceted and its aspects range across different disciplines, yet most of them have only seldom been considered in the physics community. In this review, we discuss the physical principles that govern the fate of respiratory droplets and any viruses trapped inside them, with a focus on the role of relative humidity. Importantly, low relative humidity---as encountered, for instance, indoors during winter and inside aircraft---facilitates evaporation and keeps even initially large droplets suspended in air as aerosol for extended periods of time. What is more, relative humidity affects the stability of viruses in aerosol through several physical mechanisms such as efflorescence and inactivation at the air-water interface, whose role in virus inactivation nonetheless remains poorly understood. Elucidating the role of relative humidity in the droplet spread of disease would permit us to design preventive measures that could aid in reducing the chance of transmission, particularly in indoor environment.","Bovzivc, Anvze; Kanduvc, Matej",,121,1

The purpose of this review is to synthesize the available knowledge on the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women as well as the risk of maternal-fetal transmission. The study indicated that the course of COVID-19 is worse in pregnant women who are more often admitted to intensive care units or who require mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant women with COVID-19. Some symptoms, such as dyspnea and cough, were similar to those observed in nonpregnant women, but fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, and diarrhea were less frequent. A study revealed that premature delivery and cesarean section were more common in pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. In addition, recent studies confirm the possibility of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission by positive genetic tests and the presence of IgM in newborns just after delivery; at the moment, the probability of transmission through mother's milk is inconclusive. Considering all the above, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is an important factor that threatens the health and life of both the mother and the fetus, but further studies are still needed.","Mazur-Bialy, Agnieszka Irena; Kolomanska-Bogucka, Daria; Tim, Sabina; Oplawski, Marcin",,121,10

Early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients may be beneficial to reduce morbidity and in-hospital mortality. This study aimed to investigate whether baseline levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and immune-cell-based inflammatory indices, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived-NLR (d-NLR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) at hospital admission are associated with adverse disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Methods Clinical data from 391 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in three Siloam Hospitals in Indonesia were retrospectively collected and analysed from March 20 to October 30, 2020. Results Fifty-four (13.8%) hospitalized patients had clinical deterioration and required ICU treatment, categorizing them as severe COVID-19 cases. Older age, presence of underlying diseases, and increased inflammatory markers values at admission were significantly associated with severe cases. After adjustment of sociodemographic and comorbidities factors, CRP, NLR, and d-NLR values, but not PLRs, were identified as independent risk factors for disease severity and death in COVID-19 patients. The area under curve (AUC) of CRP, NLR, and d-NLR were 0.854, 0.848, and 0.854, respectively. The optimal cut-off points for CRP, NLR, and d-NLR for identification of COVID-19 patients with potential worse disease outcomes were 47 mg/L, 6, and 4, respectively. Conclusion Initial assessment of CRP, NLR, and d-NLR values at hospital admission may be important predictors for adverse disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Prasetya, Ignatius Bima Cucunawangsih Lorens Jane Olivia Sungono Veli El-Khobar Korri Elvanita Wijaya Ratna Sari",Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,121,24

The risk of spreading the virus is high, and procedures for viral load reduction in the oral cavity are important. Little research to date has been performed on the effect of mouthwashes on the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This pilot randomized single-center clinical trial investigated whether three types of mouthwash with solutions containing either 0.075% cetylpyridinium chloride plus 0.28% zinc lactate (CPC+Zn), 1.5% hydrogen peroxide (HP), or 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva at different time points. Sixty SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited and randomly partitioned into a placebo (oral rinsing with distilled water) group and other groups according to the type of mouthwash. Saliva samples were collected from the participants before rinsing (T0), immediately after rinsing (T1), 30 min after rinsing (T2), and 60 min after rinsing (T3). The salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by qRT-PCR assays. Rinsing with HP and CPC+Zn resulted in better reductions in viral load, with 15.8±0.08- and 20.4±3.7-fold reductions at T1, respectively. Although the CPC+Zn group maintained a 2.6±0.1-fold reduction at T3, this trend was not observed for HP. HP mouthwash resulted in a significant reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 viral load up to 30 min after rinsing (6.5±3.4). The CHX mouthwash significantly reduced the viral load at T1, T2, and T3 (2.1±1.5-, 6.2±3.8-, and 4.2±2.4-fold reductions, respectively). In conclusion, mouthwash with CPC+Zinc and CHX resulted in significant reductions of the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva up to 60 mins after rinsing, while HP mouthwash resulted in a significant reduction up to 30 mins after rinsing. Despite this transitory effect, these results encourage further studies and suggest that these products could be considered as risk-mitigation strategies for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","de Paula Eduardo, Fernanda Corrêa Luciana Heller Debora Daep Carlo Amorin Benitez Carlos Malheiros Zilson Stewart Bernal Ryan Maria Machado Clarisse Martins Hamerschlak Nelson Pinho João Renato Rebello Bezinelli Letícia Mello",Heliyon,121,16

COVID-19 is more severe in people with diabetes. The identification of risk factors for predicting disease severity in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is urgently needed. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-six patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. The patients were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 patients with or without T2DM. The patients were further divided into four subgroups according to the severity of COVID-19 as follows: Subgroup A included moderate COVID-19 patients without diabetes, subgroup B included severe COVID-19 patients without diabetes, subgroup C included moderate COVID-19 patients with diabetes, and subgroup D included severe COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The clinical features and radiological assessments were collected and analyzed. We tracked the dynamic changes in laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes during the hospitalization period. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to analyze the risk factors that predict the severity of COVID-19 with T2DM. RESULTS: Firstly, compared with the nondiabetic group, the COVID-19 with T2DM group had a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), and procalcitonin (PCT) but lower lymphocyte counts and T lymphocyte subsets, including CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD16â¯+â¯CD56 cells, and CD19+ cells. Secondly, compared with group A, group C had higher levels of Fasting blood glucose (FBG), IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and neutrophils but lower lymphocyte, CD3+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+ T cell counts. Similarly, group D had higher FBG, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; levels and lower lymphocyte, CD3+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+ T cell counts than group B. Thirdly, binary logistic regression analysis showed that HbA1c, IL-6, and lymphocyte count were risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 with T2DM. Importantly, COVID-19 patients with T2DM were more likely to worsen from moderate to severe COVID-19 than nondiabetic patients. Of note, lymphopenia and inflammatory responses remained more severe throughout hospitalization for COVID-19 patients with T2DM. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that COVID-19 patients with T2DM are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 than those without T2DM and that hyperglycemia associated with the lymphopenia and inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients with T2DM.","Cheng, Yangyang; Yue, Ling; Wang, Zhiyang; Zhang, Junxia; Xiang, Guangda",J Diabetes Complications,121,16

DESIGN: Modelling study. SETTING: England and India. PARTICIPANTS: Individual data were obtained from the fourth round of the District Level Household Survey and Annual Health Survey in India, and aggregate data were obtained from the Health Survey for England and the Global Burden of Disease, Risk Factors and Injuries Studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the modelled age-specific mortality in each country due to each COVID-19 mortality risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, obesity and respiratory illness, among others). The change in overall mortality and in the share of deaths under age 60 from the combination of risk factors was estimated in each country. RESULTS: Relative to England, Indians have higher rates of diabetes (10.6% vs 8.5%) and chronic respiratory disease (4.8% vs 2.5%), and lower rates of obesity (4.4% vs 27.9%), chronic heart disease (4.4% vs 5.9%) and cancer (0.3% vs 2.8%). Population COVID-19 mortality in India, relative to England, is most increased by uncontrolled diabetes (+5.67%) and chronic respiratory disease (+1.88%), and most reduced by obesity (-5.47%), cancer (-3.65%) and chronic heart disease (-1.20%). Comorbidities were associated with a 6.26% lower risk of mortality in India compared with England. Demographics and population health explain a third of the difference in share of deaths under age 60 between the two countries. CONCLUSIONS: Known COVID-19 health risk factors are not expected to have a large effect on mortality or its age distribution in India relative to England. The high share of COVID-19 deaths from people under age 60 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unexplained. Understanding the mortality risk associated with health conditions prevalent in LMICs, such as malnutrition and HIV/AIDS, is essential for understanding differential mortality.","Novosad, Paul; Jain, Radhika; Campion, Alison; Asher, Sam",BMJ Open,121,1

In contrast, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons and the European Association of Endoscopic Surgery recommend continuing to use laparoscopy but with devices to filter released CO2 aerosol particles. However, commercially available systems are costly and may not be readily available. Herein, we describe a custom-made system to safely remove surgical smoke and CO2, as well as a case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in which we used it. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: The patient had had multiple episodes of biliary pancreatitis and required urgent cholecystectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although India was in complete lockdown, it was decided to operate with precaution. A system was designed using underwater seal chest tube drainage and an electrostatic membrane filter with a viral retention function greater than 99.99%. The system was connected to an extra port for continuous controlled egression of CO2 pneumoperitoneum. A regular four-port cholecystectomy was performed at an intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mm Hg. The gas flow rate was 10 L/min. CO2 for pneumoperitoneum, surgical aerosol, and effluents passed through the system before collecting in the suction apparatus. The exchange of operating instruments through the ports was kept to a minimum. It was done after the abdomen was temporarily desufflated using this system. DISCUSSION: The system we designed appears safe and is cost-effective. In resource-limited settings, it will be handy in patients requiring laparoscopic surgery both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bhattacharjee, Hemanga K; Chaliyadan, Shafneed; Verma, Eshan; Ramachandran, Rashmi; Makharia, Govind; Parshad, Rajinder",Asian j. endosc. surg,121,16

This triggered the imposition of generalisd quarantine ('lockdown') of variable stringency in different countries: with the decrease of the epidemic, the lockdown is now gradually relaxed and replaced by tight tracing and isolation of new cases and their contacts. Prevention, however, remains not a constant priority, as the objective may be avoidance of saturation of intensive care beds or more generally of healthcare facilities rather than the minimisation of the disease incidence. This combined with the fact that notwithstanding repeated warnings in past years the epidemic occurred as a surprise denotes a way of thinking in which prevention is an important option but not a guiding principle of choice and action within the health system. To modify this way of thinking and place prevention at the core of the system, non-negligible changes are required: they may become possible in light of emerging hazards like new viruses and climate change, huge economic costs of failed prevention and initial changes in the health system already induced by the COVID-19 epidemic.","Saracci, Rodolfo",J Epidemiol Community Health,121,1

The goal of this study was to better understand the regulation of innate IFN-lambda responses in vitro in primary human infant airway epithelial cells (AECs) and in vivo using nasal aspirates during viral respiratory infections. METHODS: IFN-lambda protein levels were quantified: (a) in human infant AECs exposed to (poly(I:C) dsRNA) under different experimental conditions (n = 8 donors); and (b) in nasal aspirates of young children (&#8804;3 years) hospitalized with viral respiratory infection (n = 138) and in uninfected controls (n = 74). In vivo IFN-lambda airway levels during viral infections were correlated with individual characteristics and respiratory disease parameters. RESULTS: Our in vitro experiments showed that the poly(I:C)-induced innate production of IFN lambda in human infant AECs is regulated by (a) p38-MAPK/NF-kB dependent mechanism; and (b) exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as IL1ß. Our in vivo studies demonstrated that (a) infants (<18 months) had higher virus-induced IFN-lambda airway secretion; (b) subjects with RSV infection showed the highest IFN-lambda airway levels; and (c) individuals with the highest virus-induced IFN-lambda levels (>90th percentile) had higher viral loads and were more likely to have respiratory sick visits within 12 months of discharge (OR = 5.8). CONCLUSION: IFN-lambda responses to dsRNA in the human infant airway epithelium are regulated by p38-MAPK and NF-kB signalling. High in vivo IFN-lambda production is influenced by virus type and associated with recurrent respiratory sick visits in young children.,"Salka, Kyle; Arroyo, Maria; Chorvinsky, Elizabeth; Abutaleb, Karima; Perez, Geovanny F; Wolf, Seth; Xuchen, Xilei; Weinstock, Jered; Gutierrez, Maria J; Pérez-Losada, Marcos; Pillai, Dinesh K; Nino, Gustavo",Clin Exp Allergy,121,16

A Reemerging Concept,11.856368,8.466669,2020,"Every year, millions of Americans get sick from foodborne illness and it is estimated half of all reported instances occur at restaurants. To protect the public, regulators are encouraged to conduct restaurant inspections and disclose reports to consumers. However, inspection reporting format is inconsistent and typically contains information unclear to most consumers who often misinterpret the inspection results. Additionally, consumers are increasingly searching for this information in a digital context. Limited research explores inspection reports as communication tools. Using affect-as-information and ELM as theoretical frameworks, this experiment investigated how discrete emotions (e.g., disgust) conveyed through pictorial cues (i.e., emojis) influenced consumers' processing of inspection reports. Participants, recruited from Amazon's MTurk, were randomly assigned to one of six experimental conditions in a 3 (emoji: smiling vs. disgusted vs. none) x 2 (violation level: low vs. high) between-subjects design. Then, participants completed a questionnaire regarding perceptions and cognitive processing of the message. Results revealed that, compared to text, disgusted face emoji increased risk perceptions and avoidance behavior. In terms of emotion, smiling face emoji motivated participants to feel more emotions related to sanitation. In turn, positive feelings decreased elaboration likelihood. As predicted by ELM, involvement also predicted elaboration, such that participants who were highly involved with inspection reports elaborated more than those less involved. Involvement also moderated the relationship between emoji presented and elaboration. Practical implications are also discussed.","Ray, Elizabeth C; Merle, Patrick F",Health Commun,121,5

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020. Blood and urine laboratory findings related to renal function were summarized, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) were also calculated to assess the renal function. Results: A total of 12 admitted hospital patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, included 3 severe cases, and 9 common cases. Serum creatinine (Scr) was not abnormally elevated in all of the patients, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was abnormally elevated in only 25.0% of the patients. However, compared with the recovery period, the patient's Scr and BUN increased significantly in peak of disease (p-scr = 0.002 & p-bun &lt; 0.001). By observing the fluctuations in Scr and BUN from admission to recovery, it was found that the peak of Scr and BUN appeared within the first 14 day of the course of the disease. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the abnormally elevated rates of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), and urine transferring (TRU) standardized by urinary creatinine in peak of disease were 41.7, 41.7, 50.0, and 16.7%, respectively. The abnormal rates of the calculated eGFR and Ccr were 66.7 and 41.7%. Conclusion: Scr and BUN were generally increased during the course of COVID-19. Detection of urinary microproteins and application of multiple indicators assessment could be helpful for discovering abnormal renal function in patients with COVID-19. However, the evidence is limited due to the small sample size and observational nature. Additional studies, especially large prospective cohort studies, are required to confirm these findings.","Hong, Xu-Wei; Chi, Ze-Pai; Liu, Guo-Yuan; Huang, Hong; Guo, Shun-Qi; Fan, Jing-Ru; Lin, Xian-Wei; Qu, Liao-Zhun; Chen, Rui-Lie; Wu, Ling-Jie; Wang, Liang-Yu; Zhang, Qi-Chuan; Wu, Su-Wu; Pan, Ze-Qun; Lin, Hao; Zhou, Yu-Hua; Zhang, Yong-Hai",Front.

A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple 500 ns or 1 µs all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493 and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the ACE2-SARS-CoV interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area based free energy of binding was observed to be higher for SARS-CoV-2 in all simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.","Ali, Amanat; Vijayan, Ranjit",Sci Rep,121,20

The aim of the present study is to dissect the chemical composition and the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QFPD), a clinically used Chinese medicine for treating COVID-19 patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), a total of 129 compounds of QFPD were putatively identified. We also constructed molecular networking of mass spectrometry data to classify these compounds into 14 main clusters, in which exhibited specific patterns of flavonoids (45 %), glycosides (15 %), carboxylic acids (10 %), and saponins (5 %). The target network model of QFPD, established by predicting and collecting the targets of identified compounds, indicated a pivotal role of Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSG) in the therapeutic efficacy of QFPD. Supportively, through transcriptomic analysis of gene expression after MXSG administration in rat model of LPS-induced pneumonia, the thrombin and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway were suggested to be essential pathways for MXSG mediated anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, changes in content of major compounds in MXSG during decoction were found by the chemical analysis. We also validate that one major compound in MXSG, i.e. glycyrrhizic acid, inhibited TLR agonists induced IL-6 production in macrophage. In conclusion, the integration of in silico and experimental results indicated that the therapeutic effects of QFPD against COVID-19 may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of MXSG, which supports the rationality of the compatibility of TCM.","Yang, Ruocong; Liu, Hao; Bai, Chen; Wang, Yingchao; Zhang, Xiaohui; Guo, Rui; Wu, Siying; Wang, Jianxun; Leung, Elaine; Chang, Hang; Li, Peng; Liu, Tiegang; Wang, Yi",Pharmacol Res,121,26

Emerging evidence suggests that pandemic situations and associated lockdowns have an adverse impact on sleep and mental health. However, prediction of sleep health from sociodemographic characteristics and the public's worry during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been extensively explored so far. It's also unclear whether sleep outcomes mediate the association between worry and mental health during pandemic situations. A web-survey (N = 391) on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related worry, sleep health (insomnia and daytime sleepiness), and depression was conducted during the initial 21-days of the COVID-19 stringent lockdown in India. Multiple regression analyses showed that variables, including sex, age, income level, and worry score, contributed to the significant regression equation for insomnia but not for daytime sleepiness. Specifically, the female, younger, lower income, and highly worried populations contributed significantly more than the male, elderly, higher income, and less worried populations, respectively, to the prediction of insomnia. Mediation analyses showed that insomnia, but not daytime sleepiness, fully mediated the relationship between worry score and severity of depressive symptoms. We provide evidence that the female, younger, lower income, and worried populations may be at higher risk for insomnia during pandemic situations. Current evidence gives hope that improving sleep may reduce depressive symptoms during a pandemic situation.

METHODS: In this study, we used a large number of COVID-19 negative patient samples (n = 2030) as well as COVID-19 positive patient samples (n = 112) to compare the performance of four serological assay platforms; Siemens Healthineers Atellica IM Analyzer, Siemens Healthineers Dimension EXL Systems, Abbott ARCHITECT, and Roche cobas. RESULTS: All four serology assay platforms exhibited comparable negative percent agreement with negative COVID-19 status ranging from 99.2-99.7%, and positive percent agreement from 84.8-87.5% with positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. Of the 2142 total samples, only 38 samples (1.8%) yielded discordant results on one or more platforms. However, only 1.1% (23/2030) of COVID-19 negative cohort results was discordant whereas discordance was 10-fold higher for the COVID-19 positive cohort at 11.3% (15/112). Of the total 38 discordant results, 34 were discordant on only one platform. CONCLUSION: Serology assay performance was comparable across the four platforms assessed in a large population of COVID-19 negative patients with relevant comorbidities. The pattern of discordance shows that samples were discordant on a single assay platform, and discordance rate was 10-fold higher in the COVID-19 positive population. IMPACT STATEMENT: High negative percent agreement reinforces the reliability of serology testing especially in a cohort of at-risk patients. Serology platform discordance highlights the importance of a two-test strategy for properly identifying seroconverted patients.","Ward, Matthew D; Mullins, Kristin E; Pickett, Elizabeth; Merrill, VeRonika; Ruiz, Mark; Rebuck, Heather; Duh, Show-Hong; Christenson, Robert H",,121,3

Yet, despite being armed with the required information and guidance for self-management, self-care and adherence to foot self-care recommendations and compliance to medication among patients with diabetic foot ulcer and diabetic lower extremity amputations remain low and suboptimal. This study reveals in-depth account of nine such patients' beliefs and perceptions around their illness, their self-care, and their health-seeking behaviours. Patients living with diabetic lower extremity amputation displayed profound lack of knowledge of self-care of diabetes and foot and passive health-related behaviours. The overarching sense that ""when nothing happens, nobody is afraid,"" points to a lack of motivation in taking charge of one's own health, whether this is with reference to treatment or care adherence, following recommended self-care advice, or seeking timely treatment. The Health Beliefs Model provides the theoretical framework for probing into the factors for the participants' suboptimal self-care and passive health-seeking behaviours. Two themes emerged from data analysis: profound knowledge deficit and passive health-related behaviours. The beliefs and perceptions around self-care and health-seeking behaviours for patients with lower extremity amputation are interpreted as the ""ignorant self"" with passive health-seeking behaviours. Patients with diabetes and diabetic foot diseases may benefit from personalized education, motivational interviewing, and family support.","Zhu, Xiaoli; Lee, Mary; Chew, Evelyn Al; Goh, Ling Jia; Dong, Lijuan; Bartlam, Bernadette",Int. wound j,121,33

To gain a complete understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect commercial driver stress, health, and safety over time, and to mitigate these impacts, research and prevention efforts must be grounded in theoretical perspectives that contextualize these impacts within the chronic stressors already endemic to profession, the historical and ongoing forces that have induced them, and the potentially reinforcing nature of the resulting afflictions. Methods: Extant literature reveals how an array of macro-level changes has shaped downstream trucking industry policies, resulting in stressogenic work organization and workplace characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing stressors and introduces novel stressors, with potentially exacerbatory impacts on health and safety disparities. Results: As COVID-19 exerts an array of multi-level stressors on commercial drivers, syndemic frameworks can provide the appropriate theoretical lens to guide research and prevention. Syndemic frameworks can provide the grounding to allow foregoing commercial driver COVID-19 research to transcend the limitations of prevailing research frameworks by contextualizing COVID-19 stressors holistically within the complex system of endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety afflictions. Syndemic-informed prevention efforts can then be implemented that simultaneously tackle multiple afflictions and the macro-level forces that result in the emergence of commercial drivers' health and safety disparities over time. Conclusions: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial drivers cannot be adequately understood or acted upon in isolation from the endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety disparities that characterize the profession. Instead, commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention needs syndemic frameworks to holistically understand the impacts of COVID-19 on commercial driver stress, health, and safety, and to identify high-leverage preventive actions.","Lemke, Michael Kenneth; Apostolopoulos, Yorghos; Sönmez, Sevil",J Transp Health,121,21

In this observational study we recorded objective data on sleep macro- and microarchitecture repeatedly over several nights before and during the Covid-19 government-imposed lockdown. The main objective was to evaluate changes in patterns of sleep duration and architecture during home confinement using the pre-confinement period as a control. METHODS: Participants were regular users of a sleep-monitoring headband that records, stores, and automatically analyses physiological data in real time, equivalent to polysomnography. We measured: sleep onset duration (SOD), total sleep time (TST), duration of sleep stages (N2, N3 and REM), and sleep continuity. Via the user's smartphone application participants filled-in questionnaires on how lockdown changed working hours, eating behaviour, and daily-life at home. They also filled-in the Insomnia Severity Index, reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires allowing us to create selected sub-groups. RESULTS: The 599 participants were mainly men (71%) of median age 47 [IQR: 36;59]. Compared to before lockdown, during lockdown individuals slept more overall (mean +3·83 min; SD: ±1.3), had less deep sleep (N3), more light sleep (N2) and longer REM sleep (mean +3·74 min; SD: ±0.8). They exhibited less week-end specific changes, suggesting less sleep restriction during the week. Changes were most pronounced in individuals reporting eveningness preferences, suggesting relative sleep deprivation in this population and exacerbated sensitivity to societal changes. CONCLUSIONS: This unique dataset should help us understand the effects of lockdown on sleep architecture and on our health.","Pépin, Jean-Louis; Bailly, Sébastien; Mordret, Ernest; Gaucher, Jonathan; Tamisier, Renaud; Ben Messaoud, Raoua; Arnal, Pierrick J; Mignot, Emmanuel",Sleep,121,26

For the treatment of flu disease, both antivirals and vaccines are available with vaccines the most effective and safest approach. In order to overcome limitations in egg-based vaccine manufacturing, cell culture-based processes have been established. While this production method avoids egg-associated risks in face of pandemics, process intensification using animal suspension cells in high cell density perfusion cultures should allow to further increase manufacturing capacities worldwide. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a perfusion process using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) suspension cells for influenza A (H1N1) virus production from scale-down shake flask cultivations to laboratory scale stirred tank bioreactors. Shake flask cultivations using semi-perfusion mode enabled high-yield virus harvests (4.25 log10(HAU/100 µL)) from MDCK cells grown up to 41 × 106 cells/mL. Scale-up to bioreactors with an alternating tangential flow (ATF) perfusion system required optimization of pH control and implementation of a temperature shift during the infection phase. Use of a capacitance probe for on-line perfusion control allowed to minimize medium consumption. This contributed to a better process control and a more economical performance while maintaining a maximum virus titer of 4.37 log10(HAU/100 µL) and an infectious virus titer of 1.83 × 1010 virions/mL. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates recent advances in cell culture-based perfusion processes for next-generation high-yield influenza vaccine manufacturing for pandemic preparedness.

Study Design: The study was a randomized clinical trial including 90 patients who just completed head- and neck-radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: Participants were randomly allocated into three equal sized groups, i.e., probiotics group, candid group, and combination groups. Oral rinse samples of the patients were collected before and after the intervention for the identification of Candida. The samples were incubated on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar with Chloramphenicol at 37°C for 48 h, to assess the counts of colony-forming units/milliliter (CFU/ml) of Candida in saliva, and further on chrome agar plates to identify the Candida spp. Data were analyzed using mixed ANOVA to compare mean CFU/ml of Candida among three groups before and after the intervention. Results: A total of 86 patients were included in the final analysis and there was a statistically significant reduction in mean Candida spp. Counts (CFU/ml) after intervention in all the three groups (P = 0.000) and significant reductions identified in both probiotic and combination therapy groups. Apart from reduction in Candida albicans, significant decrease in Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis was observed after probiotics usage compared to other groups. Conclusions: The present study suggests that probiotic bacteria were effective in reducing oral Candida spp which can be recommended alone or in combination with traditional antifungal agents for effective reduction in oral Candida in head- and neck-radiotherapy patients.","Doppalapudi, Radhika; Vundavalli, Sudhakar; Prabhat, M P",J Cancer Res Ther,121,33

This study aimed to investigate the association between the micronutrient levels and hemogram values and prognostic factors of the disease in COVID-19 patients in Ankara City Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study is a descriptive observational study based on a retrospective review of patient files. COVID-19 patients over 18 years of age who were admitted to our hospital between 14 March and 1 June 2020, and with a complete micronutrient profile were included in the study. Age, gender, chronic diseases, micronutrient concentrations in the last 6 months, hemogram data on the day of hospitalization, total length of stay in hospital, and hospitalization to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)-intubation-death status of the patients were obtained from the patient files. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients whose parameters were thoroughly examined were included in our study; 51.9% of them were men and the mean age of all patients was 57.02 ± 18.28 years, and the most common comorbid disease was hypertension. The percentage of patients who were followed in the ICU, were intubated, and died was 34.5%, 13.9%, and 9.4%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 15.87 ± 12.79 days. Low folate, iron, vitamin D, and hemoglobin levels of the patients and high vitamin B12 concentration were more related to poor prognostic factors. The number of white blood cells was significantly higher in patients with a worse prognosis, and the number of lymphocytes was lower in patients with ICU admission but higher in intubated and dead patients. CONCLUSION: Micronutrient and hemogram values, advanced age, being male, and having comorbid diseases were correlated with the poor prognosis of COVID-19 infection. Deficiency of Iron, Folate, and vitamin D should be well-considered in COVID-19. Excessive vitamin B12 and multivitamin supplementation should be avoided by choosing supplement wisely. In addition, attention should be paid to leukocytosis, lymphocyte counts, and anemia during COVID-19 patient follow-up. What's known Some micronutrients have an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect with antioxidant effects and thus play a protective role in respiratory tract infections as COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency is found to be associated with poor prognostic factors in COVID-19. Lymphopenia is found to be associated with poor prognostic factors in COVID-19. What's new According to the results obtained from our study, low iron and folate levels should be controlled first in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, low vitamin D levels should also be well-considered, and supplementation should be provided in the case of deficiencies. On the other hand excessive use of vitamin B12 should be avoided. The fact that all micronutrients should be evaluated and managed by choosing wisely rather than a complete multivitamin supplement approach was demonstrated by the differences in the poor prognosis levels of vitamin B12 versus the other micronutrients. In addition, it was found in our study that leukocytosis, lymphocyte counts, and anemia should be taken into consideration together when evaluating hemogram parameters in the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.","Ersöz, Aysegül; Yilmaz, Tarik Eren",Int J Clin Pract,121,16

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The TR-MRF technique consists of repeated MRF acquisitions using an unbalanced steady-state free precession sequence with spiral-in-spiral-out trajectory. TR-MRF was first tested via computer simulation using a 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom for both regular and irregular breathing profiles, and was tested in three healthy volunteers. Parametric MRF maps at different respiratory phases were subsequently estimated using our TR-MRF sorting and reconstruction techniques. The resulting TR-MRF maps were evaluated using a set of metrices related to radiotherapy applications, including absolute difference in motion amplitude, error in the amplitude of diaphragm motion (ADM), tumor volume error (TVE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and tumor contrast. RESULTS: TR-MRF maps with regular and irregular breathing were successfully generated in XCAT phantom. Numerical simulations showed that the TVE were 1.6±2.7% and 1.3±2.2%, the average absolute differences in tumor motion amplitude were 0.3±0.7 mm and 0.3±0.6 mm ,and the ADM were 4.1±0.9% and 3.5±0.9% for irregular and regular breathing respectively. The SNR of the T1 and T2 maps of the liver and the tumor were generally higher for regular breathing compared to irregular breathing, whereas tumor-to-liver contrast is similar between the two breathing patterns. The proposed technique was successfully implemented on the healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: We have successfully demonstrated in both digital phantom and health subjects a novel TR-MRF technique capable of imaging respiratory motions with simultaneous quantification of MR multi-parametric maps.","Li, Tian; Cui, Di; Hui, Edward S; Cai, Jing",Med. phys,121,24

Some countries proposed universal mask wearing as a protection measure of public health to strengthen national prevention efforts and to limit the wider spread of the epidemic. In order to reveal the epidemic prevention efficacy of masks, this paper systematically evaluates the experimental studies of various masks and filter materials, summarises the general characteristics of the filtration efficiency of isolation masks with particle size, and reveals the actual efficacy of masks by combining the volume distribution characteristics of human exhaled droplets with different particle sizes and the SARS-CoV-2 virus load of nasopharynx and throat swabs from patients. The existing measured data show that the filtration efficiency of all kinds of masks for large particles and extra-large droplets is close to 100%. From the perspective of filtering the total number of pathogens discharged in the environment and protecting vulnerable individuals from breathing live viruses, the mask has a higher protective effect. If considering the weighted average filtration efficiency with different particle sizes, the filtration efficiencies of the N95 mask and the ordinary mask are 99.4% and 98.5%, respectively. The mask can avoid releasing active viruses to the environment from the source of infection, thus maximising the protection of vulnerable individuals by reducing the probability of inhaling a virus. Therefore, if the whole society strictly implements the policy of publicly wearing masks, the risk of large-scale spread of the epidemic can be greatly reduced. Compared with the overall cost of social isolation, limited personal freedoms and forced suspension of economic activities, the inconvenience for citizens caused by wearing masks is perfectly acceptable.","Wei, Jincheng; Guo, Shurui; Long, Enshen; Zhang, Li; Shu, Bizhen; Guo, Lei",Epidemiol Infect,121,24

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of mortality among ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 123 patients with COVID-19 in the ICU of Vulcan Hill Hospital were retrospectively selected from the database, and the data were randomly divided into a training data set (n=98) and test data set (n=25) with a 4:1 ratio. Significance tests, correlation analysis, and factor analysis were used to screen 100 potential risk factors individually. Conventional logistic regression methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to construct the risk prediction model for the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The performance of these machine learning models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Interpretation and evaluation of the risk prediction model were performed using calibration curves, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), etc, to ensure its stability and reliability. The outcome was based on the ICU deaths recorded from the database. RESULTS: Layer-by-layer screening of 100 potential risk factors finally revealed 8 important risk factors that were included in the risk prediction model: lymphocyte percentage, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, eosinophil percentage, creatinine, neutrophil percentage, and albumin level. Finally, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model established with the 8 important risk factors showed the best recognition ability in the training set of 5-fold cross validation (AUC=0.86) and the verification queue (AUC=0.92). The calibration curve showed that the risk predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual risk. In addition, using the SHAP and LIME algorithms, feature interpretation and sample prediction interpretation algorithms of the XGBoost black box model were implemented. Additionally, the model was translated into a web-based risk calculator that is freely available for public usage. CONCLUSIONS: The 8-factor XGBoost model predicts risk of death in ICU patients with COVID-19 well; it initially demonstrates stability and can be used effectively to predict COVID-19 prognosis in ICU patients.","Pan, Pan; Li, Yichao; Xiao, Yongjiu; Han, Bingchao; Su, Longxiang; Su, Mingliang; Li, Yansheng; Zhang, Siqi; Jiang, Dapeng; Chen, Xia; Zhou, Fuquan; Ma, Ling; Bao, Pengtao; Xie, Lixin",J Med Internet Res,121,16

Due to its rapid dissemination and high mutation rate, it is essential to develop a vaccine harboring multiple epitopes and efficacious against multiple variants to prevent the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2. An in silico approach based on the viral genome was applied to identify 19 high-immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted T-cell epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo-Suite and manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis confirmed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four peptide candidates derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly larger amount of total IgG in serum, as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in the inguinal lymph nodes, were observed in the peptide-immunized mice compared to the control. The ratios of IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells in the peptide-immunized mice were higher than those in the control mice. There were also a larger number of IFN-γ-secreting T-cells in the spleens of peptide-immunized mice. The peptide vaccines in this study successfully elicited antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. To further validate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine, animal studies using a primate model, as well as clinical trials in humans, are required.","Feng, Ye Jiang Haiping Qiu Min Liu Liang Zou Shengmei Li Yun Guo Qianpeng Han Ning Sun Yingqiang Wang Kui Lu Lantian Zhuang Xinlei Zhang Shanshan Chen Shuqing Mo Fan",Pathogens,121,21

Concerns exist that these disruptions caused by the pandemic may not have influenced men and women researchers equally. Many medical journals have published papers on the pandemic, which were generated by researchers facing the challenges of these disruptions. Here we report the results of an analysis that compared the gender distribution of authors on 1893 medical papers related to the pandemic with that on papers published in the same journals in 2019, for papers with first authors and last authors from the United States. Using mixed-effects regression models, we estimated that the proportion of COVID-19 papers with a woman first author was 19% lower than that for papers published in the same journals in 2019, while our comparisons for last authors and overall proportion of women authors per paper were inconclusive. A closer examination suggested that women's representation as first authors of COVID-19 research was particularly low for papers published in March and April 2020. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the research productivity of women, especially early-career women, has been affected more than the research productivity of men.","Andersen, Jens Peter; Nielsen, Mathias Wullum; Simone, Nicole L; Lewiss, Resa E; Jagsi, Reshma",eLife (Cambridge),121,9

The continent's governments have responded by imposing rigorous lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus. The various lockdown measures are undermining food security, because stay at home orders have among others, threatened food production for a continent that relies heavily on agriculture as the bedrock of the economy. This article draws on quantitative data collected by the GeoPoll, and, from these data, assesses the effect of concern about the local spread and economic impact of COVID-19 on food worries. Qualitative data comprising 12 countries south of the Sahara reveal that lockdowns have created anxiety over food security as a health, economic and human rights/well-being issue. By applying a probit model, we find that concern about the local spread of COVID-19 and economic impact of the virus increases the probability of food worries. Governments have responded with various efforts to support the neediest. By evaluating the various policies rolled out we advocate for a feminist economics approach that necessitates greater use of data analytics to predict the likely impacts of intended regulatory relief responses during the recovery process and post-COVID-19.","Chiwona-Karltun, Linley; Amuakwa-Mensah, Franklin; Wamala-Larsson, Caroline; Amuakwa-Mensah, Salome; Abu Hatab, Assem; Made, Nolwandle; Taremwa, Nathan Kanuma; Melyoki, Lemayon; Rutashobya, Lettice Kinunda; Madonsela, Thulisile; Lourens, Marna; Stone, Wendy; Bizoza, Alfred R",Ambio,121,20

Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical diagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians trust in the technology and therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment. However, diagnostic uncertainty in the report is a challenging and yet inevitable task for radiologist. In this paper, we investigate how drop-weights based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in Deep Learning solution to improve the diagnostic performance of the human-machine team using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and show that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlates with accuracy of prediction.

Alternative methods to control the spread of the disease such as social isolation, extreme quarantine measures, and contact tracing have been used around the world. However, these measures may not be totally effective to fight COVID-19, in step with the necessary national preparations to meet the new patient care demands. A wide range of digital technologies can be used to enhance these public health strategies, and the pandemic has sparked increasing use of telehealth. This field has grown considerably in Brazil in recent years. Still, despite the intense proliferation of recommendations and rules, until the current pandemic the country still lacked a fully consolidated regulatory framework. The emergence of COVID-19 marks a key moment in the expansion of applications and use of telehealth for improving the health system's response to the current crisis. The article discusses telehealth's contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and the recent initiatives triggered in Brazil as opportunities for the consolidation of telemedicine and improvement of the Brazilian Unified National Health System. The authors conclude that telehealth offers capabilities for remote screening, care and treatment, and assists monitoring, surveillance, detection, prevention, and mitigation of the impacts on healthcare indirectly related to COVID-19. The initiatives triggered in this process can reshape the future space of telemedicine in health services in the territory.","Caetano, Rosângela; Silva, Angélica Baptista; Guedes, Ana Cristina Carneiro Menezes; Paiva, Carla Cardi Nepomuceno de; Ribeiro, Gizele da Rocha; Santos, Daniela Lacerda; Silva, Rondineli Mendes da",Cad Saude Publica,121,30

The planning in regard to further action for the coming weeks and months has to take place now. Methods: With the help of the principles of the German philosopher Kant, the thinking and planning is framed. Results: The modelling by the researchers of the Imperial College, London, make an oversized second wave in autumn/winter 2020 most likely, if the current countermeasures are kept in place for too long. A timely relaxation of the measures is warranted to allow a staggered attack by the virus onto the population (German: “Durchseuchung”) before the next influenza season 2020/2021 without overburdening the health care infrastructure especially the respiratory care bed capacity. The tempting perspective of a vaccine available before the second wave in autumn, should not lead to any delay in the intermittent relaxation of the countermeasures. A pre-licensure marginally tested vaccine would only be eligible for people with an anyway high risk in regard to SARS-CoV‑2. Conclusions: Further, more detailed and from each other independent models on the basis of data from Germany are urgently needed. Upon these a heterogeneous trans-hierarchical committee would need to discuss and make decisions in regard to differentiated relaxations of measures given the high remaining uncertainties.","Weigl, Josef",Pravent.

However, data describing the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in this group are scarce, and guidance is variable. We aimed to describe the incidence, characteristics, transmission, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates who received inpatient hospital care in the UK. METHODS: We carried out a prospective UK population-based cohort study of babies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first 28 days of life who received inpatient care between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Infected babies were identified through active national surveillance via the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, with linkage to national testing, paediatric intensive care audit, and obstetric surveillance data. Outcomes included incidence (per 10â000 livebirths) of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease, proportions of babies with suspected vertically and nosocomially acquired infection, and clinical outcomes. FINDINGS: We identified 66 babies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence 5·6 [95% CI 4·3-7·1] per 10â000 livebirths), of whom 28 (42%) had severe neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence 2·4 [1·6-3·4] per 10â000 livebirths). 16 (24%) of these babies were born preterm. 36 (55%) babies were from white ethnic groups (SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence 4·6 [3·2-6·4] per 10â000 livebirths), 14 (21%) were from Asian ethnic groups (15·2 [8·3-25·5] per 10â000 livebirths), eight (12%) were from Black ethnic groups (18·0 [7·8-35·5] per 10â000 livebirths), and seven (11%) were from mixed or other ethnic groups (5·6 [2·2-11·5] per 10â000 livebirths). 17 (26%) babies with confirmed infection were born to mothers with known perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, two (3%) were considered to have possible vertically acquired infection (SARS-CoV-2-positive sample within 12 h of birth where the mother was also positive). Eight (12%) babies had suspected nosocomially acquired infection. As of July 28, 2020, 58 (88%) babies had been discharged home, seven (11%) were still admitted, and one (2%) had died of a cause unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERPRETATION: Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is uncommon in babies admitted to hospital. Infection with neonatal admission following birth to a mother with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was unlikely, and possible vertical transmission rare, supporting international guidance to avoid separation of mother and baby. The high proportion of babies from Black, Asian, or minority ethnic groups requires investigation.

Respiratory symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms are often reported among these patients. CASE REPORT Here, we report a case with flank pain. Radiological images were significant for bilateral consolidation, which raised a high suspicion of COVID-19. Hence, on further investigation, he was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. CONCLUSIONS In the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with multiple comorbidities may present atypically. Flank pain, which is not a usual presentation, may raise the suspicion of COVID-19 infection.","Veliyankodan Parambil, Jessiya; Abdulrahman, Rasha; Al-Shokri, Shaikha",Am J Case Rep,121,20

He has no history of previous cardiovascular or respiratory disease, no history of thromboembolism (PTE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). ECG showed atrial fibrillation with HR 120 bpm and incomplete RBBB. Blood pressure was 85/45mmHg with cold periphery. Patient denied any provocable PE risk factors. Bed site POCUS (Point-of-Care Ultrasound) echocardiography was performed immediately in order to evaluate the cause of patient symptoms and hemodynamic instability. Examination showed increased right ventricle (RV) size, reduced RV function (TAPSE 13, TDI S’ 9), presence of McConnell’s sign, severe tricuspid regurgitation with dilated v. cava and signs of pulmonary hypertension. Due to hemodynamic instability and indirect signs of the presence pf pulmonary embolism fibrinolysis with alteplase infusion was applied. Patient hemodynamically stabilized after first hour. Nasopharyngeal smear for SARV CoV-2 was taken due to ongoing pandemic and result come out positive for virus RNK (real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction-PCR). CT angiography was performed which showed large intraluminal thrombi in the right pulmonary artery, extending to left pulmonary artery up to subsegmental level. His D-dimer values were 7813 ng/ml, CRP 123 mg/L. Evaluated sPESI score was 2, which indicated elevated 30-day death risk. Patient remained clinically stable. He was transferred to the infectious disease clinic for further treatment. After two weeks was discharged with recommendations for three months anticoagulation treatment with Rivaroxaban. Patient performed control visit at our clinic after four months. He was stable, asymptomatic with normal right ventricular function. Conclusion: This is case of successful treatment of pulmonary embolism complicated with cardiogenic shock as a first manifestation of COVID-19 infection at our clinic since the start of pandemic. POCUS echocardiography is fast noninvasive method that help us urgently assess the cause of patient instability and guide diagnostic approach and patient management.

Structural and sequence variants in ACE2 gene may affect its expression in different tissues and determine a differential response to SARS-Cov-2 infection and the COVID-19-related phenotype. The present study investigated the genetic variability of ACE2 in terms of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), and expression quantitative loci (eQTLs) in a cohort of 268 individuals representative of the general Italian population. The analysis identified five SNVs (rs35803318, rs41303171, rs774469453, rs773676270, and rs2285666) in the Italian cohort. Of them, rs35803318 and rs2285666 displayed a significant different frequency distribution in the Italian population with respect to worldwide population. The eQTLs analysis located in and targeting ACE2 revealed a high distribution of eQTL variants in different brain tissues, suggesting a possible link between ACE2 genetic variability and the neurological complications in patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to clarify the possible relationship between ACE2 expression and the susceptibility to neurological complications in patients with COVID-19. In fact, patients at higher risk of neurological involvement may need different monitoring and treatment strategies in order to prevent severe, permanent brain injury.","Strafella, Claudia; Caputo, Valerio; Termine, Andrea; Barati, Shila; Gambardella, Stefano; Borgiani, Paola; Caltagirone, Carlo; Novelli, Giuseppe; Giardina, Emiliano; Cascella, Raffaella",,121,14

Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were developed with respect to inter-annual variations, seasonal cycles, holiday effects, diurnal profile, and the non-linear influences of meteorological factors to quantitatively differentiate the lockdown effects and meteorology impacts on concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matters (PM2.5) at 34 sites in the Beijing area. The results revealed that lockdown measures caused large reductions while meteorology offset a large fraction of the decrease in surface concentrations. GAM estimates showed that in February, the control measures led to average NO2 reductions of 19 µg/m3 and average PM2.5 reductions of 12 µg/m3. At the same time, meteorology was estimated to contribute about 12 µg/m3 increase in NO2, thereby offsetting most of the reductions as well as an increase of 30 µg/m3 in PM2.5, thereby resulting in concentrations higher than the average PM2.5 concentrations during the lockdown. At the beginning of the lockdown period, the boundary layer height was the dominant factor contributing to a 17% increase in NO2 while humid condition was the dominant factor for PM2.5 concentrations leading to an increase of 65% relative to the baseline level. Estimated NO2 emissions declined by 42% at the start of the lockdown, after which the emissions gradually increased with the increase of traffic volumes. The diurnal patterns from the models showed that the peak of vehicular traffic occurred from about 12pm to 5pm daily during the strictest control periods. This study provides insights for quantifying the changes in air quality due to the lockdowns by accounting for meteorological variability and providing a reference in evaluating the effectiveness of control measures, thereby contributing to air quality mitigation policies.","Hua, Jinxi; Zhang, Yuanxun; de Foy, Benjamin; Shang, Jing; Schauer, James J; Mei, Xiaodong; Sulaymon, Ishaq Dimeji; Han, Tingting",J Environ Manage,121,1

To date, pathologic analyses have been limited to patient reports and autopsy series. METHODS: We evaluated biopsy samples of native and allograft kidneys from patients with COVID-19 at a single center in New York City between March and June of 2020. We also used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy to examine this tissue for presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The study group included 17 patients with COVID-19 (12 men, 12 black; median age of 54 years). Sixteen patients had comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, malignancy, or a kidney or heart allograft. Nine patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Fifteen patients (88%) presented with AKI; nine had nephrotic-range proteinuria. Among 14 patients with a native kidney biopsy, 5 were diagnosed with collapsing glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with minimal change disease, 2 were diagnosed with membranous glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with crescentic transformation of lupus nephritis, 1 was diagnosed with anti-GBM nephritis, and 4 were diagnosed with isolated acute tubular injury. The three allograft specimens showed grade 2A acute T cell-mediated rejection, cortical infarction, or acute tubular injury. Genotyping of three patients with collapsing glomerulopathy and the patient with minimal change disease revealed that all four patients had APOL1 high-risk gene variants. We found no definitive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney cells. Biopsy diagnosis informed treatment and prognosis in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 develop a wide spectrum of glomerular and tubular diseases. Our findings provide evidence against direct viral infection of the kidneys as the major pathomechanism for COVID-19-related kidney injury and implicate cytokine-mediated effects and heightened adaptive immune responses.","Kudose, Satoru; Batal, Ibrahim; Santoriello, Dominick; Xu, Katherine; Barasch, Jonathan; Peleg, Yonatan; Canetta, Pietro; Ratner, Lloyd E; Marasa, Maddalena; Gharavi, Ali G; Stokes, M Barry; Markowitz, Glen S; D039,; Agati, Vivette D",J Am Soc Nephrol,121,24

However, little is known about pediatricians' experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. METHODS: Data from a nationally representative survey of American Academy of Pediatrics postresidency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n = 744; response rate = 48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which nonusers would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among nonusers, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. CONCLUSION: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth. Reducing barriers will be instrumental in promoting future telehealth adoption. Many barriers have been reduced during the response to COVID-19, and the impact of these policy changes will need further study.","Sisk, Blake; Alexander, Joshua; Bodnar, Chelsea; Curfman, Alison; Garber, Kelli; McSwain, S David; Perrin, James M",Acad Pediatr,121,26

Michigan has been one of the top states affected by COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We describe the emergency center curbside testing procedure implemented at Beaumont Hospital, a large hospital in Royal Oak, MI, and aim to evaluate its safety and efficiency. METHODS: Anticipating a surge in patients requiring testing, Beaumont Health implemented curbside testing, operated by a multidisciplinary team of health care workers, including physicians, advanced practice providers, residents, nurses, technicians, and registration staff. We report on the following outcomes over a period of 26 days (March 12, 2020, to April 6, 2020): time to medical decision, time spent documenting electronic medical records, overall screening time, and emergency center return evaluations. RESULTS: In total, 2782 patients received curbside services. A nasopharyngeal swab was performed on 1176 patients (41%), out of whom 348 (29.6%) tested positive. The median time for the entire process (from registration to discharge) was 28 minutes (IQR 17-44). The median time to final medical decision was 15 minutes (IQR 8-27). The median time from medical decision to discharge was 9 minutes (IQR 5-16). Only 257 patients (9.2%) returned to the emergency center for an evaluation within 7 or more days, of whom 64 were admitted to the hospital, 11 remained admitted, and 4 expired.

It is a new disease and researchers are trying to explore its clinical presentation and outcome to know more about the course of the disease. The objective of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Coronavirus disease-19 associated with severity of the disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar from April to August 2020. All patients presented to the hospital and were diagnosed as COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Disease characteristics and clinical outcomes were noted in both mild and severe cases. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the disease severity and a comparison was made between these groups in terms of demographics, lab parameters and outcomes. Data were analysed by using SPSS version 24. RESULTS: Out of 227 patients, 80.2% (n=182) were males while 19.8% (n=45) were females. The mean age of the patients was 54.44±14.35 yrs. 61.2% (n=139) had co-morbidities with diabetes being the most common. 26.9% (n=61) had severe disease and 18.1% (n=41) died.20.7% (n=47) had lymphopenia, 48.45% (n=110) had leucocytosis and thrombocytopenia was seen in 11.89% (n=27).

The shelf stability of NEW sanitizer was, therefore, assessed under various storage conditions to guide the development of protocols for its industrial application. To that end, fresh NEW with an available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 480 mg/L, pH 6.96, and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of 916 mV was stored under different conditions. These were open or sealed polypropylene bottles, three different surface area-to-volume (SA:V) ratios (0.9, 1.7, and 8.7), and two temperatures (4 and 25°C). NEW stored at 4°C was significantly more stable than NEW stored at 25°C; ACC and pH decreased by 137 mg/L and 0.7, respectively, whereas ORP increased by 23 mV, after 101 days of storage. At 25°C, ACC decreased to <0.01 mg/L after 52 days in bottles with a SA:V ratio of 8.7, with a similar decrease after 101 days in bottles with a SA:V ratio of 1.7. However, pH decreased by up to 3.7 pH units, and ORP increased by up to 208 mV. The antimicrobial efficacy of ""aged"" electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water with different ACC and ORP, but the same pH (i.e., 3.4 ± 0.2), was evaluated against Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua to determine any differences in residual antimicrobial activity. EO water with an ACC of &#8805;7 mg/L and an ORP of 1,094 mV caused a reduction of at least 4.7 log, whereas EO water with nondetectable ACC and considerably high ORP (716 mV) had little antimicrobial effect (<1-log reduction). Results from this study indicate that the efficacy of NEW as a sanitizer for large-scale applications such as horticulture can be maintained for at least 3 months when it is stored in closed containers with low SA:V ratio at low temperatures.","Block, Zachary; Eyles, Alieta; Corkrey, Ross; Stanley, Roger; Ross, Tom; Kocharunchitt, Chawalit",J Food Prot,121,16

This study was performed with the aim to compare the SSI rate in human immunodeficiency virus HIV-positive patients, to identify other risk factors for SSI and to establish a nomogram model to predict the risk of SSI. METHODS: A total of 101 HIV-positive individuals following orthopedic surgery patients admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital. Their characteristics were gathered. The univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the risk factors of SSI. And the Nomogram prediction model was constructed and verified. RESULTS: The independent predictive factors of SSI included CD4 (Odds ratio [OR], 0.041; P = 0.040), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (OR, 89.773; P = 0.030), and procalcitonin (PCT) (OR, 220.746; P = 0.006). The scoring nomogram model was as follows: Logit (SSI) = - 2.63589-0.00314*CD4 < 430.75 = 1) + 0.04695*(ESR < 17.46 = 1) + 2.93694*(PCT < 0.22 = 1). The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.946. The cutoff score was - 2.1026 with a sensitivity of 93.33% and a specificity of 84.88%. CONCLUSIONS: CD4, ESR, PCT might affect the occurrence of SSI after orthopedic surgery. The nomogram model constructed in this study is helpful for predicting the probability of SSI.","Ma, Rui; He, Jie; Xu, Biao; Zhao, Changsong; Zhang, Yao; Li, Xin; Sun, Sheng; Zhang, Qiang",BMC Infect Dis,121,16

FNL in this population can be challenging due to movement, floppy supraglottic structures, or secretions. Laryngeal ultrasound (LUS) may be an alternative, less invasive means of evaluating VFMI that also decreases aerosolization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective was to examine LUS interpretation proficiency for VFMI via an educational module. A secondary outcome was to determine whether quantitative measurements increase interpretation accuracy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort trial. METHODS: Medical students, residents, fellows, faculty, and staff were recruited to complete the module, composed of a 13-minute teaching video followed by 20 cases. Participants determined both qualitatively (subjective assessment) and then quantitatively (through protractor measurements of the vocal fold to arytenoid angle) whether there was normal versus impaired vocal fold mobility. RESULTS: Thirty participants completed the LUS training module, and about one-third were otolaryngology residents. On average, each participant correctly identified 18 cases. The mean rank percent correct for quantitative measurements was significantly higher than that of qualitative interpretations (P < .0001). Measurements significantly caused participants to change their answer correctly compared to incorrectly (P < .0001). As the module progressed, there was no significant trend of more correct interpretations (P = .30). The sensitivity was higher for quantitative interpretations (89.0% vs. 87.3%) but specificity remained unchanged (92.6%). CONCLUSION: Quantitative measurements may increase LUS interpretation accuracy. There was not a specific number of cases interpreted to achieve learning proficiency. LUS is an easily learned method to evaluate for VFMI across all training levels.

Today, it is a pandemic infection, and even if several compounds are used as curative or supportive treatment, there is not a definitive treatment. In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury. In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange. Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab). In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection.","Gallelli, Luca; Zhang, Leiming; Wang, Tian; Fu, Fenghua",J Clin Pharmacol,121,16

The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored.

Based on count data models, we observed that air pollution and meteorological parameters considerably influenced the daily evolution of infections in most affected cities of Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, Jeddah, and Makkah) where the prevalence of the disease was relatively high during summer 2020. Our study suggests that air pollution could be a significant risk factor for respiratory infections and virus transmission.

A substantial portion of this increase is attributable to the widespread access to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, either used alone or encountered as adulterants in heroin or psychostimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine. Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAb) offer prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against opioid overdose by binding to the target opioids in serum, and reducing drug distribution to the brain. Here, the efficacy of anti-fentanyl vaccines and mAb for prevention and reversal of fentanyl-induced overdose was investigated in rats. Rats were immunized with a candidate vaccine consisting of a fentanyl-based hapten (F) conjugated to a diphtheria toxin carrier protein (CRM), or with a control vaccine. Rats were challenged subcutaneously with doses of 0.25 mg/kg fentanyl every 15 minutes to a cumulative dose of 2.25mg/kg, or until cardiac and/or respiratory arrest occurred. Prophylactic immunization with F-CRM was effective in counteracting fentanyl-induced respiratory depression, bradycardia, and antinociception;and reduced the incidence of mortality compared to control. Additionally, a murine anti-fentanyl mAb was isolated from mice immunized against fentanyl. Purified mAb had previously shown pre-exposure efficacy in protecting mice and rats from fentanyl challenges. To evaluate the efficacy of mAb in reversing fentanyl overdose post-exposure, rats were dosed with 0.1-0.5 mg/kg fentanyl, and 15 minutes later received 40 mg/kg mAb, 0.1 mg/kg naloxone, or both intravenously. Within 15 minutes, treatment with mAb reduced fentanyl-induced respiratory depression and bradycardia, and compared favorably to naloxone in terms of the degree and rate of onset of protection.

Specifically, we examined the contribution of personal resources: self-compassion and perceived social support, as well as a couple of COVID-19-related fears of being infected and concern for the foetus, to both the woman's global fear of childbirth (FOC) and her COVID-19-related childbirth anxiety. Participants were Jewish and Arab pregnant women (n = 403) aged 20-47, who completed a set of structured self-report questionnaires from 18 March to 9 April 2020. Findings indicated that Arab women reported higher level of COVID-19-related childbirth anxiety and COVID-19-related fears of being infected and concern for the foetus. In addition, poorer health, being an Arab woman, being in the third trimester, lower self-compassion, and higher COVID-19-related fears contributed significantly to greater COVID-19-related childbirth anxiety. Furthermore, poorer health, being primiparous, at-risk pregnancy, lower self-compassion and higher fear of being infected contributed significantly to greater FOC. Importantly, social support was found to moderate the association between self-compassion and FOC. The results highlight the need to be attentive to pregnant women in times of crisis, and in particular to especially vulnerable subgroups, such as cultural minorities. They also highlight the importance of personal resources that may be applied in targeted interventions to reduce distress in vulnerable populations.","Taubman-Ben-Ari, Orit; Chasson, Miriam; Abu-Sharkia, Salam",Heal. soc. care community,121,16

Methods: We searched four databases for relevant terms related to COVID-19 and liver transplantation and collected both case reports and case series on liver transplantation published up to the end of September 2020. Results: After initial screening of irrelevant articles, 25 studies were included and analyzed in this review. Among the 59 patients included, 78.3% were over 50 years old, and 71.6% were males. The majority of patients (93.3%) were hospitalized. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (72.9%) followed by dyspnea and cough (54.2%). The majority of patients revealed a high level of CRP (64.3%). Moreover, high level ALT, AST and ALP were reported in 64.3, 37.5, 30.5 and 22.2% of patients.

Clinical trials on these vaccines have been published on the general population showing a high efficacy with minor adverse events. However, specific data about the efficacy and safety of these vaccines in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are still lacking. Moreover, the limited availability of these vaccines requires prioritizing some vulnerable categories of patients compared to others.

Early and rapid detection is crucial to control of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While representing the gold standard for early diagnosis, nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 are often complicated and time-consuming. Serological rapid antibody tests are characterized by high rates of false-negative diagnoses, especially during early infection. Here, we developed a novel nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, which integrates nanozyme and enzymatic chemiluminescence immunoassay with the lateral flow strip. The core of our paper test is a robust Co-Fe@hemin-peroxidase nanozyme that catalyzes chemiluminescence comparable with natural peroxidase HRP and thus amplifies immune reaction signal. The detection limit for recombinant spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.1 ng/mL, with a linear range of 0.2-100 ng/mL. Moreover, the sensitivity of test for pseudovirus could reach 360 TCID50/mL, which was comparable with ELISA method. The strip recognized SARS-CoV-2 antigen specifically, and there was no cross reaction with other coronaviruses or influenza A subtypes. This testing can be completed within 16 min, much shorter compared to the usual 1-2 h required for currently used nucleic acid tests. Furthermore, signal detection is feasible using the camera of a standard smartphone. Ingredients for nanozyme synthesis are simple and readily available, considerably lowering the overall cost. In conclusion, our paper test provides a high-sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) approach for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, which should greatly facilitate early screening of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and considerably lower the financial burden on national healthcare resources.","Liu, Dan; Ju, Chenhui; Han, Chao; Shi, Rui; Chen, Xuehui; Duan, Demin; Yan, Jinghua; Yan, Xiyun",Biosens Bioelectron,121,22

Voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1.3 type were discovered both in plasma membrane and in inner mitochondrial membrane (mito Kv1.3 channels). For some time Kv1.3 channels located both in plasma membrane and in mitochondria are considered as a potentially new molecular target in several pathologies including some cancer disorders. Lipophilic non-toxic organic inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels may potentially find a clinical application to support therapy of some cancer diseases such as breast, pancreas and lung cancer, melanoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Inhibition of T lymphocyte Kv1.3 channels may be also important in treatment of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including severe pulmonary complication in corona virus disease Covid 19, however further studies are needed to confirm this supposition. Statins are small-molecule organic compounds, which are lipophilic and are widely used in treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Electrophysiological studies performed in our laboratory showed that statins: pravastatin, mevastatin and simvastatin are effective inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels in cancer cells of human T cell line Jurkat. We showed that application of the statins in the concentration range from 1.5 µM to 50 µM inhibited the channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was the most potent in case of simvastatin and the least potent in case of pravastatin. The inhibition was partially irreversible in case of simvastatin and fully reversible in case of pravastatin and mevastatin. It was accompanied by a significant acceleration of the current inactivation rate without any significant change of the activation rate. Mechanism of the inhibition is probably complex, including a direct interaction with the channel protein and perturbation of lipid bilayer structure, leading to stabilisation of the inactivated state of the channels.","Teisseyre, Andrzej; Uryga, Anna; Michalak, Krystyna",J Mol Struct,121,24

LPV-r had potential DDI with concomitant medications in 97 (78%, 95% CI 69-85%) patients, and in 33 (26%, 95% CI 19-35%) individuals showed major DDI. Twelve (36%) patients with major DDI and 14 (15%) individuals without major DDI died (p = 0.010). After adjustment, only the Charlson index was independently associated with death [adjusted OR (95% CI) for Charlson index &#8805; 5: 85 (10-731), p < 0.001]. LPV-r was discontinued due to side effects in 31 (25%) patients. Management by the Infectious Diseases Unit was associated with a lower likelihood of major DDI [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): 0.14 (0.04-0.53), p = 0.003). In conclusion, a high frequency of DDI between LPV-r for treating COVID-19 and concomitant medications was found, including major DDI. Patients with major DDI showed worse outcomes, but this association was explained by the older age and comorbidities. Patients managed by the Infectious Diseases Unit had lower risk of major DDI.","Macías, Juan; Pinilla, Ana; Lao-Dominguez, Francisco A; Corma, Anaïs; Contreras-Macias, Enrique; González-Serna, Alejandro; Gutierrez-Pizarraya, Antonio; Fernández-Fuertes, Marta; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón; Trigo, Marta; Real, Luis M; Pineda, Juan A",Sci Rep,121,3

Methods: A review of primary data sources in the US was conducted. The data were summarized to describe national and state-level trends in the spread of COVID-19 and in policy and technology solutions. Results: COVID-19 cases and deaths initially peaked in late March and April, but after a brief reduction in June cases and deaths began rising again July and continued to climb into early August. The US policy response is best characterized by its federalist, decentralized nature. The national government has led in terms of economic and fiscal response, increasing funding for scientific research into testing, treatment, and vaccines, and in creating more favorable regulations for the use of telemedicine. State governments have been responsible for many of the containment, testing, and treatment responses, often with little federal government support. Policies that favor economic re-opening are often followed by increases in state-level case numbers, which are then followed by stricter containment measures, such as mask wearing or pausing re-opening plans. Conclusions: While all US states have begun to ""re-open"" economic activities, this trend appears to be largely driven by social tensions and economic motivations than an ability to effectively test and surveil populations.","Bergquist, Savannah; Otten, Thomas; Sarich, Nick",,121,1

DESIGN: Perspective METHODS: Review of studies focused on digital device usage, near work, and outdoor time in relation to myopia onset and progression. Public health policies on myopia control, recommendations on screen time and information pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on increased digital device use were presented. Recommendations to minimize the impact of the pandemic on myopia onset and progression in children were made. RESULTS: Increased digital screen time, near work and limited outdoor activities were found to be associated with the onset and progression of myopia, and could potentially be aggravated during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak period. While school closures may be short-lived, increased access, adoption and dependence on digital devices could have a long term negative impact on childhood development. Raising awareness among parents, children and government agencies is key to mitigating myopigenic behaviours that may become entrenched during this period. CONCLUSIONS: While it is important to adopt critical measures to slow or halt the spread of COVID-19, close collaboration between parents, schools and ministries is necessary to assess and mitigate the long term collateral impact of COVID-19 on myopia control policies.","Wong, Chee Wai; Tsai, Andrew; Jonas, Jost B; Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko; Chen, James; Ang, Marcus; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei",Am. j. ophthalmol,121,10

We present a novel framework to enable situation-aware access control in a federated Data-as-a-Service architecture by using semantic web technologies. Our framework allows distributed query rewriting and semantic reasoning that automatically adds situation based constraints to ensure that users can only see results that they are allowed to access. We have validated our framework by applying it to two dynamic use cases: maritime search and rescue operations and contact tracing for surveillance of a contagious disease. This paper details our implemented solution and experimental results of the two use cases. Our framework can be adopted by organizations that need to share sensitive data securely during dynamic, limited duration scenarios.","Oni, S.; Chen, Z. Y.; Crainiceanu, A.; Joshi, K.

As a way of showing the importance of joint actions in this process, we aim to present the concept of One Conservation as a new proposal for the integration of sustainability, in situ and ex situ conservation for the restoration of ecosystems. According to the United Nations, we are beginning the decade of ecosystem restoration and in association with the International Union for Conservation of Nature guidelines, we can join efforts in the conservation of the planet. The survival of many species of wild animals depends on the management of populations currently maintained in ex situ conditions (under human care). To facilitate the exchange of genetic material between in situ and ex situ populations, reproductive biotechniques have become a great tool, making it possible to restore species in their natural environments. For effective conservation to occur, there must be an integrated view of the problem as a whole, and action for solutions must take place jointly by different spheres of society. Even more, conservation must be carried out by the public sector, the private sector, the third sector, and not less importantly, the agricultural sector. Therefore, One Conservation is defined as an interconnection between ex situ and in situ conservation plans, anthropic actions in the environment, and research in different areas that encompass conservation.","Pizzutto, Cristiane Schilbach; Colbachini, Helen; Jorge-Neto, Pedro Nacib",Animal reproduction,121,17

We investigated the prevalence of new-onset myocarditis/pericarditis and associated adverse cardiovascular events in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records from a global federated health research network. Patients were included based on a diagnosis of COVID-19 and new-onset myocarditis or pericarditis. Patients with COVID-19 and myocarditis/pericarditis were 1:1 propensity score matched for age, sex, race and co-morbidities to patients with COVID-19 but without myocarditis/pericarditis. The outcomes of interest were 6-month all-cause mortality, hospitalisation, cardiac arrest, incident heart failure, incident atrial fibrillation, and acute myocardial infarction, comparing patients with and without myocarditis/pericarditis. Of 718,365 patients with COVID-19, 35,820 (5.0%) developed new onset myocarditis and 10,706 (1.5%) developed new onset pericarditis. Six-month all-cause mortality was 3.9% (n=702) in patients with myocarditis and 2.9% (n=523) in matched controls (P<0.0001), odds ratio 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.53). Six-month all-cause mortality was 15.5% (n=816) for pericarditis and 6.7% (n=356) in matched controls (P<0.0001), odds ratio 2.55 (95% CI: 2.24-2.91). Receiving critical care was associated with significantly higher odds of mortality for patients with myocarditis and pericarditis. Patients with pericarditis seemed to associate with more new-onset cardiovascular sequelae than those with myocarditis. This finding was consistent when looking at pre-COVID-19 data with pneumonia patients. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 who present with myocarditis/pericarditis associate with increased odds of major adverse events and new-onset cardiovascular sequelae.","Buckley, Benjamin J R; Harrison, Stephanie L; Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara; Underhill, Paula; Lane, Deirdre A; Lip, Gregory Y H",European journal of clinical investigation,121,20

In addition, inhibition of α5β1 by the small peptide noncompetitive integrin α5 inhibitor, ATN-161, is beneficial in a mouse model of ischemic stroke through reduction of infarct volume, edema, stabilization of the BBB, and reduced inflammation and immune cell infiltration into the brain. In continuation with our previous findings, we have further evaluated the mechanistic role of ATN-161 in vitro and found that oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial depolarization, and fibrosis attenuate tight junction integrity via induction of α5, NLRP3, p-FAK, and p-AKT signaling in mouse brain endothelial cells. ATN-161 treatment (10 µM) effectively inhibited OGD/R-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by reducing integrin α5, MMP-9, and fibronectin expression, as well as reducing oxidative stress by reducing mitochondrial superoxide radicals, intracellular ROS, inflammation by reducing NLRP3 inflammasome, tight junction loss by reducing claudin-5 and ZO-1 expression levels, mitochondrial damage by inhibiting mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis via regulation of p-FAK and p-AKT levels. Taken together, our results further support therapeutically targeting α5 integrin with ATN-161, a safe, well-tolerated, and clinically validated peptide, in ischemic stroke.

However, data on several aspects of its use such as impact of timing of therapy, efficacy, and safety in this severity category are limited. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of timing of remdesivir initiation (symptom-onset to remdesivir treatment [SORT] interval) on in-hospital all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted between June 25, 2020 and October 3, 2020, at a tertiary care dedicated COVID center in India. Consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (moderate: SpO2 <94%; severe: SpO2 <90%) were included. Data were collected from the health records of the hospital. Remdesivir was administered along with other standard medications as per protocol. The main outcome was the impact of SORT interval on in-hospital all-cause mortality. Subgroups were formed based on SORT interval. Other measures analyzed included overall in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and safety. Results: Of 350 patients treated with remdesivir, 346 were included for the final analysis (males: 270 [78.0%]; median [range] age: 60 [24-94] years). Overall, 243 (70.2%) patients had [≥]1 comorbidity; 109 (31.5%) patients had moderate disease, 237 (68.5%) had severe disease, and 50 (14.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Of the 346 patients, 76 (22.0%) patients died (moderate: 3 [2.8%], severe: 73 [30.8%]). In the subset of mechanically ventilated patients, 43 (86.0%) died. All-cause mortality was significantly lower in patients with SORT interval [≤]9 days (n = 260) compared with those with SORT interval >9 days (n = 86; 18.1% vs 33.7%; P = .004). The odds of death were significantly lower in patients with SORT interval [≤]9 days vs >9 days (odds ratio = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76; P = .004). Adverse events (transaminitis [≥]5 times upper limit of normal or estimated glomerular filtration rate <30ml/min) leading to drug discontinuation were seen in 4 (1.1%) patients. Conclusion: In this large series of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, initiation of remdesivir [≤]9 days from symptom-onset was associated with a significant mortality benefit. These findings indicate a treatment window and reinforce the need for earlier remdesivir initiation in moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection.","Mehta, R.

A successful outcome requires both timely initiation of ECMO before development of irreversible organ injury from severe ARDS and selection of patients with adequate physiologic reserve. We present a 40-year-old healthy male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia not responsive to more conservative options for ARDS management. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) rescue therapy was instituted and after 34 days he was successfully decannulated and eventually discharged from the hospital in good condition. Despite needing ECMO for longer than what is reported in most case reports and series involving patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, our patient made a complete recovery. He was also followed up in an outpatient setting and seen to be doing well. With appropriate patient selection and timely initiation of ECMO, many patients stand to benefit from this treatment. Ensuring that therapy be delivered to these patients when the need arises requires meticulous planning and provision of the appropriate resources. In addition, inflammatory markers may serve as a further guide to decision-making in patients already on ECMO as has already been indicated in the literature.","Mallick, Taha; Barakat, Mark; Baptiste, Trevaughn R; Hasan, Mahera; Engdahl, Ryan",Cureus,121,19

To help contribute to the understanding of crucial knowledge and to further generate new hypotheses relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and human protein interactions, we make use of the information abundant Biomine probabilistic database and extend the experimentally identified SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in silico. We generate an extended network by integrating information from the Biomine database, the PPI network, and other experimentally validated results. To generate novel hypotheses, we focus on the high-connectivity sub-communities that overlap most with the integrated experimentally validated results in the extended network. Therefore, we propose a new data analysis pipeline that can efficiently compute core decomposition on the extended network and identify dense subgraphs. We then evaluate the identified dense subgraph and the generated hypotheses in three contexts: literature validation for uncovered virus targeting genes and proteins, gene function enrichment analysis on subgraphs, and literature support on drug repurposing for identified tissues and diseases related to COVID-19. The majority types of the generated hypotheses are proteins with their encoding genes and we rank them by sorting their connections to the integrated experimentally validated nodes. In addition, we compile a comprehensive list of novel genes, and proteins potentially related to COVID-19, as well as novel diseases which might be comorbidities. Together with the generated hypotheses, our results provide novel knowledge relevant to COVID-19 for further validation.","Guo, Yang; Esfahani, Fatemeh; Shao, Xiaojian; Srinivasan, Venkatesh; Thomo, Alex; Xing, Li; Zhang, Xuekui",bioRxiv,121,24

We report a single center cohort of children with MIS-C, describing the spectrum of presentation, therapies, clinical course, and short-term outcomes. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study from to a tertiary pediatric rheumatology center including patients (aged 1 month to 21 years) diagnosed with MIS-C between April 2020-April 2021. Demographic, clinical, laboratory results and follow-up data were collected through the electronic patient record system and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients with MIS-C were included into the study. Fever was detected in all patients; gastrointestinal system symptoms was found in 67.2% of the patients, rash in 38.8%, conjunctivitis in 31.3%, hypotension in 26.9% myocarditis and/or pericarditis in 22.4%, respectively. Respiratory symptoms were only in 5 patients (7.5%). Kawasaki Disease like presentation was found 37.3 % of patients. The mean duration of hospitalization was 11.8 7.07 days. Fifty- seven patients (85%) received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 45 (67%) received corticosteroids, 17 (25.3%) received anakinra, and one (1.5%) received tocilizumab. Seven of the patients (10.4%) underwent therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). In 21 (31.3%) patients, a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was required in a median of 2 days. The first finding to improve was fever, while the first parameter to decrease was ferritin (median 6.5 days (IQR, 4-11.2 days)). Sixty-five patients were discharged home with a median duration of hospital stay of 10 days (IQR, 7-15 days). CONCLUSION: The patients with MIS-C may have severe cardiac findings and intensive care requirements in admission and hospital follow-up. The vast majority of these findings improve with effective treatment without any sequelae until discharge and in a short time in follow-up. Although the pathogenesis and treatment plan of the disease are partially elucidated, follow-up studies are needed in terms of long-term prognosis and relapse probabilities.","Sözeri, Betül; Çaglayan, Sengül; Atasayan, Vildan; Ulu, Kadir; Coskuner, Taner; Pelin Akbay, Özge; Hasbal Akkus, Canan; Atay, Gürkan; Sali, Enes; Karacan, Mehmet; Öner, Taliha; Erdogan, Seher; Demir, Ferhat",Postgrad. med,121,23

The nucleocapsid protein N is synthesized on free polysomes, whereas the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Glycoprotein E2 present in the RER contains N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides of the mannose-rich type, supporting the concept that glycosylation of this protein is initiated at the co-translational level. In contrast, O-glycosylation of E1 occurs after transfer of the protein to smooth intracellular membranes. Monensin does not interfere with virus budding from the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, but it inhibits virus release and fusion of infected cells. The oligosaccharide side chains of E2 obtained under these conditions are resistant to endoglycosidase H and lack fucose suggesting that transport of this glycoprotein is inhibited between the trans Golgi cisternae and the cell surface. Glycoprotein E1 synthesized in the presence of monensin is completely carbohydrate-free. This observation suggests that the intracellular transport of this glycoprotein is also blocked by monensin.","Niemann, H; Boschek, B; Evans, D; Rosing, M; Tamura, T; Klenk, H D",The EMBO journal,121,24

However, this improvement in skill performance is lost when the skill must be performed under psychological pressure due to ‘choking under pressure.’ The present study will investigate whether this choking effect is caused by an accrual of declarative knowledge during skill practice and could be prevented if a technique (analogy instructions) to minimize the accrual of declarative knowledge during practice is employed. DESIGN: We will use a 2 (Expectation: teach/test) x 2 (Instruction: analogy/explicit) x 2 (Posttest: high-pressure/low-pressure) mixed-factor design, with repeated measures on the last factor. METHODS: A minimum of 148 participants will be quasi-randomly assigned (based on sex) to one of four groups. Participants in the teach/analogy and teach/explicit groups will practice golf putting with the expectation of teaching putting to another participant, and analogy instructions or explicit instructions, respectively. Participants in the test/analogy and test/explicit groups will practice golf putting with the expectation of being tested on their putting, and analogy instructions or explicit instructions, respectively.

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), highly regarded for their regenerative capacities, also possessesremarkable immunoregulatory functions affecting all types of innate and adaptive immune cells. Owing to that, MSCs have been heavily investigated in clinic for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases along with transplant rejection. Extensive research in the last decaderevealed that MSCs carry out most of their functions through paracrine factors which are soluble mediators and extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, including exosomes and microvesicles, are an efficient way of intercellular communication due to their unique ability to carry biological messages such as transcription factors, growth factors, cytokines, mRNAs and miRNAs over long distances. EVs originate through direct budding of the cell membrane or the endosomal secretion pathway and they consist of the cytosolic and membrane components of their parent cell. Therefore, they are able to mimic the characteristics of the parent cell, affecting the target cells upon binding or internalization. EVs secreted by MSCs are emerging as a cell-free alternative to MSC-based therapies. MSC EVs are being tested in preclinical and clinical settings where they exhibit exceptional immunosuppressivecapacity. They regulate the migration, proliferation, activation and polarization of various immune cells, promoting a tolerogenic immune response while inhibiting inflammatory response. Being as effective immunomodulators as their parent cells, MSC EVs are also preferable over MSC-based therapies due to their lower risk of immunogenicity, tumorigenicity and overall superior safety. In this review, we present the outcomes of preclinical and clinical studies utilizing MSC EVs as therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide variety of immunological disorders.","BULUT, Özlem; GÜRSEL, İhsan",Turk J Biol,121,21

Here, we retrospectively analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the epidemiologic characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection among children in Chengdu, one of the largest cities of western China. METHOD: M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed in 33,345 pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms at the Chengdu Women’s & Children’s Central Hospital between January 2017 and December 2020, based on a serum antibody titer of ≥1:160 measured by the passive agglutination assay. Differences in infection rates were examined by sex, age, and temporal distribution. RESULTS: Two epidemic outbreaks occurred between October-December 2017 and April-December 2019, and two infection peaks were detected in the second and fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Due to the public health response to COVID-19, the number of positive M. pneumoniae cases significantly decreased in the second quarter of 2020. The number of M. pneumoniae infection among children aged 3–6 years was higher than that in other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preschool children are more susceptible to M. pneumoniae infection and close contact appears to be the predominant factor favoring pathogen transmission.

It is unclear why in this age group SARS-CoV-2 infection causes more severe disease than in young adults. We hypothesized that differences in SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive cellular immunity induced after infection with human coronaviruses (HCoVs), like OC43 and NL63, were at the basis of the differential mortality (and morbidity) observed after SARS-CoV-2 infection, because a small proportion of HCoV-specific T cells cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Our data demonstrate that pre-existing T cell immunity induced by circulating human alpha- and beta-HCoVs is present in young adult individuals, but virtually absent in older adult subjects. Consequently, the frequency of cross-reactive T cells directed to the novel pandemic SARS-CoV-2 was minimal in most older adults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the presence of cross-reactive T cells to SARS-CoV-2 is compared in young and older adults. Our findings provide at least a partial explanation for the more severe clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in the elderly.

Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others. Nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease: it can potentially be used to describe events, policies or settings. This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic.

It is highly questionable since there is no consensus among the general public despite official recommendations. For the first time, we conduct a panel econometric exercise to assess the dynamic impact of face mask use on both infected cases and fatalities on a global scale. We reveal a negative impact of mask wearing on fatality rates and on the Covid-19 number of infected cases. The delay of action varies from around 7 days to 28 days concerning infected cases but is more longer concerning fatalities. We also document the increasing adoption of mask use over time. We find that population density and pollution levels are significant determinants of heterogeneity regarding mask adoption across countries, while altruism, trust in government and demographics are not. Surprisingly, government effectiveness and income level (GDP) have an unexpected influence. However, strict government policies against Covid-19 have the most significant effect on mask use. Therefore, the most effective way of increasing the level of mask wearing is to enforce strict laws on the wearing of masks.","DAMETTE, O.",,121,1

Posts were categorized based on whether COVID-19 was discussed and theme frequencies were compared. The majority of patients impacted by the pandemic discussed setbacks to care, such as clinic closures. In addition, posts authored by those impacted by COVID-19 contained more negative emotions and fewer positive emotions compared to unaffected users. Despite an increase in setbacks and negative emotions, posts offering support nearly tripled in frequency highlighting the resilience of the IVF community.

However, the impact of natural colds on asthmatic children in the community, particularly in the high-risk urban environment, is less well-defined. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that children with high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced airway function and greater respiratory tract inflammation than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms. METHODS: We studied 53 asthmatic children from Detroit, Michigan during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses for one year. Symptom score, spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and nasal aspirate biomarkers, viral nucleic acid and rhinovirus (RV) copy number were assessed. RESULTS: Of 658 aspirates collected, 22.9% of surveillance samples and 33.7% of respiratory illnesses were virus-positive. Compared to the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds (symptom score ≥5) showed reduced forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25–75), higher nasal mRNA expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10 and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, and higher protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10 and C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCL)-2, CCL4, CCL20 and CCL24. Children with mild (symptom score 1–4) and asymptomatic infections showed normal airway function and fewer biomarker elevations. Virus-negative cold-like illnesses demonstrated increased FeNO, minimal biomarker elevation and normal airflow. RV copy number was associated with nasal chemokine levels but not symptom score.

We compared the pre- and post-survey results to assess for changes in interest, knowledge and perceptions. 74.63% of students in 2018 and 67.7% in 2019 evaluated the session as excellent or good, with knowledge regarding colorectal cancer screening markedly increased after the educational session. Students reported knowledge and access to healthcare among the biggest patient barriers to colorectal cancer screening. Interest in public health increased by 7.5% and 5.6% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The implementation of this interactive educational peer led exercise can increase interest in public health, improve knowledge of colorectal cancer prevention and facilitate discussions of colorectal cancer screening barriers. We hope to encourage other programs to adopt this preliminary model.

METHODS: Patients in a multistate community rheumatology practice network completed surveys from April 2020 to May 2020. Adults with common ARD (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) or non‐ARD (gout, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis) were evaluated. Concerns about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), social distancing, health care disruptions, and telemedicine use were compared in patients with ARD versus non‐ARD, adjusting for demographics, rural residence, and zipcode‐based measures of socioeconomic status and COVID‐19 activity. Factors associated with medication interruptions were assessed in patients with ARD. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 2319/36 193 (6.4%) patients with non‐ARD and 6885/64 303 (10.7%) with ARD. Concerns about COVID‐19 and social distancing behaviors were similar in both groups, although patients receiving a biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor reported greater concerns and were more likely to avoid friends/family, stores, or leaving the house. Patients with ARD were less likely to avoid office visits (45.2% vs. 51.0%, odds ratio [OR] 0.79 [0.70‐0.89]) with similar telemedicine use. Immunomodulatory medications were stopped in 9.7% of patients with ARD, usually (86.9%) without a physician recommendation. Compared with patients with an office visit, the likelihood of stopping medication was higher for patients with a telemedicine visit (OR 1.54 [1.19‐1.99]) but highest for patients with no visits (OR 2.26 [1.79‐2.86]). CONCLUSION: Patients with ARD and non‐ARD reported similar concerns about COVID‐19 and similar social distancing behaviors. Missed office visits were strongly associated with interruptions in immunomodulatory medication.","George, Michael D.; Baker, Joshua F.; Banerjee, Shubhasree; Busch, Howard; Curtis, David; Danila, Maria I.; Gavigan, Kelly; Kirby, Daniel; Merkel, Peter A.; Munoz, George; Nowell, William Benjamin; Stewart, Patrick; Sunshine, William; Venkatachalam, Shilpa; Xie, Fenglong; Curtis, Jeffrey R.",ACR Open Rheumatol,121,28

In all experiments, poults were randomly assigned to three placement times, 6, 30, and 54 h posthatch. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were terminated when poults were 10, 28, and 14 d old, respectively. In Experiment 1, six poults per treatment were sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. In Experiment 2, 12 poults per treatment were sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 28. The objective of Experiment 3 was to determine the effect of delayed placement on dietary MEn. Delaying access to feed and water for 54 h adversely affected BW through 10, 28, and 14 d of age in Experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < or = 0.01). Delayed access to feed and water for 54 h decreased the absolute weights of the small intestine and pancreas and reduced lengths of the small intestine through 5 d posthatch (P < or = 0.05). The relative weights of the small intestine and proventriculus were reduced by delayed access to nourishment through 4 d posthatch. Poults placed on feed at 54 h posthatch had decreased pancreatic amylase activity (P < or = 0.05) at 3 and 4 d, and trypsin activities were depressed at 3 d posthatch (P < or = 0.05). In Experiment 3, dietary MEn value determined at 4 d of age with poults placed 54 h posthatch was less (P < or = 0.07) than the MEn value obtained with poults placed at 6 h posthatch. A 54-h delay in access to feed and water generally delayed development of the digestive system, impaired nutrient utilization, and reduced BW.","Corless, AB; Sell, JL",Poultry Science,121,20

Adherence is a key to ensure effectiveness. The objective of this study was, first of all, to evaluate the adherence with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and to identify the main causes of SCIT withdrawal in real-life practice in our clinic. Secondly, to investigate to what extent COVID-19 pandemic altered our SCIT receiving patients’ treatment adherence behaviors and the factors that affected their decisions. Methods Retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients ages ≥18 years, who had started SCIT in January 2014 or later until September 2020 in our department for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma or venom allergy were included in the study. Adherence was determined as the accomplishment of three years of SCIT. Results A total of 124 patients (72 female [58.1%]; median age, 35 [19-77] years) were included. The adherence rate to SCIT in our tertiary center’s real-life setting was 56.25% with a follow-up duration of 3 years before COVID-19 pandemic. Dose modification, defined as reducing patient's planned SCIT dose due to a systemic allergic/large local reaction or missed injection, and its frequency, which is the number of dose adjustments done throughout the SCIT, was found to be the only factor related to nonadherence. But with the pandemic only in 6 months, among 63 patients receiving SCIT, 15 patients (23.81%) dropped out and the most common reason was fear of being infected with COVID-19 virus during receiving SCIT in hospital (93.33%). The only independent predictor of drop-out during COVID-19 pandemic was short duration of AIT (p=0.012). When we compare the dropped-out cases before and after the start of pandemic AIT duration was significantly shorter in pandemic period (p= 0.005). Conclusion Adherence rate to SCIT in our real-world setting study was 56.25% before COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicated that patients requiring dose modification were more prone to be non-adherent. Approximately a quarter of patients dropped-out with the start of pandemic, almost all due to fear of being infected during receiving SCIT in hospital. Since short SCIT follow-up time was found to be the only risk factor for drop-out during COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that patients who are in the early phases of their treatment should be observed more closely and their concerns should be answered by their doctors.","Koca Kalkan, Ilkay; Ates, Hale; Aksu, Kurtulus; Yesilkaya, Selma; Topel, Musa; Cuhadar Ercelebi, Dilek; Turkyilmaz, Suleyman; Oncul, Ali; Demir, Senay",World Allergy Organ J,121,16

In the absence of specific vaccines or therapeutics available, COVID-19 cases are managed empirically with the passive immunity approach and repurposing of drugs used for other conditions. Recently, a concept that bacilli Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccination could confer protection against COVID-19 has emerged. The foundation for this widespread attention came from several recent articles, including the one by Miller et al. submitted to MedRxiv, a pre-print server. The authors of this article suggest that a correlation exists between countries with a prolonged national BCG vaccination program and the morbidity/mortality due to COVID-19. Further, clinical BCG vaccination trials are currently ongoing in the Netherlands, Australia, the UK, and Germany with the hope of reducing mortality due to COVID-19. Although BCG vaccination helps protect children against tuberculosis, experimental studies have shown that BCG can also elicit a non-specific immune response against viral and non-mycobacterial infections. Here, we summarize the pros and cons of BCG vaccination and critically analyze the evidence provided for the protective effect of BCG against COVID-19 and highlight the confounding factors in these studies.","Gopalaswamy, Radha; Ganesan, Natarajan; Velmurugan, Kalamani; Aravindhan, Vivekanandhan; Subbian, Selvakumar",Vaccines (Basel),121,1

AIM: To examine the relationship between disease severity and the number of SPCs on admission. Methodology. This observational, prospective, single‐center study included patients with suspected COVID-19 infection who had been transferred to the ICU. A specialized intensivist in critical care ultrasound performed lung ultrasound (LUS) and echocardiography within 12 hours of a patient's admission to the ICU. The aeration score was calculated, and the total number of SPCs was quantified in 12 zones of the LUS. RESULTS: Of 109 patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, 77 (71%) were confirmed. The median patient age was 53 (82–36) years, and 81 of the patients (73.7%) were men. The aeration score and the counts of subpleural consolidation in each zone were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (P=0.018 and P < 0.0001, respectively). There was an inverse relationship between PO(2)/FiO(2), the aeration score, and the number of subpleural consolidations. The higher the number of SPCs, the worse the PO(2)/FiO(2) will be. CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic SPC counts correlate well with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and PO(2)/FiO(2). The number of SPCs should be considered when using LUS to assess disease severity.","Bitar, Zouheir Ibrahim; Shamsah, Mohammed; Maadarani, OssamaSajeh; Bamasood, Omar Mohammed; Bitar, Ali Zouheir; Alfoudri, Huda",Crit Care Res Pract,121,20

Despite advances in vaccine and antiviral drug technology, each year over three million people die from a range of viral infections. Predominant viruses include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis viruses, and gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. Now more than ever, robust, easily mobilised and cost-effective antiviral strategies are needed to combat both known and emerging disease threats. RNA interference and small interfering (si)RNAs were initially hailed as a “magic bullet”, due to their ability to inhibit the synthesis of any protein via the degradation of its complementary messenger RNA sequence. Of particular interest was the potential for attenuating viral mRNAs contributing to the pathogenesis of disease that were not able to be targeted by vaccines or antiviral drugs. However, it was soon discovered that delivery of active siRNA molecules to the infection site in vivo was considerably more difficult than anticipated, due to a number of physiological barriers in the body. This spurred a new wave of investigation into nucleic acid delivery vehicles which could facilitate safe, targeted and effective administration of the siRNA as therapy. Amongst these, cationic polymer delivery vehicles have emerged as a promising candidate as they are low-cost and easy to produce at an industrial scale, and bind to the siRNA by non-specific electrostatic interactions. These nanoparticles (NPs) can be functionally designed to target the infection site, improve uptake in infected cells, release the siRNA inside the endosome and facilitate delivery into the cell cytoplasm. They may also have the added benefit of acting as adjuvants. This chapter provides a background around problems associated with the translation of siRNA as antiviral treatments, reviews the progress made in nucleic acid therapeutics and discusses current methods and progress in overcoming these challenges. It also addresses the importance of combining physicochemical characterisation of the NPs with in vitro and in vivo data.","Reynolds, Nicholas; Dearnley, Megan; Hinton, Tracey M.",Top Curr Chem (Cham),121,23

Exposure metrics are typically developed for specific research initiatives using disparate exposure assessment methods and no mechanisms are put in place for centralizing, archiving, or distributing environmental datasets. In parallel, potentially vast amounts of environmental data are emerging due to new technologies such as high resolution imagery and machine learning. OBJECTIVES: The Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE) and the Geoscience and Health Cohort Consortium (GECCO) provide a proof of concept that centralizing and disseminating environmental data for health research is valuable and can accelerate discovery. In this essay, we argue that more efficient use of exposure data for environmental epidemiological research over the next decade requires progress in four key areas: metadata and data access portals, linkage with health databases, harmonization of exposure measures and models over large areas, and leveraging “big data” streams for exposure characterization and evaluation of temporal changes. DISCUSSION: Optimizing the use of existing environmental data and exploiting emerging data streams can provide unprecedented research opportunities in environmental epidemiology through a better characterization of individuals’ exposures and the ability to study the intersecting impacts of multiple environmental features or urban attributes across different populations around the world. Proper documentation, linkage, and dissemination of new and emerging exposure data leads to a better awareness of data availability, a reduction of duplication of effort and increases research output.","Brook, Jeffrey R.; Doiron, Dany; Setton, Eleanor; Lakerveld, Jeroen",Environ Epidemiol,121,16

Despite the severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), there are currently no drugs available for their treatment; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are urgently needed. To search for effective inhibitory agents, we performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of a 2,000-compound library of approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds using the established genetically engineered human CoV OC43 (HCoV-OC43) strain expressing Renilla luciferase (rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc) and validated the inhibitors using multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro. We screened 56 hits from the HTS data and validated 36 compounds in vitro using wild-type HCoV-OC43. Furthermore, we identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. Additionally, we found that emetine blocked MERS-CoV entry according to pseudovirus entry assays and that lycorine protected BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This represents the first demonstration of in vivo real-time bioluminescence imaging to monitor the effect of lycorine on the spread and distribution of HCoV-OC43 in a mouse model. These results offer critical information supporting the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Currently, there is no approved therapy to treat coronavirus infection; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are needed. Based on our high-throughput screening assay using a compound library, we identified seven compounds with broad-spectrum efficacy against the replication of four CoVs in vitro. Additionally, one compound (lycorine) was found to protect BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This inhibitor might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combatting novel CoV infections in the future.","Shen, Liang; Niu, Junwei; Wang, Chunhua; Huang, Baoying; Wang, Wenling; Zhu, Na; Deng, Yao; Wang, Huijuan; Ye, Fei; Cen, Shan; Tan, Wenjie",Journal of Virology,121,22

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: This study was conducted at Dschang District Hospital of the Menoua Division, West Region of Cameroon, between April–November 2019 and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Participants aged ≥2 years (mean 34±18.77 years) and of both sex suspected of having typhoid fever were included, while non-suspected typhoid cases were excluded. Self-reported sociodemographic and health information at recruitment was obtained from 556 participants. METHODS: Collected stool samples were examined macroscopically and microscopically and subjected to culture. After culture, Gram staining was performed, followed by biochemical testing and characterisation using the Analytical Profile Index (API-20E) test kit. INTERVENTIONS’: No intervention was done during the period of study. OUTCOME MEASURES: We identified bacterial causing gastroenteritis, and associated risk factors calculated using binary regression, adjusting for sociodemographic and health variables. RESULTS: Of 556 patients, 74.28% tested positive for gastroenteritis. Among pathogens responsible for gastroenteritis, Escherichia coli was found to be the main cause (21.1%), followed by Salmonella typhi (10.4%), Citrobacter diversus (8.2%), and Proteus mirabilis (8.2%), Proteus vulgaris (7.3%), whereas Citrobacter spp and Yersinia enterocolitica were less represented among pathogens causing the disease among patients. A significant difference (p=0.002) was observed between abdominal pain and all the micro-organisms isolated from the patients. Patients having primary level of education were significantly associated (p=0.017; 3.163 (95% CI 1.228 to 8.147)) with the prevalence of gastroenteritis. Consumption of beverages (Wald statistic: 4.823; OR: 2.471; 95% CI (1.102 to 5.539); p=0.028), use of modern toilet (Wald statistic: 4.471; OR: 1.723; 95% CI (1.041 to 2.852); p=0.034) were strongly associated with gastroenteritis and rearing of bird (Wald statistic: 4.880; OR: 0.560; 95% CI (0.335 to 0.937); p=0.027), was found to be protective. CONCLUSION: Acute bacterial gastroenteritis is a significant cause of morbidity in Dschang, with the prevalence of 74.28%. Many pathogens accounted for gastroenteritis, and E. coli (21.1%) could be a major cause, followed by S. typhi (10.4%), C. diversus (8.2%), P. mirabilis (8.2%), P. vulgaris (7.3%), whereas Citrobacter spp and Y. enterocolitica were less represented. Gastroenteritis was highly associated with primary level of education, consumption of beverages, use of modern toilet while rearing of birds was unexpectedly found to be protective against Gastroenteritis.

Multiplex microbead-based immunoassays revealed some levels of cytokine production sustained from acute infection to recovery phase. Several proinflammatory and activated T lymphocyte-associated cytokines correlated positively with CEC measures, implicating cytokine-driven endothelial dysfunction. Finally, the activation markers detected on CECs mapped to the counter receptors (i.e. ITGAL, SELPLG, and CX3CR1) found primarily on CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells, suggesting that activated endothelial cells could be targeted by cytotoxic effector cells.

Italy was one of the countries most affected by both the pandemic and the related infodemic. The success of anti–COVID-19 strategies and future public health policies in Italy cannot separate itself from the containment of fake news and the divulgation of correct information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on web interest in conspiracy hypotheses and risk perception of Italian web users. METHODS: Google Trends was used to monitor users’ web interest in specific topics, such as conspiracy hypotheses, vaccine side effects, and pollution and climate change. The keywords adopted to represent these topics were mined from Bufale.net—an Italian website specializing in detecting online hoaxes—and Google Trends suggestions (ie, related topics and related queries). Relative search volumes (RSVs) of the time-lapse periods of 2016-2020 (pre–COVID-19) and 2020-2021 (post–COVID-19) were compared through percentage difference (∆(%)) and the Welch t test (t). When data series were not stationary, other ad hoc criteria were used. The trend slopes were assessed through Sen slope (SS). The significance thresholds have been indicatively set at P=.05 and t=1.9. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically increased Italian netizens’ interest in conspiracies (∆(%) ∈ [60, 288], t ∈ [6, 12]). Web interest in conspiracy-related queries across Italian regions increased and became more homogeneous compared to the pre–COVID-19 period (average RSV=80±2.8, t(min)=1.8, ∆(min%)=+12.4, min∆(SD%)=–25.8). In addition, a growing trend in web interest in the infodemic YouTube channel ByoBlu has been highlighted.

Equivalently, web interest in vaccine side effects exceeded interest in pollution and climate change (SS(vaccines)=0.22, P<.001 vs SS(pollution)=0.05, P<.001; ∆(%)=+296.4). To date, a significant amount of fake news related to COVID-19 vaccines, unproven remedies, and origin has continued to circulate. In particular, the creation of SARS-CoV-2 in a Chinese laboratory constituted about 0.04% of the entire web interest in the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has given a significant boost to web interest in conspiracy hypotheses and has made it more uniform across regions in Italy. The pandemic accelerated an already-growing trend in users’ interest toward some fake news sources, including the 500,000-subscriber YouTube channel ByoBlu, which was removed from the platform by YouTube for disinformation in March 2021. The risk perception related to COVID-19 vaccines has been so distorted that vaccine side effect–related queries outweighed those relating to pollution and climate change, which are much more urgent issues. Moreover, a large amount of fake news has circulated about COVID-19 vaccines, remedies, and origin. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the Italian authorities implement more effective infoveillance systems, and that communication by the mass media be less sensationalistic and more consistent with the available scientific evidence. In this context, Google Trends can be used to monitor users’ response to specific infodemiological countermeasures. Further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that regulate risk perception.","Rovetta, Alessandro",JMIR Infodemiology,121,23

The response of the EU Member States was asymmetrical, individualistic and significantly slow. The first measures taken were to close down the internal borders. The response of the European Union was even slower, and it was not until 17th March 2020 that the external borders were closed. These actions affected legal migration into the European Union from four perspectives: it affected 1) the mobility of those third-country nationals who were on a temporary stay in the EU Member States; 2) the entry of third-country nationals to do seasonal work; 3) legal migrants entering and staying; and 4) the status of the third-country nationals already residing in the EU Member States, especially those experiencing a loss of income. This article will deal with the measures taken by the EU Member States to manage the immigration services, as a case study how Luxembourg dealt to avoid that temporary staying migrants and regular migrants fall into irregularity. Finally, we will focus on the vulnerability of third-country nationals with the rising risk of unemployment and the risk of being returned to their country of origin.

High well-being is an intrinsically worthy goal for individuals, communities and nations. Multiple measures of well-being exist, yet we lack information to identify benchmarks, geographical disparities and targets for intervention to improve population life evaluation in the USA. DESIGN: Using data from the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index, we conducted retrospective analyses of a series of cross-sectional samples. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We summarised select well-being outcomes nationally for each year, and by county (n=599) over two time periods, 2008–2012 and 2013–2017. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We report percentages of people thriving, struggling and suffering using the Cantril Self-Anchoring Scale, percentages reporting high or low current life satisfaction, percentages reporting high or low future life optimism, and changes in these percentages over time. RESULTS: Nationally, the percentage of people that report thriving increased from 48.9% in 2008 to 56.3% in 2017 (p<0.05). The percentage suffering was not significantly different over time, ranging from 4.4% to 3.2%. In 2013–2017, counties with the highest life evaluation had a mean 63.6% thriving and 2.3% suffering while counties with the lowest life evaluation had a mean 49.5% thriving and 6.5% suffering, with counties experiencing up to 10% suffering, threefold the national average. Changes in county-level life evaluation also varied. While counties with the greatest improvements experienced 10%–15% increase in the absolute percentage thriving or 3%–5% decrease in absolute percentage suffering, most counties experienced no change and some experienced declines in life evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of the US population thriving increased from 2008 to 2017 while the percentage suffering remained unchanged. Marked geographical variation exists indicating priority areas for intervention.","Riley, Carley; Herrin, Jeph; Lam, Veronica; Hamar, Brent; Witters, Dan; Liu, Diana; Krumholz, Harlan M; Roy, Brita",BMJ Open,121,3

Most countries in the world have undergone emergency lockdown in an attempt to flatten the curve and reduce the load on healthcare systems. OBJECTIVE: This study was done to assess the knowledge, attitude, and perception toward the disease among the home-bound Indian population during the lockdown. METHODOLOGY: This was a questionnaire-based descriptive cross-sectional study conducted online. Compilation and assessment of the online data in the form of responses were done as for descriptive studies. RESULTS: Among the 320 participants of the study, the awareness about the epidemiological features, including the signs and symptoms of the disease, was very good (more than 99% in some aspects). The attitude toward the measures for prevention of disease at home and outside was also very good (more than 97%) in some aspects, with a scope of improvement in a few others. Only one-third had the knowledge of online (e-consultation) services floated by governments and hospitals for medical advice. Ten percent had the potential to misuse drugs as prophylaxis. Most of the participants perceived that they had no predictable idea about the shape of disease epidemiology in the near future and only hoped for things to get better. CONCLUSION: This study reflects that aggressive awareness drives have played an important role in the dissemination of knowledge and the development of informed positive attitude toward COVID-19. Few gaps in knowledge and practices related to disease epidemiology, safe practices, mobile app for tracking and the availability of e-resources for medical advice, still remain. These should be addressed more aggressively, to strengthen the efforts to overcome this unprecedented crisis.","Tandon, Tanya; Dubey, Ashok K.; Dubey, Suparna; Manocha, Sachin; Arora, Ekta; Hasan, Md Nazer",J Family Med Prim Care,121,16

The global total tropospheric ozone burden declined by 6TgO(3) (∼2%) in May and June 2020, largely due to emission reductions in Asia and the Americas that were amplified by regionally high ozone production efficiencies (up to 4 TgO(3)/TgN).

The management of panic health and on-time evacuation prevents COVID-19 infection incidences in educational institutions and public places. Therefore, a system is required to predict the infection and suggests a safe evacuation path to people that control panic scenarios with mortality. In this paper, a fog-assisted cyber physical system is introduced to control panic attacks and COVID-19 infection risk in public places. The proposed model uses the concept of physical and cyber space. The physical space helps in real time data collection and transmission of the alert generation to the stakeholders. Cyberspace consists of two spaces, fog space, and cloud-space. The fog-space facilitates panic health and COVID-19 symptoms determination with alert generation for risk-affected areas. Cloud space monitors and predicts the person’s panic health and symptoms using the SARIMA model. Furthermore, it also identifies risk-prone regions in the affected place using Geographical Population Analysis. The performance evaluation acknowledges the efficiency related to panic health determination and prediction based on the SARIMA with risks mapping accuracy. The proposed system provides an efficient on time evacuation with priority from risk-affected places that protect people from attacks due to panic and infection caused by COVID-19.","Sood, Sandeep Kumar; Rawat, Keshav Singh",Comput Commun,121,24

To control pathogen contamination and reduce the risk of illness, a system is required that can quickly detect and monitor target pathogens. We developed a simple and reproducible strategy, termed three-way junction (3WJ)-induced transcription amplification, to detect target nucleic acids by rationally combining 3WJ-induced isothermal amplification with a light-up RNA aptamer. In principle, the presence of the target nucleic acid generates a large number of light-up RNA aptamers (Spinach aptamers) through strand displacement and transcription amplification for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting Spinach RNA aptamers specifically bind to fluorogens such as 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone and emit a highly enhanced fluorescence signal, which is clearly distinguished from the signal emitted in the absence of the target nucleic acid. With the proposed strategy, concentrations of target nucleic acids selected from the genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) were quantitatively determined with high selectivity. In addition, the practical applicability of the method was demonstrated by performing spike-and-recovery experiments with S. Typhi in human serum.","Kim, Jung Ho; Kim, Seokjoon; Hwang, Sung Hyun; Yoon, Tae Hwi; Park, Jung Soo; Lee, Eun Sung; Woo, Jisu; Park, Ki Soo",Sensors (Basel),121,5

NHS England has estimated that there are 7.2 million missed general practice appointments annually, at a cost of £216 million. Reducing these numbers is important for an efficient primary care sector. AIM: To evaluate the impact of a system-wide quality improvement (QI) programme on the rates of missed GP appointments, and to identify effective practice interventions. DESIGN AND SETTING: Practices within a clinical commissioning group (CCG) in East London, with an ethnically diverse and socially deprived population. METHOD: Study practices engaged in a generic QI programme, which included sharing data on appointment systems and Did Not Attend (DNA) rates. Fourteen out of 25 practices implemented DNA reduction projects, supported by practice-based coaching. Appointment data were collected from practice electronic health records. Evaluation included comparisons of DNA rates pre- and post-intervention using interrupted times series analysis. RESULTS: In total, 25 out of 32 practices engaged with the programme. The mean DNA rate at baseline was 7% (range 2–12%); 2 years later the generic intervention DNA rates were 5.2%. This equates to a reduction of 4030 missed appointments. The most effective practice intervention was to reduce the forward booking time to 1 day. The practice that made this change reduced its mean DNA rate from 7.8% to 3.9%. CONCLUSION: Forward booking time in days is the best predictor of practice DNA rates. Sharing appointment data produced a significant reduction in missed appointments, and behaviour change interventions with patients had a modest additional impact; in contrast, introducing structural change to the appointment system effectively reduced DNA rates. To reduce non-attendance, it appears that the appointment system needs to change, not the patient.","Margham, Tom; Williams, Crystal; Steadman, Jack; Hull, Sally",Br J Gen Pract,121,1

The origin of SARS-Cov-2 and its evolutionary relationship is still ambiguous. Several reports attempted to figure out this critical issue by genome-based phylogenetic analysis, yet limited progress was obtained, principally owing to the disability of these methods to reasonably integrate phylogenetic information from all genes of SARS-CoV-2. Supertree method based on multiple trees can produce the overall reasonable phylogenetic tree. However, the supertree method has been barely used for phylogenetic analysis of viruses. Here we applied the matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) pseudo-sequence supertree analysis to study the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with other phylogenetic analysis methods, the supertree method showed more resolution power for phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses. In particular, the MRP pseudo-sequence supertree analysis firmly disputes bat coronavirus RaTG13 be the last common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, which was implied by other phylogenetic tree analysis based on viral genome sequences. Furthermore, the discovery of evolution and mutation in SARS-CoV-2 was achieved by MRP pseudo-sequence supertree analysis. Taken together, the MRP pseudo-sequence supertree provided more information on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution inference relative to the normal phylogenetic tree based on full-length genomic sequences.","Li, Tingting; Liu, Dongxia; Yang, Yadi; Guo, Jiali; Feng, Yujie; Zhang, Xinmo; Cheng, Shilong; Feng, Jie",Sci Rep,121,6

METHODS: This was a population-based, retrospective study from 2013 to 2015. Specimens were analyzed by molecular methods. This analysis was performed using the database of Virology Unit, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital. Data from 1510 admitted patients with suspected respiratory viral infections was extracted. RESULTS: The database contained a total of 39 (2.6%) patients infected with PIV (53.8% male and 46.2% females) and 20 (51.3%) were under 1 year of age. The most frequently isolated type was type 3 (28, 71.8%) followed by type 1 (9, 23.1%).

Due to pre-analytical and technical limitations, samples with low viral load are often misdiagnosed as false-negative samples. Therefore, it is important to evaluate other strategies able to overcome the limits of RT-qPCR. Blinded swab samples from two individuals diagnosed positive and negative for COVID-19 were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-qPCR in order to assess the sensitivity of both methods. Intercalation chemistries and a World Health Organization (WHO)/Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved probe for the SARS-CoV-2 N gene were used. SYBR-Green RT-qPCR is not able to diagnose as positive samples with low viral load, while, TaqMan Probe RT-qPCR gave positive signals at very late Ct values. On the contrary, ddPCR showed higher sensitivity rate compared to RT-qPCR and both EvaGreen and probe ddPCR were able to recognize the sample with low viral load as positive even at 10-fold diluted concentration. In conclusion, ddPCR shows higher sensitivity and specificity compared to RT-qPCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in false-negative samples with low viral load. Therefore, ddPCR is strongly recommended in clinical practice for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the follow-up of positive patients until complete remission.","Falzone, Luca; Musso, Nicolò; Gattuso, Giuseppe; Bongiorno, Dafne; Palermo, Concetta Ilenia; Scalia, Guido; Libra, Massimo; Stefani, Stefania",Int J Mol Med,121,26

Currently, the optimization of guideline-directed chronic HF therapy remains the mainstay to further improve outcomes for patients with HFrEF to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization. This includes established device therapies, such as implantable defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapies, which improved patients' symptoms and prognosis. Over the last 10 years, new HF drugs have merged targeting various pathways, such as those that simultaneously suppress the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and the breakdown of endogenous natriuretic peptides (e.g., sacubitril/valsartan), and those that inhibit the I(f) channel and, thus, reduce heart rate (e.g., ivabradine). Furthermore, the treatment of patient comorbidities (e.g., iron deficiency) has shown to improve functional capacity and to reduce hospitalization rates, when added to standard therapy. More recently, other potential treatment mechanisms have been explored, such as the sodium/glucose co-transporter inhibitors, the guanylate cyclase stimulators and the cardiac myosin activators. In this review, we summarize the novel developments in HFrEF pharmacological and device therapy and discuss their implementation strategies into practice to further improve outcomes.","Abdin, Amr; Bauersachs, Johann; Frey, Norbert; Kindermann, Ingrid; Link, Andreas; Marx, Nikolaus; Lainscak, Mitja; Slawik, Jonathan; Werner, Christian; Wintrich, Jan; Böhm, Michael",Clin Res Cardiol,121,29

We sought to understand the infection prevention and control needs and challenges associated with caring for patients during the pandemic from the perspective of HHAs. METHODS: From June to August 2020, data were collected from HHAs in the New York metropolitan area using semi-structured qualitative interviews by telephone; 12 HHAs were interviewed in Spanish. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed, translated and analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: In total, 25 HHAs employed by 4 unique home care agencies participated. HHAs had a mean age of 49.8 (±9.1), 24 (97%) female, 11 (44%) Black, 12 (48%) Hispanic. Three major themes related to the experience of HHA's working during the COVID-19 pandemic emerged: (a) all alone, (b) limited access to information and resources, and (c) dilemmas related to enhanced COVID-19 precautions. Hispanic HHAs with limited English proficiency faced additional difficulties related to communication. CONCLUSION: We found that HHA communication with nursing staff, plays a key role in infection control efforts in home care. Efforts to manage COVID-19 in home care should include improving communication between HHAs and nursing staff.","Osakwe, Zainab Toteh; Osborne, Jennel C.; Samuel, Tonya; Bianco, Gabriella; Céspedes, Amarilis; Odlum, Michelle; Stefancic, Ana",Am J Infect Control,121,9

Capitalism and the longevity of national governments require continued investment and economic growth. This disrupts the environment, most urgently in terms of climate change, which is expected to single out the Mediterranean region for droughts and heat and to lead to mass migrations of people and animals. Capitalism also disrupts the habitats of fauna, and creates factory farming and markets for the sale of animals from local ecologies that are being “opened up” for profitable use—all of which leads to increased interaction between potential vectors of infectious diseases and humans. Capitalist globalization has encouraged widespread international and other travel of people and goods, which can carry infectious people or animal vectors across long distances very rapidly. In sum, capitalism requires development, which creates environmental and infectious disease crises. Solving this problem will require profound political and economic change. In the immediate term, public health and medical institutions need to be protected against the pressures of austerity.","Friedman, Samuel R.",EuroMediterr J Environ Integr,121,11

Unfortunately, a late cancer diagnosis has a detrimental effect in prognosis. We aimed to assess the staging of breast cancer (BC) and cervical cancer (CC) patients (pts) during their first consultation, comparing the periods during and prior to the pandemic. Methods: Data were collected from pts who started follow-up and treatment in a cancer center in Brazil from Sep/20-Jan/21 and from Sep/19-Jan/20. These periods were selected considering the beginning and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, which started on Feb/20 and is still ongoing. We considered the period (Sep/20-Jan/21) to be representative of the pandemic impact on cancer diagnosis. The primary endpoint was BC and CC stages at diagnosis. CC staging was defined according to 2018 FIGO staging. Clinical or pathological (for those with upfront surgery) BC stage was defined according to the TNM anatomic stage from AJCC 8th edition. The comparison of cancer stages between the two periods was performed using Chi-Square test. Results: 268 BC pts and 44 CC pts had their first consult from Sep/20-Jan/21;457 and 60, respectively, occurred from Sep/19-Jan/20. Pts who attended their first consult during the pandemic period presented with higher BC (P<0.001) and CC (P=0.328) stages than those prior to the pandemic, although the difference was not statistically significant for cervical cancer. The proportion of CC pts diagnosed with locally advanced disease (stages III-IVA) was 56.8% (N=25) in Sep/20-Jan/21 compared to 43.3% (N=26) in Sep/19-Jan/20. Similarly, 37.3% (N=100) of BC pts had stage III disease in Sep/20-Jan/21 compared to 23.2% (N=106) in Sep/19-Jan/20. Fewer pts were diagnosed with stage I BC during the pandemic (9.3% vs 20.6%). Additionally, fewer BC pts were diagnosed due to screening tests during the pandemic (13.7%;N=36) than before it (25.5%;N=113) (P<0.001). Conclusions: BC and CC pts presented with a higher stage in their first consultation at a cancer center during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a similar period prior to the pandemic, confirming the long-term negative impact of the pandemic for oncologic pts. Thus, efforts should be made not to compromise essential cancer services. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding. Disclosure: R.R.D.C.C.

Though some of the etiologies are hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and tobacco; certain types of chemotherapies play a major role. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has shown lifesaving results via drug-eluting stent (DES) deployment into occluded vessels. In this study, DES utilization among patients receiving chemotherapy will be assessed to observe if it provides any prevention against ACS. Articles were systematically screened in three databases such as PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) using keywords and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms for applicable articles.

Ten related studies were strictly reviewed. DES did not appear to play a preventable role against ACS during chemotherapy as no study was found assessing DES prophylactically and its efficacy in cancer patients. Future clinical trials on DES prophylactic use might be beneficial to evaluate if ACS adversities of chemotherapy can be prevented. This review is of significant benefit as cardiovascular adversities would not impede chemotherapy efficacy as cardiac adversities would not be part of the equation.","Hamdan, Jaafar A; Youssef, Kerolos N; Khan, Aafreen; Abdalla, Mohammed A; Zakhary, Christine M; Rushdi, Hiam; Khan, Safeera",Cureus,121,3

Operationalization of the One Health approach is still unclear for various local health systems with their respective targets. In this scenario, the empirical study of intersectoral collaboration between the human and animal health systems provides an opportunity to investigate the appropriate strategies and their enabling factors at the local health system level. Thus, this study documented and validated the innovative strategy for intersectoral collaboration, focusing on effectual prevention and control of zoonotic diseases with its enabling factors for a city in western India, Ahmedabad. METHODS: This case study was conducted in three phases: phase I (qualitative data collection, i.e., vignette interview), phase II (quantitative data collection through modified policy Delphi), and phase III (participatory workshop). The vignette data were handled for content analysis, and the Delphi data, like other quantitative data, for descriptive statistics. The participatory workshop adapts the computerized Sensitivity Model(®) developed by Vester to analyse the health system dynamics. RESULT: Out of the possible 36 strategies, this study validated the top 15 essential (must-have) and five preferred (should-have) strategies for the study area. For operationalization of the One Health approach, the enabling factors that were identified through the systems approach are micro-level factors at the individual level (trust, leadership, motivation, knowledge), meso-level factors at the organizational level (human resource, capacity-building, shared vision, decision-making capacity, laboratory capacity, surveillance), macro-level factors at the system level (coordinated roles, relationships, common platform), and external factors outside of the system (guidelines/policies, community participation, a specific budget, political will, smart technology). DISCUSSION: This study reveals that the micro-level factors at the individual level are potential levers of the health system. More attention to these factors could be beneficial for the operationalization of the One Health approach. This study recommends a systems approach through a bottom-up exploration to understand the local health system and its enabling factors, which should be accounted for in formulating future One Health policies.

At the same time, there were significant differences in terms of the impact of the second wave of the pandemic in Melbourne and Sydney. This qualitative study examines how these two major Jewish centers, where 84% of the Jews in Australia reside, responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It will discuss the policies that were put in place to assist those in need, with a range of different activities, including Jewish schools, going on-line, leading to many more opportunities to access news and participate in learning sessions. This study will highlight the similarities and differences between the two centers in terms of their organizational structures, which developed out of different historical migration patterns, and how these impacted on the current responses to the pandemic. The Sydney Jewish community has a centralized system of fundraising, planning and management in contrast to Melbourne, where the challenging situation created the need for better coordination. This was spearheaded by Jewish Care Victoria, which subsequently argued for a more permanent system of coordinated fundraising, planning and management for Melbourne Jewry. This article, which examines these developments, is based on oral interviews, written communications, community and media commentary, as well as historical material.

The Alu-fusion-mediated loss-of-function of CMAH fixed ∼2–3 Ma, possibly contributing to the origins of the genus Homo. The mutation likely altered human self-associated molecular patterns, triggering multiple events, including emergence of human-adapted pathogens with strong preference for Neu5Ac recognition and/or presenting Neu5Ac-containing molecular mimics of human glycans, which can suppress immune responses via CD33-related-Siglec engagement. Human-specific alterations reported in some gene-encoding Sia-sensing proteins suggested a “hotspot” in hominin evolution. The availability of more hominid genomes including those of two extinct hominins now allows full reanalysis and evolutionary timing. Functional changes occur in 8/13 members of the human genomic cluster encoding CD33-related Siglecs, all predating the human common ancestor. Comparisons with great ape genomes indicate that these changes are unique to hominins. We found no evidence for strong selection after the Human–Neanderthal/Denisovan common ancestor, and these extinct hominin genomes include almost all major changes found in humans, indicating that these changes in hominin sialobiology predate the Neanderthal–human divergence ∼0.6 Ma. Multiple changes in this genomic cluster may also explain human-specific expression of CD33rSiglecs in unexpected locations such as amnion, placental trophoblast, pancreatic islets, ovarian fibroblasts, microglia, Natural Killer(NK) cells, and epithelia. Taken together, our data suggest that innate immune interactions with pathogens markedly altered hominin Siglec biology between 0.6 and 2 Ma, potentially affecting human evolution.","Khan, Naazneen; de Manuel, Marc; Peyregne, Stephane; Do, Raymond; Prufer, Kay; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Varki, Nissi; Gagneux, Pascal; Varki, Ajit",Genome Biol Evol,121,11

Here we report the cloning and characterization of the cDNA and gene encoding porcine DC-SIGN (pDC-SIGN). The full-length pDC-SIGN cDNA encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 240 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pDC-SIGN, together with bovine, canis and equine DC-SIGN, are more closely related to mouse SIGNR7 and SIGNR8 than to human DC-SIGN. pDC-SIGN has the same gene structure as bovine, canis DC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR8 with eight exons. pDC-SIGN mRNA expression was detected in pig spleen, thymus, lymph node, lung, bone marrow and muscles. pDC-SIGN protein was found to express on the surface of monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, lymph node sinusoidal macrophage-like, dendritic-like and endothelial cells but not of monocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes or lymph node lymphocytes. A BHK cell line stably expressing pDC-SIGN binds to human ICAM-3 and ICAM-2 immunoadhesins in a calcium-dependent manner, and enhances the transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to target cells in trans.

We conducted daily transcriptomic profiling of three COVID-19 cases and found that the early immune response in COVID-19 patients is highly dynamic. Patient throat swabs were tested daily for SARS-CoV-2, with the virus persisting for 3 to 4 weeks in all three patients. Cytokine analyses of whole blood revealed increased cytokine expression in the single most severe case. However, most inflammatory gene expression peaked after respiratory function nadir, except expression in the IL1 pathway. Parallel analyses of CD4 and CD8 expression suggested that the pro-inflammatory response may be intertwined with T cell activation that could exacerbate disease or prolong the infection. Collectively, these findings hint at the possibility that IL1 and related pro-inflammatory pathways may be prognostic and serve as therapeutic targets for COVID-19. This work may also guide future studies to illuminate COVID-19 pathogenesis and develop host-directed therapies.","Ong, Eugenia Ziying; Chan, Yvonne Fu Zi; Leong, Wan Ying; Lee, Natalie Mei Ying; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Haja Mohideen, Salahudeen Mohamed; Chan, Kian Sing; Tan, Anthony Tanoto; Bertoletti, Antonio; Ooi, Eng Eong; Low, Jenny Guek Hong",Cell Host Microbe,121,1

However, large-scale studies of COVID-19 mortality and new-onset comorbidity compared to individuals tested negative for COVID-19 and individuals tested for influenza A/B are lacking. We investigated COVID-19 30-day mortality and new-onset comorbidity compared to individuals with negative COVID-19 test results and individuals tested for influenza A/B. Methods and findings: This population-based cohort study utilized electronic health records covering roughly half (n = 2,647,229) of Denmark's population, with nationwide linkage of microbiology test results and death records. All individuals ≥18 years tested for COVID-19 and individuals tested for influenza A/B were followed from 11/2017 to 06/2020. Main outcome was 30-day mortality after a test for either COVID-19 or influenza. Secondary outcomes were major comorbidity diagnoses 30-days after the test for either COVID-19 or influenza A/B. In total, 224,639 individuals were tested for COVID-19. To enhance comparability, we stratified the population for in- and outpatient status at the time of testing. Among inpatients positive for COVID-19, 356 of 1,657 (21%) died within 30 days, which was a 3.0 to 3.1-fold increased 30-day mortality rate, when compared to influenza and COVID-19-negative inpatients (all p < 0.001). For outpatients, 128 of 6,263 (2%) COVID-19-positive patients died within 30 days, which was a 5.5 to 6.9-fold increased mortality rate compared to individuals tested negative for COVID-19 or individuals tested positive or negative for influenza, respectively (all p < 0.001). Compared to hospitalized patients with influenza A/B, new-onset ischemic stroke, diabetes and nephropathy occurred more frequently in inpatients with COVID-19 (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: In this population-based study comparing COVID-19 positive with COVID-19 negative individuals and individuals tested for influenza, COVID-19 was associated with increased rates of major systemic and vascular comorbidity and substantially higher mortality. Results should be interpreted with caution because of differences in test strategies for COVID-19 and influenza, use of aggregated data, the limited 30-day follow-up and the possibility for changing mortality rates as the pandemic unfolds. However, the true COVID-19 mortality may even be higher than the stated 3.0 to 5.5-fold increase, owing to more extensive testing for COVID-19.","Nersesjan, Vardan; Amiri, Moshgan; Christensen, Hanne K.; Benros, Michael E.; Kondziella, Daniel",Front Med (Lausanne),121,16

METHODS: This was a retrospective, pre‐ and post‐implementation study using data from an adult, tertiary cardiology and neurosciences centre with 24‐hour capacity for endovascular procedures. All primary presentations with acute stroke or AMI during the first 28 days of Stage 2 and 3 SOE restrictions (26 March to 23 April 2020) were compared to an equivalent period without restrictions (26 March to 23 April 2019). The primary outcome variable was time from onset of symptoms to emergency department (ED) presentation. RESULTS: There were 52 (1.6% of all ED presentations) patients that met inclusion criteria during the SOE period and 57 (1.0%) patients in the comparator period. Patients were equally matched for demographics, disease severity and prior history of stroke or AMI. Median time from symptom onset to presentation was 227 (93‐1183) mins during the SOE period and 342 (119‐1220) mins during the comparator period (p=0.24). Among eligible patients with ischaemic stroke or ST‐elevation AMI, median time to primary reperfusion intervention was 65 (37‐78) mins during SOE and 44 (39‐60) mins in the comparator period (p=0.54). There were no differences in mortality at hospital discharge (9.6% vs 10.5%) and hospital LOS (5.4 vs 4.3 days). CONCLUSIONS: In the first 28 days, SOE measures to combat COVID‐19 were not associated with delays in presentation or life‐saving interventions for patients with acute stroke and AMI.

Live transport of fish is, therefore, a common procedure in aquaculture and is a potential animal welfare hazard. Little has been published on current fish transportation practices in China or the knowledge and attitudes of stakeholders in this industry. Our qualitative study aimed to obtain original information about live transport processes from a cross-section of aquaculture stakeholders in China by conducting individual interviews. Stakeholders were interviewed about their knowledge of live transport and their attitudes towards the welfare of fish. Self-described knowledge of live transport varied between participants with different job types. Most participants had heard of and understood the concept of “animal welfare”, but many understood it to only refer to terrestrial livestock, not fish. This suggests that knowledge of fish welfare in the industry may be less than for other farm animals. The findings of this pilot study contribute to a better understanding of live fish transport from a stakeholder point of view. The findings will also assist in informing, educating, and sensitizing stakeholders to the importance of fish welfare during live transport. ABSTRACT: China is the largest food fish producer in the world. Chinese consumers normally purchase fish that are still alive to ensure freshness. Therefore, the live transport of fish is important in China’s aquaculture, although it carries potential risks for animal welfare. This study investigated the attitudes and knowledge of stakeholders within Chinese aquaculture towards the live transport and welfare of fish. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 participants who were involved with the aquaculture industry in China. Most participants self-rated their transport-related knowledge as moderate and had some understanding of animal welfare, although this term was generally considered only relevant to terrestrial animals. Participants’ responses indicated that the live transport of fish occurs frequently in China, generally using sealed tanks, plastic bags, and foam boxes, in purpose-built vehicles. Seasonal changes, such as changes in ambient and water temperature, are considered to be important contributors to successful live transport, as well as sufficient oxygen supplies and stocking density. The use of anesthetics was not commonly reported, particularly in food fish, and fish capture is predominantly by conventional dipnets. The health status of transported fish is determined mostly by morphology (body injury, body or eye color, and fin condition), as well as vigor and swimming ability. Our results indicate that live transport poses a number of welfare risks to fish but that participants in the process associated welfare concerns more with terrestrial animals, not fish.","Yang, Yifei; Wang, Tingyun; Phillips, Clive J.

In this study, silver nanoparticles were successfully biosynthesized from the extracellular extract of endophytic bacterium Pantoea anthophila isolated from the stem of Waltheria indica for the first time. The synthesized nanoparticles showed a strong absorption band at 410 nm in the UV–Visible range. The dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analysis indicated that the average particle size was 16 nm at 5.30 mV. FTIR spectrum displayed the presence of various functional groups at 3423.65, 1633.71, 1022.27, 607.58 cm(−1) that stabilised the nanoparticle. X-ray diffraction peaks were conferred to 100, 200, 220 and 311 planes of a face centred cubic structure. TEM and SEM micrograph revealed the spherical-shaped, polycrystalline nature with the presence of elemental silver analysed by EDAX. Selected area electron diffraction also confirms the orientation of silver nanoparticles with X-ray diffraction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against 10 different human pathogenic bacteria and fungi showed a broad spectrum inhibition against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the bacterial pathogens, B. Subtilis exhibited low activity compared to other pathogens. C. albicans was greatly controlled than other fungal species.

ABEI-GC exhibited excellent ECL activity. On this basis, a label-free ECL immunosensor was developed for the sensitive detection of human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) by using ABEI-GC as the ECL nano-interface via a layer-by-layer assembly technique. ABEI-GC was first assembled onto an ITO electrode. Positively charged chitosan was then electrostatically adsorbed to the modified electrode. Finally, negatively charged antibody-coated gold nanoparticles were attached to the surface to form the ECL immunosensor. In the presence of hIgG, hIgG was captured by its antibody. In addition, an ECL signal was detected in the presence of H(2)O(2) when a double potential was applied. The ECL immunosensor for the determination of hIgG showed a linear range of 1.0×10(−13)–1.0×10(−8) g/mL with a detection limit of 5.0×10(−14) g/mL. This immunosensor has high sensitivity, wide linearity and good reproducibility. The superior sensitivity of the proposed ECL immunoassay mainly derives from the incorporation of ABEI-GC, which not only improves the ECL intensity, response speed, and stability, but also provides a large specific surface for high levels of protein loading. This work reveals that ABEI-GC is good nano-interface for the construction of ECL biosensors. Our strategy is promising for protein detection and may open up a new avenue for ultrasensitive label-free immunoassays.","Shu, Jiangnan; Shen, Wen; Cui, Hua",Sci China Chem,121,16

Potential risks include patient harm by the preliminary application of research that lacks sufficient peer review, infringements on intellectual property, and loss of “research novelty.” METHODS: A literature review of the current use of social media in dispersion of prepublication data was performed. Current submission guidelines for surgical conferences and journals were analyzed for data release embargos and social media use policies. RESULTS: Conference abstract guidelines mentioned data embargos half of the time and the use of social media less than one third of the time. Eighty percentage of journal instructions to authors contained guidelines on both. CONCLUSIONS: In nonsurgical fields, the appropriateness of the use of social media to release prepublication data is increasingly being discussed. Little guidance exists on how surgical conference attendees should use social media while at conferences. Given the potential for patient harm and negative impact on intellectual property and attribution, further discussion is warranted. INTRODUCCIÓN: Esta crítica investiga el uso de las redes sociales en las conferencias quirúrgicas y los efectos posibles de los datos pre-publicados en cirugía. Los riesgos probables incluyen: daño al paciente causado por la aplicación prematura de las investigaciones sin bastante análisis, violación de la propiedad intelectual, y perdido de “novedad de investigación.” METODOLOGÍA: Un repaso fue hecho sobre el rol de las redes sociales en la propagación de los datos pre-publicados. Las normas actuales para la entrega de las conferencias y los periódicos quirúrgicos claves fueron analizadas por las reglas gobernando el uso de las redes sociales y los embargos del lanzamiento de datos. RESULTADOS: Las reglas generales sobre la entrega de abstractos para las conferencias mencionaron los embargos de datos la mitad del tiempo mientras que estas mismas reglas mencionaron el uso de las redes sociales menos que un tercio el tiempo. 80% de las instrucciones de los periódicos dirigidas a los autores tuvieron las reglas generales sobre los dos: los embargos de datas y las redes sociales. CONCLUSIONES: En las especialidades non-quirúrgicas, la pertinencia del uso de las redes sociales para lanzar el dato pre-publicado es discutida con más frecuencia. No existen normas sobre cómo se usan las redes sociales durante las conferencias.

Telemedicine was seen as a pragmatic solution to provide follow‐up care. This study aimed to assess the efficiency and satisfaction of a telephone consultation in neuro‐urology. METHODS: During the pandemic, the scheduled medical visits were converted into telephone consultation. For each teleconsultation, the physician assessed the efficiency and the patient‐rated global satisfaction of the teleconsultation. The physician and the patient assessed whether this teleconsultation replaced a physical visit. RESULTS: About 358 neurologic patients were included in the study. The mean efficiency of the telephone consultation was 9.3/10 (±1.5). The mean global satisfaction was 9.0/10 (±1.3). The majority of the patients (52.4%) would prefer a physical consultation. 90.2% might convert some clinic visits to teleconsultations in the future. No agreement was found between the patient and the physician when they were asked if the teleconsultation replaced the physical consultation initially scheduled (weight kappa = 0.02; 95% confidence interval = [−0.06 to 0.11]). Cognitive impairment, difficulty to obtain relevant information, and lack of physical examination were unfavorable to the efficiency of the teleconsultation. Cognitive impairment, embarrassing nature of the teleconsultation, and preference for a physical consultation were unfavorable to satisfaction of the patient. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine in neuro‐urology was associated with a high satisfaction of the patients and was described as efficient by the physicians. Despite this, the majority of the patients reported a preference for physical consultation. The COVID‐19 pandemic might be an opportunity to refine our practices in neuro‐urology and to develop telemedicine.","Chesnel, Camille; Hentzen, Claire; Le Breton, Frédérique; Turmel, Nicolas; Tan, Eliane; Haddad, Rebecca; Amarenco, Gérard",Neurourol Urodyn,121,20

This study explores a specific phenotype of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation (COV-HI), and its associations with escalation of respiratory support and survival. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive inpatients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to University College London Hospitals and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals in the UK with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of community-acquired infection. Demographic data, laboratory tests, and clinical status were recorded from the day of admission until death or discharge, with a minimum follow-up time of 28 days. We defined COV-HI as a C-reactive protein concentration greater than 150 mg/L or doubling within 24 h from greater than 50 mg/L, or a ferritin concentration greater than 1500 μg/L. Respiratory support was categorised as oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation. Initial and repeated measures of hyperinflammation were evaluated in relation to the next-day risk of death or need for escalation of respiratory support (as a combined endpoint), using a multi-level logistic regression model. FINDINGS: We included 269 patients admitted to one of the study hospitals between March 1 and March 31, 2020, among whom 178 (66%) were eligible for escalation of respiratory support and 91 (34%) patients were not eligible. Of the whole cohort, 90 (33%) patients met the COV-HI criteria at admission. Despite having a younger median age and lower median Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, a higher proportion of patients with COV-HI on admission died during follow-up (36 [40%] of 90 patients) compared with the patients without COV-HI on admission (46 [26%] of 179). Among the 178 patients who were eligible for full respiratory support, 65 (37%) met the definition for COV-HI at admission, and 67 (74%) of the 90 patients whose respiratory care was escalated met the criteria by the day of escalation. Meeting the COV-HI criteria was significantly associated with the risk of next-day escalation of respiratory support or death (hazard ratio 2·24 [95% CI 1·62–2·87]) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity. INTERPRETATION: Associations between elevated inflammatory markers, escalation of respiratory support, and survival in people with COVID-19 indicate the existence of a high-risk inflammatory phenotype. COV-HI might be useful to stratify patient groups in trial design.

However, the AB is modulated when targets are emotional, and is evoked when a task-irrelevant, emotional critical distractor (CDI) replaces T1. Neither manipulation fully captures the interplay between bottom-up and top-down attention in the AB: Valenced targets intrinsically conflate top-down and bottom-up attention. The CDI approach cannot manipulate second target (T2) valence, which is critical because valenced T2s can “break through” the AB (in the target-manipulation approach). The present research resolves this methodological challenge by indirectly measuring whether a purely bottom-up CDI can modulate report of a subsequent T2. This novel approach adds a valenced CDI to the “classic,” two-target AB. Participants viewed RSVP streams containing a T1–CDI pair preceding a variable lag to T2. If the CDI’s valence is sufficient to survive the AB, it should modulate T2 performance, indirectly signaling bottom-up capture by an emotional stimulus. Contrary to this prediction, CDI valence only affected the AB when CDIs were also extremely visually conspicuous. Thus, emotional valence alone is insufficient to modulate the AB.","Santacroce, Lindsay A.; Carlos, Brandon J.; Petro, Nathan; Tamber-Rosenau, Benjamin J.",Atten Percept Psychophys,121,26

We are studying the effects of combined confinement and protection measures on the dynamics of the epidemic. We consider a constant proportion of asymptomatic people. We assume that symptomatic infected people may change their urban travel behavior due to the disease which causes them to travel less to places where they used to move and to stay at home more often. We present a sensitivity study with respect to the parameters. We show that the combination of the use of masks with almost complete release of confinement makes it possible to avoid the occurrence of a secondary peak of the epidemic. The model predicts that a total release of confinement can be successful for an epidemic of [Formula: see text] if on average a proportion of [Formula: see text] of the population wears masks of [Formula: see text] efficacy.

While the decision by some public health authorities to space the doses because of limiting supply has raised concerns about vaccine efficacy, data indicate that a single dose is up to 90% effective starting 14 days after its administration. We analyzed humoral and T cells responses three weeks after a single dose of this mRNA vaccine. Despite the proven efficacy of the vaccine at this time point, no neutralizing activity were elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals. However, we detected strong anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and Spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular responses dominated by the CD4+ T cell component. A single dose of this mRNA vaccine to individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 boosted all humoral and T cell responses measured, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Neutralizing responses were increased in both potency and breadth, with distinctive capacity to neutralize emerging variant strains. Our results highlight the importance of vaccinating uninfected and previously-infected individuals and shed new light into the potential role of Fc-mediated effector functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy. They also provide support to spacing the doses of two-vaccine regimens to vaccinate a larger pool of the population in the context of vaccine scarcity against SARS-CoV-2.","Tauzin, Alexandra; Nayrac, Manon; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Gong, Shang Yu; Gasser, Romain; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Brassard, Nathalie; Laumaea, Annemarie; Vézina, Dani; Prévost, Jérémie; Anand, Sai Priya; Bourassa, Catherine; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Medjahed, Halima; Goyette, Guillaume; Niessl, Julia; Tastet, Olivier; Gokool, Laurie; Morrisseau, Chantal; Arlotto, Pascale; Stamatatos, Leonidas; McGuire, Andrew T.; Larochelle, Catherine; Uchil, Pradeep; Lu, Maolin; Mothes, Walther; Serres, Gaston De; Moreira, Sandrine; Roger, Michel; Richard, Jonathan; Martel-Laferrière, Valérie; Duerr, Ralf; Tremblay, Cécile; Kaufmann, Daniel E.; Finzi, Andrés",bioRxiv,121,5

This study aims to conduct a multidimensional emotional assessment method of UGS from the perspective of spatial quality. Panoramic videos of 15 scenes in the West Lake Scenic Area were displayed to 34 participants. For each scene, 12 attributes regarding spatial quality were quantified, including perceived plant attributes, spatial structure attributes, and experiences of UGS. Then, the Self-Assessment-Manikin (SAM) scale and face recognition model were used to measure people’s valence-arousal emotion values. Among all the predictors, the percentages of water and plants were the most predictive indicators of emotional responses measured by SAM scale, while the interpretation rate of the model measured by face recognition was insufficiently high. Concerning gender differences, women experienced a significantly higher valence than men. Higher percentages of water and plants, larger sizes, approximate shape index, and lower canopy densities were often related to positive emotions. Hence, designers must consider all structural attributes of green spaces, as well as enrich visual perception and provide various activities while creating a UGS. In addition, we suggest combining both physiological and psychological methods to assess emotional responses in future studies. Because the face recognition model can provide objective measurement of emotional responses, and the self-report questionnaire is much easier to administer and can be used as a supplement.","Qiao, Lin; Zhuang, Jingwei; Zhang, Xuan; Su, Yang; Xia, Yiping",Int J Environ Res Public Health,121,29

METHODS: All rheumatology patients attending a large suburban health network were invited to participate in an anonymized online survey. The primary outcome of interest was SARS-COV-2 vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of respondents (n = 641) was 52.7 (15.1) years and 74.4% (n = 474) were female. Sixty-five percent were willing to have a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, while 34.4% were vaccine-hesitant (unwilling or undecided). On multivariate analysis, vaccine acceptance was associated with smoking (OR: 2.25 [95% CI: 1.22-4.15; p = .009]), history of malignancy (OR: 2.51 [95% CI: 1.19-5.26; p = .015]), influenza or pneumococcal vaccination in the preceding year (OR: 2.69 [95% CI: 1.78-4.05; p < .001]) and number of COVID-Safe measures practiced (OR: 1.54 [95% CI: 1.05-2.26; p = .027]). Vaccine acceptance correlated with positive beliefs regarding vaccine efficacy (r = 0.40; p < .001) and safety (r = 0.36; p < .001). Vaccine acceptance correlated negatively with concerns regarding side-effects (r = -0.30; p < .001) and vaccine-associated RMD flare (r = -0.21; p < .001). In vaccine-hesitant respondents, 39.2% were more likely to accept vaccination if given a choice of which vaccine they receive and 54.5% if their rheumatologist recommended it. Twenty-seven percent of patients on immunomodulators were willing to withhold medications while 42.1% were willing if advised by their rheumatologist. CONCLUSION: SARS-COV-2 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent amongst RMD patients and associated with concerns regarding vaccine safety, efficacy, side effects and RMD flare. Clinician recommendation, vaccine choice and communications targeting patient concerns could facilitate vaccine acceptance.Significance and Innovations Vaccine hesitancy is prevalent in RMD patientsVaccine acceptance is associated with beliefs regarding vaccine safety and efficacy and concerns regarding RMD flare and vaccine-associated side effectsVaccine choice and clinician recommendation have the potential to improve vaccine acceptance in patients who are hesitant.","Ko, Tina; Dendle, Claire; Woolley, Ian; Morand, Eric; Antony, Anna",Hum Vaccin Immunother,121,1

We characterise the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs. METHODS: We used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterised the role of RNAaemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression. FINDINGS: 23·0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1·4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAaemia 10 days after onset of symptoms, but took 16 days to reach maximum severity, and 33 days for symptoms to resolve. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6·72 [95% CI, 2·45 – 19·79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2·43 [95% CI, 1·07 – 5·38]), and EPCs (OR 2·81 [95% CI, 1·26 – 6·36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0·47 [95% CI, 0·20 – 0·67]). INTERPRETATION: dPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAaemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.","Ram-Mohan, Nikhil; Kim, David; Zudock, Elizabeth J; Hashemi, Marjan M; Tjandra, Kristel C; Rogers, Angela J; Blish, Catherine A; Nadeau, Kari C.; Newberry, Jennifer A; Quinn, James V; O’Hara, Ruth; Ashley, Euan; Nguyen, Hien; Jiang, Lingxia; Hung, Paul; Blomkalns, Andra L; Yang, Samuel",medRxiv,121,16

Principally a narrative review of ongoing activities across sectors was undertaken to improve antimicrobial use and address issues with vaccines including COVID-19. Point prevalence surveys have been successful in hospitals to identify areas for quality improvement programs, principally centering on antimicrobial stewardship programs. These include reducing prolonged antibiotic use to prevent surgical site infections. Multiple activities centering on education have been successful in reducing inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials in ambulatory care for essentially viral infections such as acute respiratory infections. It is imperative to develop new quality indicators for ambulatory care given current concerns, and instigate programs with clear public health messaging to reduce misinformation, essential for pandemics.

Different DC subsets have complementing functions during viral infections, some specialize in antigen presentation and cross-presentation and others in the production of cytokines with antiviral activity, such as type I interferons. In this review, we summarize the latest updates concerning the role of DCs in viral infections, with particular focus on the complex interplay between DC subsets and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite being initiated by a vast array of immune receptors, DC-mediated antiviral responses often converge towards the same endpoint, that is the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of an adaptive immune response. Nonetheless, the inherent migratory properties of DCs make them a double-edged sword and often viral recognition by DCs results in further viral dissemination. Here we illustrate these various aspects of the antiviral functions of DCs and also provide a brief overview of novel antiviral vaccination strategies based on DCs targeting.","Marongiu, Laura; Valache, Mihai; Facchini, Fabio A; Granucci, Francesca",Clin Sci (Lond),121,26

Here, we discuss how current processes hamper sustainable data collection to enable meaningful analysis and insights. Following the ‘Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resource’ (FHIR) implementation guide, we introduce an ontology‐based standard questionnaire to overcome these shortcomings and describe patient 'journeys' in coordination with the World Health Organization's recommendations. We identify steps in the clinical health data acquisition cycle and workflows that likely have the biggest impact in the data‐driven understanding of this virus. Specifically, we recommend detailed symptoms and medical history using the FHIR standards. We have taken the first steps towards this by making patient status mandatory in GISAID (‘Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data’), immediately resulting in a measurable increase in the fraction of cases with useful patient information. The main remaining limitation is the lack of controlled vocabulary or a medical ontology.","Bauer, Denis C.; Metke‐Jimenez, Alejandro; Maurer‐Stroh, Sebastian; Tiruvayipati, Suma; Wilson, Laurence O.

Studies in the initial phase of the pandemic demonstrated these patients tended to have a worse prognosis than patients without myocardial injury. We sought to evaluate the clinical impact of significant troponin elevation in COVID-19-positive patients, along with predictors of poor outcomes, over the span of the pandemic to date. METHODS: We analyzed COVID-19-positive patients who presented to the MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, DC, and Maryland) during the pandemic (March 1–June 30, 2020). We compared clinical course and outcomes based on the presence of troponin elevation and identified predictors of mortality. RESULTS: The cohort included 2716 COVID-19-positive admitted patients for whom troponin was drawn. Of these patients, 250 had troponin elevation (≥1.0 ng/mL). In the troponin-elevation arm, the minimum troponin level was 1.9 ± 8.82; maximum elevation was 10.23 ± 31.07. The cohort's mean age was 68.0 ± 15.0 years; 52.8% were men. Most (68.5%) COVID-19-positive patients with troponin elevation were African American. Patients with troponin elevation tended to be older, with more co-morbidities, and most required mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (48.4%) in COVID-19-positive patients with concomitant troponin elevation than without troponin elevation (12.2%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with troponin elevation are at higher risk for mechanical ventilation and mortality. Efforts should focus on early recognition, evaluation, and intensifying care of these patients.","Case, Brian C.; Yerasi, Charan; Forrestal, Brian J.; Shea, Corey; Rappaport, Hank; Medranda, Giorgio A.; Zhang, Cheng; Abramowitz, Jonathan; Satler, Lowell F.; Ben-Dor, Itsik; Hashim, Hayder; Rogers, Toby; Waksman, Ron",Cardiovasc Revasc Med,121,1

While the immunological mechanisms that underlie different clinical trajectories remain poorly defined, pathogen-specific antibodies often point to immunological mechanisms of protection. Here, we profiled SARS-CoV-2–specific humoral responses on a cohort of 22 hospitalized individuals. Despite inter-individual heterogeneity, distinct antibody signatures resolved individuals with different outcomes. While no differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels were observed, spike–specific humoral responses were enriched among convalescent individuals, whereas functional antibody responses to the nucleocapsid were elevated in deceased individuals. Furthermore, this enriched immunodominant S-specific antibody profile in convalescents was confirmed in a larger validation cohort. These results demonstrate that early antigen-specific and qualitative features of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, point to differences in disease trajectory, highlighting the potential importance of functional antigen-specific humoral immunity to guide patient care and vaccine development.","Atyeo, Caroline; Fischinger, Stephanie; Zohar, Tomer; Slein, Matthew D.; Burke, John; Loos, Carolin; McCulloch, Denise J.; Newman, Kira L.; Wolf, Caitlin; Yu, Jingyou; Shuey, Kiel; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake Marie; Caradonna, Tim; Schmidt, Aaron; Suscovich, Todd J.; Linde, Caitlyn; Cai, Yongfei; Barouch, Dan; Ryan, Edward T.; Charles, Richelle C.; Lauffenburger, Douglas; Chu, Helen; Alter, Galit",Immunity,121,20

Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral drug that is currently in clinical trials for use against COVID-19. However, the delivery of FAV is challenging because of its limited solubility, and its formulation is difficult with common organic solvents and water. To address these issues, four FAV ionic liquids (FAV-ILs) were synthesized as potent antiviral prodrugs and were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The aqueous solubility and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of the FAV-ILs were also evaluated. The FAV-ILs exhibited improved aqueous solubility by 78 to 125 orders of magnitude when compared with that of free FAV. Upon oral dosing in mice, the absolute bioavailability of the β-alanine ethyl ester FAV formulation was increased 1.9-fold compared with that of the control FAV formulation. The peak blood concentration, elimination half-life, and mean absorption time of FAV were also increased by 1.5-, 2.0-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with the control. Furthermore, the FAV in the FAV-ILs exhibited significantly different biodistribution compared with the control FAV formulation. Interestingly, drug accumulation in the lungs and liver was improved 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, compared with the control FAV formulation. These results indicate that the use of ILs exhibits potential as a simple, scalable strategy to improve the solubility and oral absorption of hydrophobic drugs, such as FAV.","Moshikur, Rahman Md; Ali, Md Korban; Wakabayashi, Rie; Moniruzzaman, Muhammad; Goto, Masahiro",Molecular pharmaceutics,121,20

Out of the 2375 HIV negative respondents, 680 reported PrEP use and were included in this analysis. Median age was 33 years (IQR: 28–40), 98% cisgender men, 56% white, 74% high education, and 68% middle/high income. Willingness to use HIVST was 79% and 32% received an HIV self-testing during social distancing period. The majority reported preference for PrEP/HIV self-testing home delivery instead of collecting at the service. PrEP teleconsultation was experienced by 21% and most reported feeling satisfied with the procedures. High acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation was reported by 70%. In ordinal logistic model, having higher education was associated with high aceptability of PrEP teleconsultation (aOR:1.62; 95%CI: 1.07–2.45).

This is not the first nor will it be the last time that a member of β‐coronaviruses (CoVs) is waging a full‐scale war against human health. Notwithstanding the fact that pneumonia is the primary symptom of the novel coronavirus (2019nCoV; designated as SARS‐CoV‐2), the emergence of severe disease mainly due to the injury of nonpulmonary organs at the shadow of coagulopathy leaves no choice, in some cases, rather than a dreadful death. Multiple casual factors such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, platelet and complement activation, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system derangement, and hypoxemia play a major role in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. Due to the undeniable role of coagulation dysfunction in the initiation of several complications, assessment of coagulation parameters and the platelet count would be beneficial in early diagnosis and also timely prediction of disease severity. Although low‐molecular‐weight heparin is considered as the first‐line of treatment in COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy, several possible therapeutic options have also been proposed for better management of the disease.

The purpose of this study was to determine the regional disparities and factors associated with TT vaccine coverage in women aged 15–49 years in Indonesia. Methods: The Indonesian Demographic Health Survey (IDHS) 2017 data was used in this study. A total of 36,028 women, aged 15–49 years were recruited using the two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. The questionnaire used was based on the DHS Questionnaire Phase 7. Chi-squared and binary logistic regression were used in this study as part of the analysis. Results: We found that the TT vaccine coverage was 75.32% and that the majority were spread across several provinces. The provinces of Bali and Nusa Tenggara, the richer respondents, living in a rural area, visiting the health facility, having health insurance, and those currently working were factors making it more likely that the women would receive the TT vaccine. The respondents aged 15–24 years with a primary education level and the respondents who were divorced were less likely to receive the TT vaccine. Conclusion: The coverage of the TT vaccine among women can be increased by considering the regional disparities in Indonesia and the socio-economic demographic details of the respondents. Strengthening the policies from the central government in the local governments can improve the screening process and vaccine delivery outcomes. In addition, the importance of giving the TT vaccine to women needs to be relayed through health education in collaboration between health workers and the public.","Arifin, Hidayat; Widiasih, Restuning; Pradipta, Rifky Octavia; Kurniawati, Yulia",F1000Res,121,26

From 2016 to 2018, 56 IBV strains were isolated and identified from clinical samples obtained from various chicken farms located in central China. The S1 sequencing of these strains revealed nucleotide and amino acid identities of 70.2 to 100% and 62.6 to 100%, respectively, compared with those of reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the genotypes of the isolates included GI-13 (4/91), GI-7 (TW-I), GI-24 (Mass), GI-19 (QX), and GI-18 (LDT3-A), with GI-19 (QX) being the predominant genotype. Meanwhile, GI-13 (4/91) was the second most dominant genotype in Henan Province, whereas it was GI-7 (TW-I) in Hunan and Hubei provinces. Recombination analysis of 3 variant strains showed that CK/CH/HeN/20160113 might be a recombination of LDT3-A- and QX-type strains and that CK/CH/HeN/20160316 might be a recombination of Italy-02-type strain and CK-CH-LJS08II. The predicted tertiary structure between CK/CH/HeN/20160113 and LDT3-A-type strain revealed that the novel 336 (L-P) and 455 (S-A) mutations changed the structure from an alpha helix to a random crimp. In addition, the 275 (Y-F) site reduced the length of the β-sheet, whereas the site 353 (A-T) extended the β-sheet. These findings suggested that GI-19 (QX) remains the predominant genotype in central China, and a locally determined complex genotype associated with variable clinical symptoms exists related to gene recombination and mutations.","Ji, Jun; Gao, Yuyun; Chen, Qinxi; Wu, Qianqian; Xu, Xin; Kan, Yunchao; Yao, Lunguang; Bi, Yingzuo; Xie, Qingmei",Poult Sci,121,1

METHOD: This study has a cross-sectional and descriptive design, and a total of 133 nursing NH and community-dwelling older adults were enrolled in the study. Turkish death anxiety scale (TDAS), life satisfaction scale (SLS) and depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21) were used for the assessment. RESULTS: The majority of the older adults had no or mild depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in spite of the prolonged confinements, and were slightly satisfied with their lives. However, depression, anxiety, stress and TDAS levels were higher in participants aged 80 years and older. Residents of NHs had higher TDAS, depression and anxiety levels and lower SLS levels than community-dwelling older adults. Participants who were meeting their children and/or grandchildren less than 2 h a week, were found to have significantly lower SLS and higher depression scores. The increase in depression and TDAS scores predicted a decrease in SLS scores in older adults. CONCLUSIONS: As NH resident older adults have higher psychological distress and decreased life satisfaction due to the social isolation caused by the prolonged confinements, NH staff should be regularly informed on both preventive measures and mental health consequences of the pandemic, and should be trained for basic therapeutic interventions. Older adults should be supported to use telecommunication technologies to contact their families and friends, and participate in safe and accessible person-centred activity programs.","Arpacioglu, Selim; Yalçin, Murat; Türkmenoglu, Fatih; Ünübol, Basak; Çelebi Çakiroglu, Oya",Psychogeriatrics,121,24

The objectives of this study were to describe the baseline characteristics and changes of biomarkers of these COVID-19 patients and identify predictive value of the above markers for patient death. Using patient death as the observational endpoints, clinical data of inpatients in a special ward for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China were retrospectively collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate prognostic value of baseline characteristics and laboratory data changes. This study included clinical data of 75 patients. Age, c-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 levels were independent predictors of patient death. Survivors were characterized as having declining neutrophil counts, d-dimer, N-terminal pronatriuretic peptide, troponin I (TnI) and c-reactive protein levels, while counts of lymphocyte gradually came back. Non-survivors were characterized with increasing white blood cell counts (WBC) and neutrophil counts. Changes of WBC, TnI and interleukin-6 were also independently associated with patient death. Older age, baseline CRP and IL-6 levels may be used as meaningful predictors to identify patients with poor prognosis. Changes of biomarkers should be closely monitored in the management of patients with COVID-19, while constantly increasing levels of WBC, TnI and interleukin-6 in the disease course also predict patient death.","Li, Tao; Wang, Xin; Zhuang, Xianghua; Wang, Hui; Li, Ai; Huang, Laigang; Zhang, Xingqian; Xue, Yan; Wei, Fengtao; Ma, Cheng’en",Intern Emerg Med,121,24

We present findings from a usability and user experience study conducted with 11 blind and visually impaired participants and a sighted caretaker. Participants sent live video feed of their field of view to the remote caretaker’s terminal from a smartphone camera attached to their chest. The caretaker used this video feed to guide them through indoor and outdoor navigation scenarios using a combination of haptic and voice-based communication. Haptic feedback was provided through vibrating actuators installed in the grip of a Smart Cane. Two haptic methods for directional guidance were tested: (1) two vibrating actuators to guide left and right movement and (2) a single vibrating actuator with differentiating vibration patterns for the same purpose. Users feedback was collected using a meCUE 2.0 standardized questionnaire, interviews, and group discussions. Participants’ perceptions toward the proposed navigation assistance system were positive. Blind participants preferred vibrational guidance with two actuators, while partially blind participants preferred the single actuator method. Familiarity with cane use and age were important factors in the choice of haptic methods by both blind and partially blind users. It was found that smartphone camera provided sufficient field of view for remote assistance; position and angle are nonetheless important considerations. Ultimately, more research is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. We also present an expanded evaluation model developed to carry out further research on assistive systems.","Chaudary, Babar; Pohjolainen, Sami; Aziz, Saima; Arhippainen, Leena; Pulli, Petri",Virtual Real,121,24

An increased PCT level of PCT in COVID-19 patients especially in severe cases would be assumed as bacterial coinfection. Could PCT level increase in SARS-CoV-2 infection without bacterial coinfection? Several SARS-CoV-2 proteins activate STAT3-dependent transcriptional pathways particularly in monocytes, that could lead to increased PCT production. STAT3α isoform causes increased ACE2 expression, resulting more SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and further production of PCT.","Lugito, Nata Pratama Hardjo",Curr Res Transl Med,121,29

This study is focused on assessing the preparedness of healthcare personnel and the effectiveness of an educational intervention to improve this preparedness in those dealing with the COVID-19 infection. A prospective, multicenter audit cycle was conducted on 400 healthcare professionals (271 junior doctors, 90 nurses, 39 non-clinical hospital workers) sampled through stratified random sampling. A questionnaire that was based on “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC's) checklist for healthcare personnel's preparedness for transport and arrival of patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19” was sent to the participants after which an informative document, framed on the information provided by World Health Organization (WHO), CDC, and local guidelines from the Government of Pakistan's website, was distributed through social media platforms. The questionnaire was repeated after 2 weeks to close the audit loop. Chi-Square test and paired sample t-test were used to test significance. In the pre-intervention portion of the study, it was found out that the doctors and nurses had higher knowledge scores compared to the non-clinical hospital staff (p ≤ 0.05). A statistically significant improvement was seen after the educational intervention was deployed (p ≤ 0.05). The study concludes that the non-clinical staff, being a vital part of the healthcare framework, need to be educated and effective approaches for official inclusion of relevant information need to be incorporated into clinical practice to limit the transmission of COVID-19.","Zafar, Nowera; Jamal, Zohaib; Mujeeb Khan, Muhammad",Front Public Health,121,27

Here, we present a new method for identifying adaptive evolution on short evolutionary time scales with densely-sampled populations. We apply this method to SARS-CoV-2 to perform a comprehensive analysis of adaptively-evolving regions of the genome. We find that spike S1 is a focal point of adaptive evolution, but also identify positively-selected mutations in other genes that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Protein-coding mutations in S1 are temporally-clustered and, in 2021, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence in S1 is more than 4 times greater than in the equivalent influenza HA1 subunit.","Kistler, Kathryn E.; Huddleston, John; Bedford, Trevor",bioRxiv,121,1

A series of department formulates and constant improvements were made, including elective operation cancellation, altered conventional outpatient service into online outpatient service, strict control of inter department consultation prevention and entering the department, improvements in operation and treatment processes, and strict ward management. As a result, 1 patient with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage and deep vein thrombosis of the right lower extremity died suddenly due to pulmonary embolism during anticoagulation treatment. Two patients with deep coma gave up treatment and died. No patient was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in hospital. One doctor had a low fever and cough in January, and CT showed a small nodule in the lower left lung. After 2 weeks isolation and oral anti-infective drugs, the chest nodule disappeared. One nurse was isolated as a close contact with infected parents. One nurse was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in a mild symptom. She was discharged after being cured in the infected department. In conclusion, measures like sufficient theoretical training and protection upgrading for medical staff, continuous improvement on the understanding of COVID-19 characteristics and transmission routes, formulation of strict department management system, monitoring of patients and their families, could effectively deal with the epidemic situation in the neurosurgery department.","Sheng, Liuqing; Chen, Yingchun; Li, Huanhuan; Wang, Zhizhong; Bie, Bizhou; You, Huichao; Ye, Jianfeng; Feng, Juanjuan; Zhang, Chun; Li, Jun",J Craniofac Surg,121,2

Clinical findings indicated that the suppression of innate antiviral immunity, especially the type I and III interferon (IFN) production, contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 evades antiviral immunity still needs further investigations. Here, we reported that the open reading frame 9b (ORF9b) protein encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome inhibits the activation of type I and III IFN response by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of type I and III IFNs by Sendai virus or the dsRNA mimic poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibits the activation of type I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK{varepsilon} rather than IRF3-5D, the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of type I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, the adaptor protein of endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, TBK1, and prevents TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impeding the phosphorylation and nuclear trans-localization of IRF3 activation. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitates the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity, thus, facilitate virus replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 impaired antiviral immunity and providing an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Han, Lulu; Zhuang, Meng-Wei; Zheng, Yi; Zhang, Jing; Nan, Mei-Ling; Wang, Pei-Hui; Gao, Chengjiang",bioRxiv,121,30

However, the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood and there is little information available on any aspect of antiviral immunity in bats. Massively parallel sequencing of the bat transcriptome provides the opportunity for rapid gene discovery. Although the genomes of one megabat and one microbat have now been sequenced to low coverage, no transcriptomic datasets have been reported from any bat species. In this study, we describe the immune transcriptome of the Australian flying fox, Pteropus alecto, providing an important resource for identification of genes involved in a range of activities including antiviral immunity. RESULTS: Towards understanding the adaptations that have allowed bats to coexist with viruses, we have de novo assembled transcriptome sequence from immune tissues and stimulated cells from P. alecto. We identified about 18,600 genes involved in a broad range of activities with the most highly expressed genes involved in cell growth and maintenance, enzyme activity, cellular components and metabolism and energy pathways. 3.5% of the bat transcribed genes corresponded to immune genes and a total of about 500 immune genes were identified, providing an overview of both innate and adaptive immunity. A small proportion of transcripts found no match with annotated sequences in any of the public databases and may represent bat-specific transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first reported bat transcriptome dataset and provides a survey of expressed bat genes that complement existing bat genomic data. In addition, these data provide insight into genes relevant to the antiviral responses of bats, and form a basis for examining the roles of these molecules in immune response to viral infection.","Papenfuss, Anthony T; Baker, Michelle L; Feng, Zhi-Ping; Tachedjian, Mary; Crameri, Gary; Cowled, Chris; Ng, Justin; Janardhana, Vijaya; Field, Hume E; Wang, Lin-Fa",BMC Genomics,121,1

Some aspects of this therapy are still unknown, including the optimal timing of administration. OBJECTIVE: This observational study aimed to compare the 90-day mortality in two cohorts of patients when the drug was administered within the first 10 days from onset of symptoms or after day 11. METHODS: Patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had received tocilizumab were divided into two groups according to when the medication was administered. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, clinical improvement on a 6-item scale by day 6, biomarker improvement by day 6, radiological image improvement by day 10 and SaO(2) quotient by day 6. The results in the two groups were compared. Additionally, adverse events relating to tocilizumab were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were analysed. Both groups were epidemiologically comparable. The results obtained in the primary efficacy variable of the study (90-day mortality) showed a statistically significant difference in the subgroups according to the time of administration of tocilizumab (18.6% vs 5.0%, p=0.048). There was clinical improvement in 24.1% of patients at 6 days, with similar behaviour in both subgroups. No statistically significant differences were found in the percentage of patients who achieved radiological improvement at 10 days or in the other inflammatory parameters, with the exception of significant reductions in lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. Administration of tocilizumab was not associated with relevant adverse events. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of data regarding the timing of administration of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A strategy involving tocilizumab administration after 10 days from onset of symptoms may decrease mortality. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this emerging hypothesis.","Moreno Diaz, Raquel; Amor García, Miguel Angel; Teigell Muñoz, Francisco Javier; Saldaña Perez, Leonardo Ernesto; Mateos Gonzalez, María; Melero Bermejo, Jose Antonio; López Hernández, Alberto; Reyes Marquez, Laura; De Guzman García-Monge, Maria Teresa; Perez Quero, Jose Luis; Homez Guzman, Marcela Patricia",Eur J Hosp Pharm,121,24

Mechanical ventilation (MV) maintains gas exchange in patients with ARDS but exposes lung cells to physical forces that exacerbate injury. Our data demonstrate that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a mechanosensor in lung epithelial cells and that activation of this pathway during MV impairs lung function. We found that mTORC1 is activated in lung epithelial cells following volutrauma and atelectrauma in mice and humanized in vitro models of the lung microenvironment. mTORC1 is also activated in lung tissue of mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. Deletion of Tsc2, a negative regulator of mTORC1, in epithelial cells impairs lung compliance during MV. Conversely, treatment with rapamycin at the time MV is initiated improves lung compliance without altering lung inflammation or barrier permeability. mTORC1 inhibition mitigates physiologic lung injury by preventing surfactant dysfunction during MV. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast to canonical mTORC1 activation under favorable growth conditions, activation of mTORC1 during MV exacerbates lung injury and inhibition of this pathway may be a novel therapeutic target to mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury during ARDS.","Lee, Hyunwook; Fei, Qinqin; Streicher, Adam; Zhang, Wenjuan; Isabelle, Colleen; Patel, Pragi; Lam, Hilaire C.; Arciniegas-Rubio, Antonio; Pinilla-Vera, Miguel; Amador-Munoz, Diana P.; Barragan-Bradford, Diana; Higuera-Moreno, Angelica; Putman, Rachel K.; Sholl, Lynette M.; Henske, Elizabeth P.; Bobba, Christopher M.; Higuita-Castro, Natalia; Shalosky, Emily M.; Hite, R.

BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to expand globally, healthcare systems have become more overwhelmed than ever before, placing a great psychological strain on frontline nurses. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, observational, quantitative study. METHODS: In total, 215 frontline nurses working at 12 hospitals across Jazan, Saudi Arabia, were recruited. Data were collected during August 2020 using a modified version of the severe acute respiratory syndrome team questionnaire. RESULTS: Roughly two-thirds (62.3%) of the participants reported moderate to high levels of nervousness and fear at work. Ethical and moral responsibility has been determined as the main motivator for frontline nurses to practice their profession, with 88% of them expressing a willingness to work even if the situation deteriorated further. However, 87% of the participants were extremely concerned about transmitting the disease to their family members. The most common coping strategy adopted by the nurses appeared to be adherence to strict protective measures (93.5%), followed by the acquisition of more knowledge about the disease (82.3%). CONCLUSION: Frontline nurses experience severe psychological stress, which is mainly caused by their fear of contracting the infection or passing it on to their family members. Thus, proper education, adherence to infection control protocols, effective social support system, and access to sufficient personal protective equipment will help nurses enhance their coping abilities.","Al Muharraq, Essa H.",SAGE Open Nurs,121,1

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 249 nursing students from 3 nursing colleges located in 3 Korean cities, with experience in hospital clinical practice. A questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions of Zika virus infection was developed through a literature review and was subjected to pilot testing and validation. RESULTS: The level of infection-control knowledge for Zika virus was 54.5 of 100 points, and that of practice was 4.5 of 5 points. The infection-prevention attitude score was 4.4 of 5 points, and the risk-perception score was 2.3 of 5 points. Significant differences emerged in infection-prevention attitude toward Zika virus based on Zika virus vaccination intention. Additionally, practice and risk-perception scores differed significantly based on gender and Zika virus vaccination intention.

To protect chickens against ILTV infection, chicken-embryo origin (CEO) and tissue-culture origin (TCO) vaccines have been used. However, the transmission of vaccine ILTV from vaccinated- to unvaccinated chickens can cause severe respiratory disease. Previously, host cell responses against virulent ILTV infections were determined by microarray analysis. In this study, a microarray analysis was performed to understand host-vaccine ILTV interactions at the host gene transcription level. RESULTS: The 44 K chicken oligo microarrays were used, and the results were compared to those found in virulent ILTV infection. Total RNAs extracted from vaccine ILTV infected chicken embryo lung cells at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days post infection (dpi), compared to 0 dpi, were subjected to microarray assay using the two color hybridization method. Data analysis using JMP Genomics 5.0 and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program showed that 213 differentially expressed genes could be grouped into a number of functional categories including tissue development, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement, and inflammatory responses. Moreover, 10 possible gene networks were created by the IPA program to show intermolecular connections. Interestingly, of 213 differentially expressed genes, BMP2, C8orf79, F10, and NPY were expressed distinctly in vaccine ILTV infection when compared to virulent ILTV infection.

A survey-questionnaire approach was used to collect the point of view of frontline employees that work in five-star hotels in a metropolitan city of Korea. Four independent variables that were extracted from valid theoretical backgrounds along with four demographic variables were used in the study. The regression analysis was conducted to test the hypotheses, which revealed that job stress directly affected the employees’ desires to leave their organization. It also showed that perceived supervisor support mitigates employee turnover, and there were significant correlations between turnover intention with the employees’ marital status and job position. Gender and years of service did not affect the employees’ thinking of quitting their job. Our findings help hotel entrepreneurs better understand how to deal with customer incivility and employee job stress, and better comprehend the factors that minimize employees’ negative behaviors for the organization.","Chung, Hyunah; Quan, Wei; Koo, Bonhak; Ariza-Montes, Antonio; Vega-Muñoz, Alejandro; Giorgi, Gabriele; Han, Heesup",Int J Environ Res Public Health,121,1

Treatment recommendations must consider this risk for elderly and vulnerable cancer patients. We re-analyzed trials in elderly glioblastoma (GBM) patients, incorporating COVID-19 risk, in order to provide a quantitative framework for comparing different radiation (RT) fractionation schedules on patient outcomes. METHODS: We extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) for 1,321 patients from Kaplan-Meier curves from five randomized trials on treatment of elderly GBM patients including available subanalyses based on MGMT methylation status. We simulated trial data with incorporation of COVID-19 associated mortality risk in several scenarios (low, medium, and high infection and mortality risks). Median overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated for each simulation replicate. RESULTS: Our simulations reveal how COVID-19-associated risks affect survival under different treatment regimens. Hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrated the best outcomes in low and medium risk scenarios. In frail elderly patients, shorter courses of RT are preferable. In patients with methylated MGMT receiving single modality treatment, TMZ-alone treatment approaches may be an option in settings with high COVID-19-associated risk. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of COVID-19-associated risk models into analysis of randomized trials can help guide clinical decisions during this pandemic. In elderly GBM patients, our results support prioritization of hypofractionated RT and highlight the utility of MGMT methylation status in decision-making in pandemic scenarios. Our quantitative framework can serve as a model for assessing COVID-19 risk associated with treatment across neuro-oncology.","Tabrizi, Shervin; Trippa, Lorenzo; Cagney, Daniel; Tanguturi, Shyam; Ventz, Steffen; Fell, Geoffrey; Wen, Patrick Y; Alexander, Brian M; Rahman, Rifaquat",Neuro Oncol,121,5

METHODS: The spatial distribution of morbidity, mortality and case fatality was mapped using hierarchical Bayesian smoothed indirectly standardised ratios. Indirectly standardised ratios were used to evaluate the association between deprivation and the outcome measures. We looked separately at morbidity and mortality in the 10 districts with the highest and 10 districts with the lowest share of Roma population. RESULTS: Compared with the national average, the relative incidence of cases was 30%–36% lower in the most deprived quintile but the relative mortality and case fatality were 27%–32% higher. Expressed as incidence ratios relative to the national average, the most deprived municipalities had a relative incidence ratio of 0.64 (CI: 0.62 to 0.65) and 0.70 (CI: 0.69 to 0.72) for males and females, respectively. The corresponding figures for mortality were 1.32 (CI: 1.20 to 1.44) for males and 1.27 (CI: 1.16 to 1.39) for females and for case fatality 1.27 (CI: 1.16 to 1.39) and 1.32 (CI: 1.20 to 1.44) for males and females, respectively. The excess death rate (per 100 000) increased with deprivation levels (least deprived: 114.12 (CI: 108.60 to 119.84) and most deprived: 158.07 (CI: 149.30 to 167.23)). The 10 districts where Roma formed the greatest share of the population had an excess mortality rate 17.46% higher than the average for the most deprived quintile. CONCLUSIONS: Those living in more deprived municipalities had a lower risk of being identified as a confirmed COVID-19 case but had a higher risk of death. An inverse association between trends in morbidity and mortality by socioeconomic conditions should be a cause for concern and points to the need for responses, including those involving vaccination, to pay particular attention to inequalities and their causes.","Oroszi, Beatrix; Juhász, Attila; Nagy, Csilla; Horváth, Judit Krisztina; McKee, Martin; Ádány, Róza",BMJ Glob Health,121,26

To combat loneliness and social isolation in nursing homes, this trial presents a study during which social networks of nursing home residents and elderly hospital patients were maintained through virtual encounters and robots, respectively. The observational trial included volunteers who were either residents of nursing homes or patients in a geriatric hospital. Each volunteer was asked to fill in a questionnaire containing three questions to measure loneliness. The questionnaire also documented whether video telephony via the robot, an alternative contact option (for example, a phone call), or no contact with relatives had taken place. The aim was to work out the general acceptance and the benefits of virtual encounters using robots for different roles (users, relatives, nursing staff, facilities). Seventy volunteers with three possible interventions (non-contact, virtual encounters by means of a robot, and any other contact) took part in this trial. The frequency of use of the robot increased steadily over the course of the study, and it was regularly used in all facilities during the weeks of visitor bans (n = 134 times). In the hospital, loneliness decreased significantly among patients for whom the robot was used to provide contact (F(1,25) = 7.783, p = 0.01). In the nursing homes, no demonstrable effect could be achieved in this way, although the subject feedback from the users was consistently positive.","Follmann, Andreas; Schollemann, Franziska; Arnolds, Andrea; Weismann, Pauline; Laurentius, Thea; Rossaint, Rolf; Czaplik, Michael",Int J Environ Res Public Health,121,11

Since ventilation is an important factor that influences airborne transmission, we proposed to study the impact of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) with a variable air volume (VAV) primary air system, on the dispersion of infectious aerosols, in a cardiac intensive care unit, using a transient simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based on the finite element method (FEM). We analyzed three scenarios that followed the dispersion of pathogen carrying expiratory droplets particles from coughing, from patients possibly infected with COVID-19, depending on the location of the patients in the intensive care unit. Our study provides the mechanism for spread of infectious aerosols, and possibly of COVID-19 infection, by air conditioning systems and also highlights important recommendations for disease control and optimization of ventilation in intensive care units, by increasing the use of outdoor air and the rate of air change, decreasing the recirculation of air and using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The CFD-FEM simulation approach that was applied in our study could also be extended to other targets, such as public transport, theaters, philharmonics and amphitheaters from educational units.","Anghel, Larisa; Popovici, Cătălin-George; Stătescu, Cristian; Sascău, Radu; Verdeș, Marina; Ciocan, Vasilică; Șerban, Ionela-Lăcrămioara; Mărănducă, Minela Aida; Hudișteanu, Sebastian-Valeriu; Țurcanu, Florin-Emilian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,121,1

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physician-delivered prevention messages affect knowledge and information-seeking behavior of Black and Latinx individuals and whether this differs according to the race/ethnicity of the physician and tailored content. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. (Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04371419; American Economic Association RCT Registry, AEARCTR-0005789) SETTING: United States, 13 May 2020 to 26 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 14 267 self-identified Black or Latinx adults recruited via Lucid survey platform. INTERVENTION: Participants viewed 3 video messages regarding COVID-19 that varied by physician race/ethnicity, acknowledgement of racism/inequality, and community perceptions of mask-wearing. MEASUREMENTS: Knowledge gaps (number of errors on 7 facts on COVID-19 symptoms and prevention) and information-seeking behavior (number of Web links demanded out of 10 proposed). RESULTS: 7174 Black (61.3%) and 4520 Latinx (38.7%) participants were included in the analysis. The intervention reduced the knowledge gap incidence from 0.085 to 0.065 (incidence rate ratio, [IRR], 0.737 [95% CI, 0.600 to 0.874]) but did not significantly change information-seeking incidence. For Black participants, messages from race/ethnic-concordant physicians increased information-seeking incidence from 0.329 (for discordant physicians) to 0.357 (IRR, 1.085 [CI, 1.026 to 1.145]). LIMITATIONS: Participants' behavior was not directly observed, outcomes were measured immediately postintervention in May 2020, and online recruitment may not be representative. CONCLUSION: Physician-delivered messages increased knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention methods for Black and Latinx respondents. The desire for additional information increased with race-concordant messages for Black but not Latinx respondents. Other tailoring of the content did not make a significant difference.

While novel mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination platforms provide robust protection in immunocompetent individuals, the immunogenicity in CID patients on immunosuppression is not well established. Therefore, determining the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the setting of immunosuppression is essential to risk-stratify CID patients with impaired protection and provide clinical guidance regarding medication management. METHODS: We conducted a prospective assessment of mRNA-based vaccine immunogenicity in 133 adults with CIDs and 53 immunocompetent controls. Blood from participants over 18 years of age was collected before initial immunization and 1-2 weeks after the second immunization. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) IgG(+) binding, neutralizing antibody titers, and circulating S-specific plasmablasts were quantified to assess the magnitude and quality of the humoral response following vaccination. RESULTS: Compared to immunocompetent controls, a three-fold reduction in anti-S IgG titers (P=0.009) and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (p<0.0001) were observed in CID patients. B cell depletion and glucocorticoids exerted the strongest effect with a 36- and 10-fold reduction in humoral responses, respectively (p<0.0001). Janus kinase inhibitors and antimetabolites, including methotrexate, also blunted antibody titers in multivariate regression analysis (P<0.0001, P=0.0023, respectively). Other targeted therapies, such as TNF inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, and integrin inhibitors, had only modest impacts on antibody formation and neutralization. CONCLUSIONS: CID patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies exhibit impaired SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immunity, with glucocorticoids and B cell depletion therapy more severely impeding optimal responses.","Deepak, Parakkal; Kim, Wooseob; Paley, Michael A.; Yang, Monica; Carvidi, Alexander B.; El-Qunni, Alia A.; Haile, Alem; Huang, Katherine; Kinnett, Baylee; Liebeskind, Mariel J.; Liu, Zhuoming; McMorrow, Lily E.; Paez, Diana; Perantie, Dana C.; Schriefer, Rebecca E.; Sides, Shannon E.; Thapa, Mahima; Gergely, Maté; Abushamma, Suha; Klebert, Michael; Mitchell, Lynne; Nix, Darren; Graf, Jonathan; Taylor, Kimberly E.; Chahin, Salim; Ciorba, Matthew A.; Katz, Patricia; Matloubian, Mehrdad; O’Halloran, Jane A.; Presti, Rachel M.; Wu, Gregory F.; Whelan, Sean P.J.; Buchser, William J.; Gensler, Lianne S.; Nakamura, Mary C.; Ellebedy, Ali H.; Kim, Alfred H.J.",medRxiv,121,10

METHODS: To simulate a human source, an aerosol generating system was made using a bacterial suspension in a nebulizer attached to an oxygen cylinder. A fan connected to the nebulizer created aerosols. Transmitted aerosols were detected using blood agar plates at 0.1524 and 1.8288 meters from source, simulating exposed person. The study was performed under controlled conditions at room temperature in a biohazard hood with HEPA filter and UV light. RESULTS: When face shields were used alone, significant numbers of bacterial colonies grew on blood agar plates. When a mask used alone for both the subjects (source and exposed), the blood agar yielded minimal colony forming units (CFUs) at both distances. When face shields were used in combination with masks, no significant improvement was observed as compared to masks alone. DISCUSSION: Our results were similar to what have been observed in related studies. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical masks alone provided good protection, surpassing the protection provided by face shields alone. Both used together provided the best protection, although the combined protection was similar to surgical masks use alone.","Salimnia, Hossein; Meyer, Monica P.; Mitchell, Robert; Fairfax, Marilynn R.; Gundel, Angela; Guru, Navneet; Chopra, Teena",Am J Infect Control,121,24

Telehealth is an effective option to fight the outbreak of COVID-19. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the role of telehealth services in preventing, diagnosing, treating, and controlling diseases during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted through searching five databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria included studies clearly defining any use of telehealth services in all aspects of health care during COVID-19 outbreak, published from December 31, 2019, written in English language and published in peer reviewed journals. Two reviewers independently assessed search results, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the included studies. Quality assessment was based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist. Narrative synthesis was undertaken to summarize and report the findings. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion out of the 142 search results. Currently, healthcare providers and patients who are self-isolating, telehealth is certainly appropriate in minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This solution has the potential to prevent any sort of direct physical contact, provide continuous care to the community, and finally reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 outbreak.

Previously we reported our hypothesis that the antiviral drugs with high lung distributions might benefit COVID-19 patients by reducing viral loads. So far, chloroquine, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, ribavirin, darunavir, remdesivir, and umifenovir have been tested in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here we validated our hypothesis by comparing the pharmacokinetics profiles of these drugs and their capabilities of reducing viral load in clinical trials. According to bulk RNA and single cell RNA sequencing analysis, we found that high expression of both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) makes the lung and intestine vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and favipiravir, which were highly distributed to the lung, were reported to reduce viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, drugs with poor lung distributions, including lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir and remdesivir, were insufficient to inhibit viral replication. Lopinavir/ritonavir might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract according to their distribution profiles. We concluded here that the antiviral drugs should be distributed straight to the lung tissue for reducing viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, to better evaluate antiviral effects of drugs that target the intestine, the stool samples should also be collected for viral RNA test in the future.","Wang, Yan; Chen, Lei",Eur J Pharmacol,121,1

Reaction efficiencies for the M. cynos tuf gene assay on 2 platforms were based on amplification of standard curves spanning 8 orders of magnitude: ABI 7500 platform, 94.3–97.9% (r(2) ≥ 0.9935); QuantStudio OpenArray platform, 119.1–122.5% (r(2) = 0.9784).

Diagnostic performance was estimated by comparison with an in-house legacy assay on clinical specimens as well as testing isolates that were characterized previously by intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequencing. Exclusivity was established by testing 12 other Mycoplasma species. To substantiate the high specificity of the M. cynos tuf gene assay, sequence confirmation was performed on ISR PCR amplicons obtained from clinical specimens.

STUDY DESIGN: We used data on adolescents aged 15-19 from the 2006-2010 (n=4,662), 2011-2015 (n=4,134), and 2015-2019 (n=3,182) National Surveys of Family Growth. We used logistic regression to identify changes between periods in sexual behaviors and contraceptive use by gender, and for some measures by age. We estimated probabilities of age at first penile-vaginal intercourse with Kaplan-Meier failure analysis. RESULTS: Over half of adolescents have engaged in at least one of the sexual behaviors measured. Males reported declines in sexual behaviors with a partner of a different sex. Adolescent males reported delays in the timing of first penile-vaginal intercourse. Adolescent females reported increases from 2006-2010 to 2015-2019 in use at last intercourse of any contraceptive method (86%, 95%CI 83-89; 91%, 95%CI 88-94), multiple methods (26%, 95%CI 22-31; 36%, 95%CI 30-43), and IUDs or implants (3%, 95%CI 1-4; 15%, 95%CI 11-20). Adolescent males reported increases in partners' use of IUDs or implants use from <1% to 5% and recent declines in condom use at last intercourse (78%, 95%CI 75-82, 2011-2015; 72%, 95%CI 67-77, 2015-2019). Condom consistency declined over time. Males were more likely than females to report condom use at last intercourse and consistent condom use in the last 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify declines in male adolescent sexual experience, increased contraceptive use overall, and declines in consistent condom use from 2006 to 2019. IMPLICATIONS: This analysis contributes a timely update on adolescent sexual behavior trends and contraceptive use, showing that adolescent behaviors are complex and evolving. Sexual health information and services must be available so that young people have the resources to make healthy and responsible choices for themselves and their partners.","Lindberg, Laura D.; Firestein, Lauren; Beavin, Cynthia",Contracept X,121,24

The common clinical manifestations were similar across countries: fever (64%), cough (39%), and coryza (23%). Approximately 40% of children were asymptomatic, and overall mortality was 2.3%, with all deaths reported from India and Pakistan. Using the multivariable model, the infant age group, presence of comorbidities, and cough on presentation were associated with severe/critical COVID-19. This epidemiological study of pediatric COVID-19 infection demonstrated similar clinical presentations of COVID-19 in children across Asia. Risk factors for severe disease in children were age younger than 12 months, presence of comorbidities, and cough at presentation. Further studies are needed to determine whether differences in mortality are the result of genetic factors, cultural practices, or environmental exposures.","Wong, Judith Ju Ming; Abbas, Qalab; Chuah, Soo Lin; Malisie, Ririe Fachrina; Pon, Kah Min; Katsuta, Tomohiro; Dang, Hongxing; Lee, Pei Chuen; Jayashree, Muralidharan; Sultana, Rehena; Maha, Quratulain; Gan, Chin Seng; Shimizu, Naoki; Xu, Feng; Tang, Swee Fong; Shi, Luming; Lee, Jan Hau; Thoon, Koh Cheng; Yung, Chee Fu",Am J Trop Med Hyg,121,8

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R(0) of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R(0) was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R(0) of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R(0) of 2·5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R(0) of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R(0) was 1·5. For R(0) values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

Therefore, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) aimed to analyze the situation in different countries and systematically collect all information available regarding tolerability and possible amendments in daily practice of sublingual AIT (SLIT), subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) for inhalant allergies and venom AIT. METHOD: Under the framework of the EAACI, a panel of experts in the field of AIT coordinated by the Immunotherapy Interest Group (IT IG) set‐up a web‐based retrospective survey (SurveyMonkey®) including 27 standardized questions on practical and safety aspects on AIT in worldwide clinical routine. RESULTS: 417 respondents providing AIT to their patients in daily routine answered the survey. For patients (without any current symptoms to suspect COVID‐19), 60% of the respondents informed of not having initiated SCIT (40% venom AIT, 35% SLIT) whereas for the maintenance phase of AIT, SCIT was performed by 75% of the respondents (74% venom AIT, 89% SLIT). No tolerability concern arises from this preliminary analysis. 16 physicians reported having performed AIT despite (early) symptoms of COVID‐19 and/or a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). CONCLUSIONS: This first international retrospective survey in atopic diseases investigated practical aspects and tolerability of AIT during the COVID‐19 pandemic and gave no concerns regarding reduced tolerability under real‐life circumstances. However, the data indicate an undertreatment of AIT, which may be temporary, but could have a long‐lasting negative impact on the clinical care of allergic patients.","Pfaar, Oliver; Agache, Ioana; Bonini, Matteo; Brough, Helen Annaruth; Chivato, Tomás; Del Giacco, Stefano R.; Gawlik, Radoslaw; Gelincik, Aslı; Hoffmann‐Sommergruber, Karin; Jutel, Marek; Klimek, Ludger; Knol, Edward F.; Lauerma, Antti; Ollert, Markus; O’Mahony, Liam; Mortz, Charlotte G.; Palomares, Oscar; Riggioni, Carmen; Schwarze, Jürgen; Skypala, Isabel; Torres, María José; Untersmayr, Eva; Walusiak‐Skorupa, Jolanta; Chaker, Adam; Giovannini, Mattia; Heffler, Enrico; Jensen‐Jarolim, Erika; Quecchia, Cristina; Sandoval‐Ruballos, Mónica; Sahiner, Umit; Tomić Spirić, Vesna; Alvaro‐Lozano, Montserrat",Allergy,121,18

Despite being one of the most unequal regions of the world, there is a scarce report of the effect of socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 mortality in their countries. We aimed to identify the effect of some socioeconomic inequality-related factors on COVID-19 mortality in Colombia. METHODS: We conducted a survival analysis in a nation-wide retrospective cohort study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia from 2 March 2020 to 26 October 2020. We calculated the time to death or recovery for each confirmed case in the cohort. We used an extended multivariable time-dependent Cox regression model to estimate the HR by age groups, sex, ethnicity, type of health insurance, area of residence and socioeconomic strata. RESULTS: There were 1 033 218 confirmed cases and 30 565 deaths for COVID-19 in Colombia between 2 March and 26 October. The risk of dying for COVID-19 among confirmed cases was higher in males (HR 1.68 95% CI 1.64 to 1.72), in people older than 60 years (HR 296.58 95% CI 199.22 to 441.51), in indigenous people (HR 1.20 95% CI 1.08 to 1.33), in people with subsidised health insurance regime (HR 1.89 95% CI 1.83 to 1.96) and in people living in the very low socioeconomic strata (HR 1.44 95% CI 1.24 to 1.68).

The China-Gates Foundation Tuberculosis (TB) Control Program implemented online training for TB health workers in three provinces of China. We aim to evaluate the implementation of E-learning CME programs, analyse the barriers and facilitators during the implementation process, and to provide policy recommendations. METHODS: Routine monitoring data were collected through the project office from December 2017 to June 2019. In-depth interviews, focus group discussion with project management personnel, teachers, and trainees (n = 78), and staff survey (baseline n = 555, final n = 757) were conducted in selected pilot areas at the provincial, municipal, and county/district levels in the three project provinces (Zhejiang, Jilin, and Ningxia). Descriptive analysis of quantitative data summarized the participation, registration, and certification rates for training activities. Thematic approach was used for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: By the end of June 2019, the national and provincial remote training platforms had organized 98 synchronous learning activities, with an average of 173.2 people [standard deviation (SD) = 49.8] per online training session, 163.3 people (SD = 41.2) per online case discussion. In the pilot area, 64.5% of TB health workforce registered the asynchronous learning platform, and 50.1% obtained their professional certifications. Participants agreed that E-learning CME was more economical, has better content as well as more flexible work schedules. However, the project still faced challenges in terms of unmet learning needs, disorganized governance, insufficient hardware and software, unsupported environment, and lack of incentive mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that it’s feasible to conduct large scale E-learning CME activities in the three project provinces of China. Training content and format are key facilitators of the program implementation, while the matching of training supply and demand, organizational coordination, internet technology, motivations, and sustainability are key barriers.

Beyond the issues that are faced for any policy, evaluation of COVID-19 policies is complicated by additional challenges related to infectious disease dynamics and a multiplicity of interventions. The methods needed for policy-level impact evaluation are not often used or taught in epidemiology, and differ in important ways that may not be obvious. Methodological complications of policy evaluations can make it difficult for decision-makers and researchers to synthesize and evaluate strength of evidence in COVID-19 health policy papers. We (1) introduce the basic suite of policy impact evaluation designs for observational data, including cross-sectional analyses, pre/post, interrupted time-series, and difference-in-differences analysis, (2) demonstrate key ways in which the requirements and assumptions underlying these designs are often violated in the context of COVID-19, and (3) provide decision-makers and reviewers a conceptual and graphical guide to identifying these key violations.

Most recently CoVID-19 has killed about half million people (27th of June, 2020). Susceptibility to this disease appears to differ markedly across different societies but the factors underlying this variability are not known. Given that prevalence of toxoplasmosis in human societies may serve as a proxy for hygiene, and it also exerts both direct and immune-mediated antiviral effects, we hypothesize a negative covariation between toxoplasmosis and measures of the CoVID-19 pandemic across countries. We obtained aged-adjusted toxoplasmosis prevalence of pregnant women from the literature. Since the differences in the CoVID-19 morbidity and mortality may depend on the different timing of the epidemics in each country, we applied the date of first documented CoVID-19 in each country as a proxy of susceptibility, with a statistical control for population size effects. Using these two indices, we show a highly significant negative co-variation between the two pandemics across 86 countries. Then, considering that the wealth of nations often co-varies with the prevalence of diseases, we introduced GDP per capita into our model. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis co-varies negatively, while the date of first CoVID-19 co-varies positively with GDP per capita across countries. Further, to control for the strong spatial autocorrelation among countries, we carried out a Spatial Structure Analyses of the relationships between the date of first CoVID-19, prevalence of toxoplasmosis, and GDP per capita. Results of this analysis did not confirm a direct causal relationship between toxoplasmosis and susceptibility to the CoVID-19 pandemics. As far as an analysis of observational data let us to suggest, it appears that the interaction between CoVID-19 and toxoplasmosis is mediated by GDP per capita and spatial effects. This prompts the question whether the formerly known covariations of CoVID-19 and BCG vaccination or air pollution might have also emerged as spurious indirect effects.","Jankowiak, Łukasz; Rozsa, Lajos; Tryjanowski, Piotr; Møller, Anders Pape",Sci Rep,121,18

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on healthcare delivery. Here we describe the effect of repurposing of a research Computed Tomography scanner on clinical care of cardiology patients in an urban academic medical centre which did not have routine access to CCTA prior to the pandemic. Patients requiring invasive coronary angiography require transfer to a regional cardiac centre (no ICA available on site). PURPOSE: We investigated the effect of CCTA on i) diagnostic certainty ii) avoidance of clinician defined unnecessary invasive angiography in hospitalised patients. METHODS: This was a prospective, longitudinal cohort study involving hospitalized patients admitted to an urban academic medical centre (catchment population 650 000) between March 29 and September 21, 2020. Routinely collected (usual care) data were gathered by clinicians who were members of the usual care medical team and ethics approval or explicit patient consent was not required. High-sensitivity Troponin-I was measured on admission and 3- and 6– hours after if mandated (Abbott Architect TnI assay). A 320-detector scanner (Aquilon ONE, Canon) was used. Intravenous metoprolol was used where required to control the heart rate (target 60 b.p.m.) and sublingual glyceryl trinitrate will be given to all patients immediately before the scan acquisition. RESULTS: Forty-three patients underwent inpatient CCTA, mean age: 61 ± 13 years (range 30-88y), 54% female. The presenting complaint was typical chest pain in 28 (65%), atypical chest pain in 10 (23%), and a variety of symptoms in 5 (12%) including palpitations, syncope, breathlessness. Thirty-six (84%) of patients had a detectable TnI above the 99% centile. Median(IQR) peak TnI was 127 (33-635)ng/L. CCTA was carried out on average 1 day post request. CCTA resulted in an improvement in clinician diagnostic certainty (Initial review: 21% yes, 79% probable, post-CCTA review: 84% yes, 16% probable) in providing a diagnosis. 21 (49%) of invasive coronary angiograms were avoided due to CCTA, whilst an inpatient invasive coronary angiogram (ICA) was performed in 4(9%) due to CCTA demonstrating significant disease, and in 2(%) the ICA was changed from out-patient to in-patient. Three ICA tests were requested as OP due to CCTA findings. CCTA did not overestimate disease severity in this cohort. We saved 21 inter hospital transfers for ICA during this time period. Using NHS England cost tariffs, a cost saving of >£36,000 was made for using CCTA instead of ICA in these 21 patients who would have required ICA. CONCLUSION: Inpatient CCTA resulted in greater clinician diagnostic confidence, avoidance of unnecessary invasive angiograms and a significant cost saving. This also reduced the duration of patient stay, reducing the potential exposure of patients to COVID-19.","Mangion, K; Dewantoro, D; Mclennan, E; Tynan, N; Dymock, L; Woodward, R; Hopkins, T; Berry, C; Adams, J; Stobo, D; Roditi, GH; Byrne, J",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,121,1

The percentages of staff wearing personal protective equipment were 90%, 50%, 20% and 75% for masks, eye protection, gowns and gloves, respectively. Compliance ranking scored doctors as high, trainees as moderate and nursing staff as low. Overall contamination rate was 16.9 × 10(−2) events/person-min. The two leading systems sources for contamination were lack of specific task assignments among rescuers (44%) and inadequate preparation for procedures (42%). CONCLUSIONS: Among healthcare workers in the emergency setting, the study disclosed suboptimal compliance with basic infection control measures, including use of personal protective equipment and avoiding contamination.

The sheer volume of news produced daily necessitates the development of automated methods for separating fact from fiction. To tackle this issue, the computer science community has produced a plethora of approaches, documented in a number of surveys. However, these surveys primarily rely on one-dimensional solutions, i.e., deception detection approaches that focus on a specific aspect of misinformation, such as a particular topic, language, or source. Misinformation is considered a major obstacle for situational awareness, including cyber, both from a company and a societal point of view. This paper explores the evolving field of misinformation detection and analytics on information published in news articles, with an emphasis on methodologies that handle multiple dimensions of the fake news detection conundrum. We analyze and compare existing research on cross-dimensional methodologies. Our evaluation process is based on a set of criteria, including a predefined set of performance metrics, data pre-processing features, and domains of implementation. Furthermore, we assess the adaptability of each methodology in detecting misinformation in real-world news and thoroughly analyze our findings. Specifically, survey insights demonstrate that when a detection approach focuses on several dimensions (e.g., languages and topics, languages and sources, etc.), its performance improves, and it becomes more flexible in detecting false information across different contexts. Finally, we propose a set of research directions that could aid in furthering the development of more advanced and accurate models in this field.","Xarhoulacos, Constantinos-Giovanni; Anagnostopoulou, Argiro; Stergiopoulos, George; Gritzalis, Dimitris",Sensors (Basel),121,16

The Dectin-1 ligands zymosan, glucan phosphate and the anti-Dectin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 had no effect on influenza virus induced IFNα/β production by murine splenic pDC. However, mannan, a broad blocking reagent against mannose specific receptors, inhibited IFNα/β production by pDC in response to inactivated influenza virus. Moreover, viral glycoproteins (influenza virus haemagglutinin and HIV-1 gp120) stimulated IFNα/β production by splenocytes in a mannan-inhibitable manner, implicating the function of a lectin in glycoprotein induced IFN production. Lastly, the effect of CD200 on IFN induction was investigated. CD200 knock-out macrophages produced more IFNα than wild-type macrophages in response to polyI:C, a MyD88-independent stimulus, consistent with CD200's known inhibitory effect on myeloid cells. In contrast, blocking CD200 with an anti-CD200 mAb resulted in reduced IFNα production by pDC-containing splenocytes in response to CpG and influenza virus (MyD88-dependent stimuli). This suggests there could be a differential effect of CD200 on MyD88 dependent and independent IFN induction pathways in pDC and macrophages. This study supports the hypothesis that a mannan-inhibitable lectin and CD200 are involved in virally induced type I IFN induction.","Seeds, Rosalind E.; Mukhopadhyay, Subhankar; Jones, Ian M.; Gordon, Siamon; Miller, Joanna L.",Int Immunopharmacol,121,1

The viral envelope (E) protein, the principal surface protein of viral particles, plays a vital role in viral entry and fusion. In this study, two peptides derived from domain II (DII) and the stem of the TMUV envelope protein, TP1 and TP2, respectively, were tested for their antiviral activity. TP1 and TP2 inhibited TMUV infection in BHK-21 cells, and their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 14.19 mg/L and 7.64 mg/L, respectively. Viral inhibition assays in different cell lines of avian origin showed that the inhibitory effects of TP1 and TP2 are not cell type dependent. Moreover, TP2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. The two peptides inhibited antibody-mediated TMUV infection of duck peripheral blood lymphocytes. Co-immunoprecipitation assays and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) indicated that both peptides interact with the surface of the TMUV virion.

Based on the interim guidelines of WHO, most of the countries opted for social distancing with lockdown as the only way to control the pandemic. This led to Manufacturing shut down, which acted as a spanner in the wheel for international supply chain leading to pressure on governments to review the protocols of the lockdown. We studied epidemiological parameters for 18 countries and obtained crossover time point referring to cumulative case active and case recovery rates and the time point for the peak positive confirmation rate in a time window of 92 days; and linked with the respective governmental decisions. For countries awaiting crossover, time series non-linear models could be used for predicting the crossover point. A sample study was carried out for India. The median time for reaching crossover for 12 countries was 37 days, while peak positive confirmation rate was 30 days after their first intervention. These countries enforced strict lockdown regulations and have shown constant improvement in their recovery rate even after crossover time point. A phase wise relaxation of lockdown is evident after crossover point in most of these countries. The crossover time point with the subsequent increasing recovery rate can be a strategy for lockdown relaxation as evident from the experiences of few countries. Also, we propose a criterion based on cumulative recovery and fatality rate for micro-management of lockdown.","Raje, D. V.; Bajaj, A.; Chakraborty, M.; Purohit, H. J.",,121,20

Supportive therapy remains the standard for mild-to-moderate cases, including treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) e.g. ibuprofen, however such medications may increase COVID-19 complications when used in patients with acute viral respiratory infections. P450 enzyme CYP2C9 are known to be involved in the metabolism of NSAIDs, however, their pharmacogenetic data are limited. This study aims to better understand the genetic landscape of CYP2C9 sequence variation across different ethnic and geographic groups, in correlation with ibuprofen dosing guidelines. A cohort of 101 Jordanian Arab samples were retrospectively recruited and genotyped using Affymetrix DMET Plus Premier Package. This study identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2C9 in these Jordanian Arabs, within the context of over 100,000 global subjects in 417 published reports. Genetic structure analysis across populations revealed that Jordanian Arabs share the closest CYP2C9 sequence homology to Near East and European populations. However, European populations are 7.2x more likely to show impaired ibuprofen metabolism than Sub-Saharan populations, and 4.5x more likely than East Asian ancestry populations.. This is the most comprehensive and up-to-date analysis for CYP2C9 allele frequencies across multi-ethnic populations world-wide. The use of modern genomic tools coupled with a proactive assessment of the most likely gene-drug candidates will lead to a better understanding of the role of pharmacogenetics for COVID-19 and more effective treatments.","Almarzooq, A.

This is a manifestation of a wider population phenomenon known as ""frailty variation"" in demography. Despite this theoretical understanding, public health policies continue to be guided by mathematical models that leave out most of the relevant variation and as a result inflate projected infection burdens. Here we focus on the trajectories of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in England and Scotland. We fit models to series of daily deaths and estimate relevant epidemiological parameters, including coefficients of variation which we find in agreement with direct measurements based on published contact surveys. Our estimates are robust to whether the data series encompass one or two pandemic waves. We conclude that herd immunity thresholds are being reached with a larger contribution of vaccination in Scotland than in England, where naturally acquired immunity is higher. These results are relevant to global vaccination policies.","Gomes, M. G. M.; Ferreira, M. U.; Chikina, M.; Pegden, W.; Aguas, R.",,121,1

The enzyme that carries out the process of transcription of mRNAs is RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which is a multi-subunit enzyme in eukaryotes. This protein biopolymer starts the transcription from specific sites and is positioned by transcription factors, which form a preinitiation complex (PIC) on gene promoters. To recognize and position the RNAPII and the transcription factors on the gene promoters are needed specific DNA sequences in the gene promoters, which are named promoter elements. Those gene promoter elements can vary and therefore several kinds of promoters exist, however, it appears that all promoters can use a similar pathway for PIC formation. Those pathways are discussed in this review. The in vitro transcribed mRNA can be used as vaccines to fight infectious diseases, e.g., in immunotherapy against cancer and in nanotechnology to deliver mRNA for a missing protein into the cell. We have outlined a procedure to produce an mRNA vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the causing agent of the big pandemic, COVID-19, affecting human beings all over the world. The potential advantages of using eukaryotic RNAPII to synthetize large transcripts are outlined and discussed. In addition, we suggest a method to cap the mRNA at the 5′ terminus by using enzymes, which might be more effective than cap analogs. Finally, we suggest the construction of a future multi-talented RNAPII, which would be able to synthetize large mRNA and cap them in the test tube.","Urbina, Fabiola; Morales-Pison, Sebastián; Maldonado, Edio",Polymers (Basel),121,5

Peoples’ ongoing sufferings trigger scientists to develop safe and effective remedies to treat this deadly viral disease. While repurposing the existing FDA-approved drugs remains in the front line, exploring drug candidates from synthetic and natural compounds is also a viable alternative. This study employed a comprehensive computational approach to screen inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 3CL-PRO (also known as the main protease), a prime molecular target to treat coronavirus diseases. METHODS: We performed 100 ns GROMACS molecular dynamics simulations of three high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of 3CL-PRO. We extracted frames at 10 ns intervals to mimic conformational diversities of the target protein in biological environments. We then used AutoDock Vina molecular docking to virtual screen the Sigma–Aldrich MyriaScreen Diversity Library II, a rich collection of 10,000 druglike small molecules with diverse chemotypes. Subsequently, we adopted in silico computation of physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic parameters, and toxicity profiles. Finally, we analyzed hydrogen bonding and other protein-ligand interactions for the short-listed compounds. RESULTS: Over the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations of 3CL-PRO’s crystal structures, 6LZE, 6M0K, and 6YB7, showed overall integrity with mean Cα root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.96 (±0.35) Å, 1.98 (±0.21) Å, and 1.94 (±0.25) Å, respectively. Average root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values were 1.21 ± 0.79 (6LZE), 1.12 ± 0.72 (6M0K), and 1.11 ± 0.60 (6YB7). After two phases of AutoDock Vina virtual screening of the MyriaScreen Diversity Library II, we prepared a list of the top 20 ligands. We selected four promising leads considering predicted oral bioavailability, druglikeness, and toxicity profiles. These compounds also demonstrated favorable protein-ligand interactions. We then employed 50-ns molecular dynamics simulations for the four selected molecules and the reference ligand 11a in the crystallographic structure 6LZE. Analysis of RMSF, RMSD, and hydrogen bonding along the simulation trajectories indicated that S51765 would form a more stable protein-ligand complexe with 3CL-PRO compared to other molecules. Insights into short-range Coulombic and Lennard-Jones potentials also revealed favorable binding of S51765 with 3CL-PRO. CONCLUSION: We identified a potential lead for antiviral drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Our results will aid global efforts to find safe and effective remedies for COVID-19.","Bepari, Asim Kumar; Reza, Hasan Mahmud",PeerJ,121,8

While multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays are available, no gold standard exists. METHODS: This serial cross-sectional study was conducted using plasma samples from 8999 healthy blood donors between April-September 2020. Each sample was tested by four assays: Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG assay, targeting nucleocapsid (Abbott-NP) and three in-house IgG ELISA assays (targeting spike glycoprotein, receptor binding domain, and nucleocapsid). Seroprevalence rates were compared using multiple composite reference standards and by a series of Bayesian Latent Class Models. RESULT: We found 13 unique diagnostic phenotypes; only 32 samples (0.4%) were positive by all assays. None of the individual assays resulted in seroprevalence increasing monotonically over time. In contrast, by using the results from all assays, the Bayesian Latent Class Model with informative priors predicted seroprevalence increased from 0.7% (95% credible interval (95% CrI); 0.4, 1.0%) in April/May to 0.7% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.1%) in June/July to 0.9% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.3) in August/September. Assay characteristics varied over time. Overall Spike had the highest sensitivity (93.5% (95% CrI 88.7, 97.3%), while the sensitivity of the Abbott-NP assay waned from 77.3% (95% CrI 58.7, 92.5%) in April/May to 64.4% (95% CrI 45.6, 83.0) by August/September. DISCUSSION: Our results confirmed very low seroprevalence after the first wave in Canada. Given the dynamic nature of this pandemic, Bayesian Latent Class Models can be used to correct for imperfect test characteristics and waning IgG antibody signals.","Saeed, Sahar; O’Brien, Sheila F.; Abe, Kento; Yi, Qi-Long; Rathod, Bhavisha; Wang, Jenny; Fazel-Zarandi, Mahya; Tuite, Ashleigh; Fisman, David; Wood, Heidi; Colwill, Karen; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Drews, Steven J.",PLoS One,121,16

CASE PRESENTATION A 56-year-old woman presented with recent unsteadiness and paraesthesia in both hands. Fifteen days earlier, she complained of fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Her chest X-ray showed a lobar consolidation and PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; she was admitted due to mild COVID-19 pneumonia.In the first 48 hours of hospitalisation, she started to experience lumbar pain and weakness of the proximal lower extremities, progressing to bilateral facial nerve palsy, oropharyngeal weakness and severe proximal tetraparesis with cervical flexion 2/5 on the MRC scale. A full spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a brainstem and cervical leptomeningeal enhancement. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albumin-cytological dissociation. Microbiological studies on CSF, including SARS-CoV-2, were negative. Nerve conduction studies were consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, with significant neurological improvement noted over the next 2 weeks. CONCLUSION Leptomeningeal enhancement is an atypical feature in GBS, but could be a marker of its association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sancho-Saldaña, Agustín; Lambea-Gil, Álvaro; Liesa, Jose Luis Capablo; Caballo, Maria Rosario Barrena; Garay, Maria Haddad; Celada, David Rivero; Serrano-Ponz, Marta",Clinical medicine,121,21

A number of antibiotics exhibit excellent bactericidal effects in vivo, such as fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides (gentamicin) and β-lactams (penicillin G, ceftiofur, or amoxicillin), but are less effective for treating STSLS. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new compounds that can reduce the damage caused by STSLS. In the present study, we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable FDA-approved anti-rheumatic drug as a candidate repurposed drug to treat severe S. suis infections. Our results showed that auranofin can bind to the functional domain of bacterial thioredoxin reductase, decreasing the reducing redox-responsive capacity of target bacteria and allowing for the killing of S. suis cells. We also observed that auranofin has antibacterial activity against other gram-positive bacteria, such as multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP), Streptococcus agalactiae, and vancomycin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, auranofin is capable of eradicating intracellular S.suis present inside infected macrophage cells. Mouse model experimental results showed that auranofin could effectively reduce the mortality of mice infected with S. suis. Compared to the ampicillin treatment group, the survival rate of mice in the auranofin treatment group in severely infected model mice was significantly improved. These results suggest that auranofin has the potential for use as an effective antibiotic against S. suis.","Lu, Hao; Lu, Wenjia; Zhu, Yongwei; Wang, Chenchen; Shi, Liming; Li, Xiaodan; Wu, Zhaoyuan; Wang, Gaoyan; Dong, Wenqi; Tan, Chen; Liu, Manli",Antibiotics (Basel),121,3

Since the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) case was reported, efforts to find a treatment and vaccine against COVID-19 have been widespread. METHODS: Four vaccines are on the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) emergency use listing and are approved of their usage; BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222, and Ad26.COV2.S. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 need at least 14 d to achieve effectiveness. Thus, people should abide by prevention and control measures, including wearing masks, washing hands, and social distancing. RESULTS: However, a lot of new cases were reported after vaccinations, as many people did not follow the prevention control measures before the end of the 14-d period. There is no doubt we need to break free from mask mandates. CONCLUSIONS: But let us not decide the timing in haste. Even if the mask mandates are eased, they should be changed depending on the number of reported cases, vaccinations, as well as prevention and control measures on how circumstances are changing under the influence of mutant coronavirus.","Kang, Yun-Jung",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,121,16

Here we evaluated the performance of a ddPCR-based assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 titer in 55 suspected COVID-19 cases with negative rtPCR results thanks to in-house ddPCR assay (targeting RdRp and host RNaseP). Samples were collected at ASST-GOM Niguarda between February and May 2020 at hospital admission. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging and definition of disease severity. Patients were mainly female (45.5%) with a median age of 73 (57–84) years. ddPCR-based assay detected SARS-CoV-2 genome in nasopharyngeal samples of 19 (34.5%) patients (median viral-load: 128 copies/mL, IQR: 72–345). In 15 of them (78.9%), chest CT showed a classical COVID-19 bilateral interstitial pneumonia; 14 patients (73.7%) showed severe COVID-19 manifestations. ddPCR did not identify any trace of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the respiratory samples of the remaining 36 patients.

The virus knowledge is limited and especially about COVID‐2019 pathogenesis. The Open Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of COVID‐2019 has been analyzed to evidence the presence of mutation caused by selective pressure on the virus. For selective pressure analysis fast‐unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) was used. Homology modelling has been performed by SwissModel and HHPred servers. The presence of transmembrane helical segments in Coronavirus ORF1ab non structural protein 2 (nsp2) and nsp3 was tested by TMHMM, MEMSAT, and MEMPACK tools. Three‐dimensional structures have been analyzed and displayed using PyMOL. FUBAR analysis revealed the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure (P < .05). Position 723 in the COVID‐2019 has a serine instead a glycine residue, while at aminoacidic position 1010 a proline instead an isoleucine. Significant (P < .05) pervasive negative selection in 2416 sites (55%) was found. The positive selective pressure could account for some clinical features of this virus compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Bat SARS‐like CoV. The stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome‐associated‐protein‐like domain of the nsp2 protein could account for COVID‐2019 high ability of contagious, while the destabilizing mutation in nsp3 proteins could suggest a potential mechanism differentiating COVID‐2019 from SARS.

METHOD: We assessed the effectiveness of convalescent whole blood (CWB) in the treatment of consented EVD patients. We recruited 69 subjects in December 2014 up to April 2015, at the 34 Military Hospital in Wilberforce and the PTS 1 Ebola Treatment Unit in Hastings, Freetown. Forty-four were given CWB, and 25 who consented but preferred to be exempted from the CWB treatment were used to compare clinical outcomes. All were given routine treatment used at the Ebola Treatment Unit. RESULTS: One of 44 subjects treated with CWB dropped out of the study and 31 recovered while 12 succumbed to the disease with a case fatality rate of 27.9%. For the group that was given routine treatment without CWB, 11 died with a case fatality rate of 44%. There was a significant difference between admission viral load and viral load after the first 24 h of treatment with convalescent whole blood (P < 0.01). The odds ratio for survival with CWB was 2.3 (95% CI, 0.8–6.5). CONCLUSION: CWB is promising for treating EVD in resource-poor settings, especially in the early phases of outbreaks when resource-mobilization is done. Even though our sample size was small and the evaluation was not randomised, our results contribute to existing evidence that convalescent whole blood could be considered as a useful candidate for treating EVD. Further studies that are randomised will be required to further assess the efficacy of CWB as treatment option during any EVD outbreak.","Sahr, F.; Ansumana, R.; Massaquoi, T.A.; Idriss, B.R.; Sesay, F.R.; Lamin, J.M.; Baker, S.; Nicol, S.; Conton, B.; Johnson, W.; Abiri, O.T.; Kargbo, O.; Kamara, P.; Goba, A.; Russell, J.B.W.; Gevao, S.M.",J Infect,121,20

Policy makers are utilizing social distancing and isolation policies to reduce the risk of transmission and spread of COVID-19, while the research, development, and testing of antiviral treatments and vaccines are ongoing. As part of these isolation policies, in-person healthcare delivery has been reduced, or eliminated, to avoid the risk of COVID-19 infection in high-risk and vulnerable populations, particularly those with comorbidities. Clinicians, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists have traditionally relied on in-person diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) and neurological conditions and illnesses. The assessment and rehabilitation of persons with acute and chronic conditions has, therefore, been particularly impacted during the pandemic. This article presents a perspective on how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), can be used to assist with assessment and rehabilitation for acute and chronic conditions.","Carriere, Jay; Shafi, Hareem; Brehon, Katelyn; Pohar Manhas, Kiran; Churchill, Katie; Ho, Chester; Tavakoli, Mahdi",Front Artif Intell,121,16

Seven distinct viral types were detected: 21–26 nm parvovirus‐like particles, 28–31 nm astrovirus‐like particles, a previously undescribed 34–35 nm ‘round’ virus particle, coronavirus, coronavirus‐like particles (CVLP), rotavirus and papova‐like virus. Parvovirus‐like particles alone were detected in 14 diarrhoeal and 50 normal faeces, astrovirus‐like particles in 3 normal faeces, “round” viruses in 4 normal faeces, coronavirus in 2 diarhoeal and 5 normal faeces, CVLP in one diarrhoeal and one normal faeces, rotavirus in 2 normal faeces, papova‐like virus in one normal faeces, both parvovirus‐like particles and coronavirus in 2 diarrhoeal and 2 normal faeces, parvovirus‐like particles and rotavirus in one normal faeces and parvovirus‐like and papova‐like virus in one normal faeces. The significance of these findings in canine and human disease is discussed.","MARSHALL, J. A.; HEALEY, D. S.; STUDDERT, M. J.; SCOTT, P. C.; KENNETT, M. L.; WARD, B. K.; GUST, I.

In this study, we analyze this relationship by building a behaviorome, or set of digital behavior markers, from a fusion of data collected from ambient and wearable sensors. We then use the behaviorome to predict clinical scores for a sample of n = 21 participants based on continuous data collected from smart homes and smartwatches and automatically labeled with corresponding activity and location types. To further investigate the relationship between domains, including participant demographics, self-report and external observation-based health scores, and behavior markers, we propose a joint inference technique that improves predictive performance for these types of high-dimensional spaces. For our participant sample, we observe correlations ranging from small to large for the clinical scores. We also observe an improvement in predictive performance when multiple sensor modalities are used and when joint inference is employed.","COOK, DIANE J.; SCHMITTER-EDGECOMBE, MAUREEN",IEEE Access,121,20

Serologic tests based on ELISA have been developed and evaluated as useful complements to PCR in these situations. However, there is scarce information about the usefulness of rapid tests based on immunochromatography. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of these rapid tests in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COV-19 IgG / IgM kit) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. First, we performed a validation of the serologic test using serum samples from 45 healthy control patients (group 1) and 55 confirmed by PCR cases of COVID-19 (group 2) in order to establish the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Then we prospectively employed the test in 63 patients diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology that were SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR (group 3), to establish the diagnostic performance in these patients. Results: All patients from group 1 (healthy controls) resulted negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100%). Regarding group 2 (PCR positive) patients, the median time from the onset of symptoms was 11 days and the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 26 out of 55 patients (overall sensitivity = 47.3%). However, in those patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 73.9%. Regarding group 3 patients, the median days from onset of symptoms was 17 and the test was positive in 56 out of 63 patients (88.9% positivity rate). In these group 3 patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the positivity rate was 91.1%. Conclusions: Our study shows that serologic rapid tests can be used as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms. These immunochromatographic devices could be especially useful in hospitalized patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology with 14 or more days from the onset of symptoms and in whom the PCR has been negative.","Garcia, Felipe Perez; Perez Tanoira, Ramon; Romanyk Cabrera, Juan Pedro; Arroyo Serrano, Teresa; Gomez Herruz, Peña; Cuadros Gonzalez, Juan",,121,16
