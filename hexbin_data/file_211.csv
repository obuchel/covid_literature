575,Non-Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) IgGs from Malian Children Interfere with Functional Activity of AMA1 IgGs as Judged by Growth Inhibition Assay,2011-06-13,"BACKGROUND: Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is one of the best-studied blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates. When an AMA1 vaccine was tested in a malaria naïve population, it induced functionally active antibodies judged by Growth Inhibition Assay (GIA). However, the same vaccine failed to induce higher growth-inhibitory activity in adults living in a malaria endemic area. Vaccination did induce functionally active antibodies in malaria-exposed children with less than 20% inhibition in GIA at baseline, but not in children with more than that level of baseline inhibition. METHODS: Total IgGs were purified from plasmas collected from the pediatric trial before and after immunization and pools of total IgGs were made. Another set of total IgGs was purified from U.S. adults immunized with AMA1 (US-total IgG). From these total IgGs, AMA1-specific and non-AMA1 IgGs were affinity purified and the functional activity of these IgGs was evaluated by GIA. Competition ELISA was performed with the U.S.-total IgG and non-AMA1 IgGs from malaria-exposed children. RESULTS: AMA1-specific IgGs from malaria-exposed children and U.S. vaccinees showed similar growth-inhibitory activity at the same concentrations. When mixed with U.S.-total IgG, non-AMA1 IgGs from children showed an interference effect in GIA. Interestingly, the interference effect was higher with non-AMA1 IgGs from higher titer pools. The non-AMA1 IgGs did not compete with anti-AMA1 antibody in U.S.-total IgG in the competition ELISA. CONCLUSION: Children living in a malaria endemic area have a fraction of IgGs that interferes with the biological activity of anti-AMA1 antibody as judged by GIA. While the mechanism of interference is not resolved in this study, these results suggest it is not caused by direct competition between non-AMA1 IgG and AMA1 protein. This study indicates that anti-malaria IgGs induced by natural exposure may interfere with the biological effect of antibody induced by an AMA1-based vaccine in the target population.","Miura, Kazutoyo; Perera, Suwani; Brockley, Sarah; Zhou, Hong; Aebig, Joan A.; Moretz, Samuel E.; Miller, Louis H.; Doumbo, Ogobara K.; Sagara, Issaka; Dicko, Alassane; Ellis, Ruth D.; Long, Carole A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3113848/,211

11536,Development of a measure of stigma towards occupational stress for mental health professionals,2020-01-02,"PURPOSE: This article aims to analyze the intersections between delirium, physical exercise and rehabilitation, to better understand their interrelation and to visualize future lines of research. METHODS: In this narrative review, after an overview of brain neurophysiology and function, as common substrates to understand the relationship between delirium and physical function, we explore the scientific evidence in: (1) physical dysfunction as a risk factor for delirium; (2) physical dysfunction as a symptom of delirium and (3) functional consequences related to delirium. Later, we analyze the physical therapy as one of the main strategies in multicomponent interventions to prevent delirium, by examining intervention studies including rehabilitation, which have shown to be effective in managing delirium. Finally, we analyze how frailty, delirium and physical exercise interact with each other. RESULTS: This review confirms the close relationship between delirium and physical dysfunction; therefore, it is not surprising that physical exercise is widely used in delirium preventive strategies. Although delirium is catalogued as a neurocognitive disorder, scientific evidence shows that it is also a motor disorder, which is to be expected, since a vast body of literature already supports an interaction between motor and cognitive function. CONCLUSION: The motor component of delirium should be taken into account when designing interventions or strategies to address delirium. These interventions may have a special importance in frail older adults.","Gual, N.; García-Salmones, M.; Brítez, L.; Crespo, N.; Udina, C.; Pérez, L.

13149,Relative accuracy of social and medical determinants of suicide in electronic health records,2020-09-02,"Endothelium-derived steroidogenic factor (EDSF) is an endothelial peptide that stimulates aldosterone release from bovine adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells. The regulation of aldosterone release by combinations of EDSF and angiotensin II (AII) or EDSF and ACTH was investigated. Endothelial cells (ECs) and EC-conditioned media (ECCM) increased aldosterone release from ZG cells, an activity attributed to EDSF. AII (10(−12) to 10(−8)m) and ACTH (10(−12) to 10(−9)m) also stimulated the release of aldosterone from ZG cells. The stimulation by AII, but not ACTH, was greatly enhanced when ZG cells were coincubated with ECs. AII was metabolized by ECs to peptides identified by mass spectrometry as angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin IV. There was very little metabolism of AII by ZG cells. Neither of these two AII metabolites altered aldosterone release from ZG cells, so they could not account for the enhanced response with ECs. AII-induced aldosterone release from ZG cells was enhanced by ECCM but not cell-free conditioned medium. This enhanced response was not due to increased EDSF release from ECs by AII. The synergistic effect of EDSF and AII was apparent when AII was added during or after the generation of ECCM and not observed when the AII component of the enhancement was blocked by the AII antagonist, losartan. These studies indicate that EDSF enhances the steroidogenic effect of AII. In the adrenal gland, ECs are in close anatomical relationship with ZG cells and may sensitize ZG cells to the steroidogenic action of AII by releasing EDSF.","Hanke, Craig J.; Holmes, Blythe B.; Xu, Yafei; Nithipatikom, Kasem; Campbell, William B.",Endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7539562/,211

In vitro study: The traditional cuff pressure measurement method (the cuff pressure gauge before measurement shows 0 cm H(2)O) and the modified cuff pressure measurement method (the cuff pressure before measurement shows 25 cm H(2)O, 28 cm H(2)O, 30 cm H(2)O or 32 cm H(2)O) were used to measure cylindrical and tapered cuffs, and the effect of different inflation volume on cuff pressure was analyzed statistically. Clinical study: patients with the artificial airway established by orotracheal intubation or tracheotomy in Neuro-ICU were prospectively selected as subjects, and the measurement procedure was the same as in vitro study. In vitro study showed that the pressure loss values of cylindrical cuff and tapered cuff using the traditional cuff pressure measurement method were (3.75 ± 0.31) cm H(2)O and (4.92 ± 0.44) cm H(2)O, respectively, and clinical study showed that the pressure loss values were (5.07 ± 0.83) cm H(2)O and (5.17 ± 0.93) cm H(2)O, respectively. The actual measured values measured by the traditional cuff pressure measurement method of the two cuff shapes were compared with the corrected target value of 28 cm H(2)O, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.000). Both in vitro and clinical study had shown that all differences between the actual measured value and the corrected target value using the modified cuff pressure measurement method (measured with 25 cm H(2)O, 30 cm H(2)O, 32 cm H(2)O) were statistically significant (P < 0.000), and the range of overall differences was (0–1.23 ± 0.25) cm H(2)O. In vitro study had shown that the pressure variation coefficient (CV) of the tapered cuff was greater than that of the cylindrical cuff, and the difference was statistically significant (3.08 ± 0.25 VS 2.41 ± 0.21, P < 0.000). The traditional cuff pressure measurement method can directly lead to the cuff pressure drop, which is easy to cause the leakage of secretions on the cuffs and the misjudgment of the cuff pressure by medical personnel. However, the modified cuff pressure measurement method can effectively reduce cuff pressure loss, and taking the actual cuff pressure value as the inflation volume is the highest measurement accuracy.The tapered cuff is more susceptible to air volume, so it is necessary to pay attention to its measurement and correction in clinical practice.","Xiang, Lijun; Cao, Meng; Song, Xuemei; Tan, Miaoqin; Deng, Taosheng; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Xiaomei",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7951126/,211

16633,Family Medicine Physicians’ Perspectives Regarding Rural Behavioral Health Care: Informing Ideas for Increasing Access to High-Quality Services,2021-04-06,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common complication of systemic inflammation or sepsis with high morbidity and mortality. Although many studies have confirmed that helminth-derived proteins had strong immunomodulatory functions and could be used to treat inflammatory diseases, there is no report on the therapeutic effect of excretory-secretory products of Trichinella spiralis adult worms (Ts-AES) on sepsis-induced ALI. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of Ts-AES on sepsis-induced ALI and the underlying immunological mechanism and the signaling pathway were investigated. The results indicated that after being treated with Ts-AES, the survival rate of mice with CLP-induced sepsis was significantly increased to 50% for 72 hours after CLP surgery compared to PBS control group with all mice died. The sepsis-induced ALI was largely mitigated characterized by reduced inflammation cell infiltration and pathological changes in lung tissue, with decreased lung injury scores and lung wet/dry weight ratio. The therapeutic efficacy of Ts-AES is associated with stimulated Tregs response with increased regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β). The expression of HMGB1, TLR2 and MyD88 in lung tissue was inhibited after treatment of Ts-AES. Our results demonstrated that Ts-AES play an important role in immunomodulation and confer a therapeutic effect on sepsis-induced ALI through inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines. The activation of Tregs and increased level of regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β are possibly involved in the immunomodulatory functions of Ts-AES through HMGB1/TLR2/MyD88 signal pathway. The findings suggest Ts-AES is a potential therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of sepsis-induced ALI and other inflammatory diseases.","Li, Huihui; Qiu, Dapeng; Yang, Huijuan; Yuan, Yuan; Wu, Lingqin; Chu, Liang; Zhan, Bin; Wang, Xiaoli; Sun, Yan; Xu, Wei; Yang, Xiaodi",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024484/,211

19583,Long working hours and health,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robots (SARs) have been proposed as a tool to help individuals who have had a stroke to perform their exercise during their rehabilitation process. Yet, to date, there are no data on the motivating benefit of SARs in a long-term interaction with post-stroke patients. METHODS: Here, we describe a robot-based gamified exercise platform, which we developed for long-term post-stroke rehabilitation. The platform uses the humanoid robot Pepper, and also has a computer-based configuration (with no robot). It includes seven gamified sets of exercises, which are based on functional tasks from the everyday life of the patients. The platform gives the patients instructions, as well as feedback on their performance, and can track their performance over time. We performed a long-term patient-usability study, where 24 post-stroke patients were randomly allocated to exercise with this platform—either with the robot or the computer configuration—over a 5–7 week period, 3 times per week, for a total of 306 sessions. RESULTS: The participants in both groups reported that this rehabilitation platform addressed their arm rehabilitation needs, and they expressed their desire to continue training with it even after the study ended. We found a trend for higher acceptance of the system by the participants in the robot group on all parameters; however, this difference was not significant. We found that system failures did not affect the long-term trust that users felt towards the system. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the usability of using this platform for a long-term rehabilitation with post-stroke patients in a clinical setting. We found high levels of acceptance of both platform configurations by patients following this interaction, with higher ratings given to the SAR configuration. We show that it is not the mere use of technology that increases the motivation of the person to practice, but rather it is the appreciation of the technology’s effectiveness and its perceived contribution to the rehabilitation process. In addition, we provide a list of guidelines that can be used when designing and implementing other technological tools for rehabilitation.

20229,Availability of facility resources and services and infection-related maternal outcomes in the WHO Global Maternal Sepsis Study: a cross-sectional study,2021-07-21,"Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, is approved for use in the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Although its efficacy and safety have been well established in clinical studies, in real-world settings, different practice scenarios have been reported. This review paper serves to evaluate clinical real-world scenarios and aspects of treatment for which the information in the literature was considered to be lacking or controversial. Following a literature review, a panel of five dermatologists with expertise in psoriasis considered five scenarios; namely, the positioning of apremilast in psoriasis, its use in difficult-to-treat areas, special conditions and populations, safety, dose titration and dose in maintenance therapy. These were then assessed with psoriasis experts in India using a web-based questionnaire. A total of 28 questions were discussed regarding these scenarios. According to the responses, apremilast is effective in stable mild to moderate psoriasis as monotherapy and in severe psoriasis in combination. Also, a positive response was received with regard to its effectiveness in difficult locations such as the scalp, palms and soles. To reduce adverse effects, prolonged titration therapy over 4 weeks is required and lower doses can be prescribed to maintain remission. Apremilast therapy should be continued for a minimum of 8 weeks once initiated to achieve the desired results, and the total duration of therapy should be about 24 weeks for better efficacy. It is also effective in many other cases, such as obese patients, patients with hepatitis B or C and HIV, or patients on polypharmacy. It was also reported that apremilast requires less prescreening and monitoring than other conventional and biologic systemic therapies. Overall, apremilast is an attractive option for the individualized treatment of psoriasis owing to its favorable safety profile, its ease of oral administration without the need for screening or ongoing laboratory monitoring, and its positive impact on symptoms and lesions in difficult-to-treat areas.","Rajagopalan, Murlidhar; Dogra, Sunil; Saraswat, Abir; Varma, Sachin; Banodkar, Pravin",Psoriasis (Auckl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8375310/,211

As a kind of application layer DDoS attack, Challenge Collapsar (CC) attack has become a real headache for defenders. However, there are many researches on DDoS attack, but few on CC attack. The related works on CC attack employ rule-based and machine learning-based models, and just validate their models on the outdated public datasets. These works appear to lag behind once the attack pattern changes. In this paper, we present a model based on packet Field Differentiated Preprocessing and Deep neural network (FDPD) to address this problem. Besides, we collected a fresh dataset which contains 7.92 million packets from real network traffic to train and validate FDPD model. The experimental results show that the accuracy of this model reaches 98.55%, the [Formula: see text] value reaches 98.59%, which is 3% higher than the previous models (SVM and Random Forest-based detection model), and the training speed is increased by 17 times in the same environment.

Use of machine learning in manufacturing environments is increasing, yet sometimes these applications fail to produce meaningful results. A critical review of how defects are classified is needed to appropriately apply machine learning in a production foundry and other manufacturing processes. Four elements associated with defect classification are proposed: Binary Acceptance Specifications, Stochastic Formation of Defects, Secondary Process Variation, and Visual Defect Inspection. These four elements create data space overlap, which influences the bias associated with training supervised machine learning algorithms. If this influence is significant enough, the predicted error of the model exceeds a critical error threshold (CET). There is no financial motivation to implement the ML model in the manufacturing environment if its error is greater than the CET. The goal is to bring awareness to these four elements, define the critical error threshold, and offer guidance and future study recommendations on data collection and machine learning that will increase the success of ML within manufacturing.","Blondheim, David",Inter Metalcast,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223532/,211

Within the social care sector, the pandemic has increased job demands and prolonged stress taking a disproportionate toll on the workforce, particularly social workers. This article compares the mental well-being and quality of working life of social workers in the United Kingdom (UK) before and during the pandemic. Data were collected in 2018 (N = 1,195) and 2020 (N = 1,024) using two cross-sectional surveys. To account for the differences between the datasets, propensity score matching was employed prior to effect estimation, utilising demographic and work-related variables common to both datasets. The differences between the two time-points were estimated using multiple regressions. Both mental well-being and quality of working life were significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to 2018. This suggests that during the highpoint of the pandemic in the UK, increased support, and changes to working practices, such as reprioritisation of work and other initiatives, may be responsible for increased mental well-being and quality of working life. While acknowledging the known pressures on UK social workers during the COVID-19 pandemic this evidence suggests a mixed picture of the pandemic with lessons for managers and employers.","McFadden, Paula; Neill, Ruth D; Mallett, John; Manthorpe, Jill; Gillen, Patricia; Moriarty, John; Currie, Denise; Schroder, Heike; Ravalier, Jermaine; Nicholl, Patricia; Ross, Jana",Br J Soc Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500158/,211

Community health centers serve the patient populations most vulnerable to the disease yet often have inadequate resources to combat it. Academic medical centers do not always have the community connections needed for the most effective population health approaches. We describe how a bridge between a community health center partner (Roots Community Health Center) and a large academic medical center (Stanford Medicine) brought complementary strengths together to address the regional public health crisis. The 2 institutions began the crisis with an overlapping clinical and research faculty member (NKT). Building on that foundation, we worked in 3 areas. First, we partnered to reach underserved populations with the academic center's newly developed COVID test.

64285,Assessment of hospital emergency management in the Beijing area.,2011,"Early diagnosis and therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is critical to improve the five-year survival rates of patients. Theranostic agents synergized with photothermal ablation are expected to realize the early detection and treatment of orthotopic HCC. However, conventional metallic nanoagents are limited by their potential bio-toxicity to surrounding normal organs. Recently, endogenous biological melanin pigments have been utilized to develop nanoplatforms due to their excellent biocompatibility and degradability. Whereas, the insufficient capability of PEGylated melanin nanoparticles (PEG-MNPs) in photoacoustic (PA) imaging limits their further biomedical applications. Paradoxically, it is difficult to meet these two different requirements. Herein, a multifunctional nanoagent based on melanin (MNPs) conjugating the near-infrared (NIR) dye IR820 was successfully designed and fabricated. Encapsulation by polyethylene glycol (PEG) renders the solubility in water and allows the physical absorption of IR820 for enhanced photoacoustic (PA) performance and photothermal therapy. Besides, PEG coating on the surface of IR820-PEG-MNPs resulted in a reduction in swallowing in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and spleen, prolonging the circulation time in the blood and increasing the accumulation in the tumor. The IR820-PEG-MNPs displayed satisfactory PA and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals in aqueous solution as well as strong photothermal efficiency. Compared with prior injection, PA/MR signals of the tumor region were enhanced by 4.13- and 1.60-fold, respectively, which could effectively detect lesions smaller than ∼1.8 mm. Furthermore, the high photothermal conversion efficiency (40.2%) endowed the IR820-PEG-MNPs with the capability of selectively ablating tumors in orthotopic HCC mouse models under the guidance of PA/MR imaging. This work broadens the biomedical applications of melanin-based agent, which are promising for the precise diagnosis of orthotopic micro HCC and imaging guided photothermal ablation.","Chen, Kang; Li, Qiaolin; Zhao, Xingyang; Zhang, Jinde; Ma, Haosong; Sun, Xiang; Yu, Qian; Zhang, Yueming; Fang, Chihua; Nie, Liming",Biomaterials science,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00825g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602480/,211

We reviewed the trends of the epidemic from the 27th February to the 31st May 2020, when it reached the 10,000th mark vis-à-vis government policies to contain the spread of the disease. Methods We used publicly available data from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control from 27th February 2020, when Nigeria recorded her first coronavirus disease 2019 case to the 31st May 2020. We used line graphs to describe the trends of the daily course of cumulative cases, discharges and deaths in states and nationally. The doubling time, transmission rates were inferred from these trends and the epidemiological curve generated was reviewed vis-a-vis the instituted government policies over the specified period. Results The epidemic curve in Nigeria has been on an upward trajectory as the number of cases crossed the 10,000 marks, 3 months after the first case was recorded. The first spike in the number of new cases was observed on the 21st April 2020, with 117 cases. The number of daily deaths within the study period was highest on the 2nd May 2020 (17 new deaths). Geo-political zone variations were also observed. Of the 63,882 screening tests conducted during the study period, 15.9% tested positive; the doubling time and transmission rates were 23.5 days and 1.0%, respectively, as at 31st May 2020. Since the lockdown measures were lifted in Lagos and the FCT on the 4th May 2020, the number of cases has been on a steady increase each week. Conclusion and Recommendations In Nigeria, the epidemic curve has been on an upward direction since the first reported case and it took 3 months to reach 10,000 cases. We recommend a sustained drive in the enforcement of physical and social distancing and increase in testing capacity to flatten the epidemic curve.","Odukoya, Oluwakemi Ololade; Adejimi, Adebola A; Isikekpei, Brenda; Jim, Chris S; Osibogun, Akin; Ogunsola, Folasade Tolulope",The Nigerian postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.4103/npmj.npmj_233_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154278/,211

In an attempt to mitigate resource limitations, the psychiatric practice has been undergoing a paradigm shift into digitalized mental health interventions. One such innovation involves digital gaming utilizing the principles of 'gamification' to incorporate both the playfulness component of online gaming as well as the domain-targeted design of gaming elements. Digital gaming-based interventions have been to deliver psychotherapy, biofeedback, cognitive training and rehabilitation, as well as behavioural modification and social skills training. Research shows their utility in autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit disorders, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress, eating disorders, neurocognitive disorders and also to promote healthy aging. Though promising in scope, these interventions face pragmatic challenges for implementation in developing countries. Even though increased use of technology, internet penetration and growing digital literacy have enhanced their accessibility and feasibility, various factors like socio-cultural diversity, lack of standardization, poor infrastructural support, bandwidth issues and lack of practice can impair their use and acceptability.

A unique transcriptional response is initiated by hypoxia which includes the rapid activation of numerous transcription factors in a background of reduced global transcription. Here, we show that the biological response to hypoxia includes the accumulation of R-loops and the induction of the RNA/DNA helicase SETX. In the absence of hypoxia-induced SETX, R-loop levels increase, DNA damage accumulates, and DNA replication rates decrease. Therefore, suggesting that, SETX plays a role in protecting cells from DNA damage induced during transcription in hypoxia. Importantly, we propose that the mechanism of SETX induction in hypoxia is reliant on the PERK/ATF4 arm of the unfolded protein response. These data not only highlight the unique cellular response to hypoxia, which includes both a replication stress-dependent DNA damage response and an unfolded protein response but uncover a novel link between these two distinct pathways.","Ramachandran, Shaliny; Ma, Tiffany S; Griffin, Jon; Ng, Natalie; Foskolou, Iosifina P; Hwang, Ming-Shih; Victori, Pedro; Cheng, Wei-Chen; Buffa, Francesca M; Leszczynska, Katarzyna B; El-Khamisy, Sherif F; Gromak, Natalia; Hammond, Ester M",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24066-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140498/,211

Endogenous GU-rich miRNAs activate endosomal TLR7 that plays a critical role in autoimmune diseases. We found that endogenous TLR7 ligands, miR-29 and miR-Let7b, were markedly increased in PsA compared to osteoarthritis (OA) synovial fluid (SF)s. We showed that intradermal (i.d.) miR-Let7b injection promoted skin inflammation, which was characterized by amplified Th1 cells, CD68+ M1 macrophages and transcriptional upregulation of glycolytic mediators, GLUT1, C-MYC and HIF1α. Expansion of skin Th1 cells driven by miR-Let7b was also linked to elevated M1-associated IRFs. Interestingly, i.d. miR-Let7b administration exacerbated suboptimal joint inflammation along with metabolic reconfiguration of the PsA-like preclinical model. Moreover, TLR7 agonist, R837, potentiated metabolic reprogramming and expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12 in murine macrophages, enabling myeloid-to-T cell crosstalk. Consistently, treatment with glycolytic inhibitors, 2-DG and/or HIF1αi, reversed R837-induced metabolic remodeling and disrupted the TLR7-driven inflammatory phenotype in myeloid and lymphoid cells. Similar to miR-Let7b, R837 also differentiates progenitor cells into mature osteoclasts, primarily through RANKL induction. Taken together, this study indicates that TLR7-instigated metabolic rewiring of macrophages and their cross-regulation of T cells connects skin immunopathology to joint inflammation.

We have reviewed reports of clinical findings in patients with a number of inborn errors of cobalamin or folate metabolism, specifically looking for immune problems. FINDINGS There is little evidence that immune function is affected in most of the disorders. Exceptions are Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome and hereditary folate malabsorption (affecting intestinal absorption of cobalamin and folate, respectively), transcobalamin deficiency (affecting transport of cobalamin in blood and cellular cobalamin uptake), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 deficiency (catalyzing cytoplasmic interconversion of reduced folate coenzyme derivatives).

To meet this challenge hospitals need a Disaster Response Plan and a Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) as a crisis leadership tool. The complex dependency between the systems staff, supplies, and space during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major problem for hospitals. To take the appropriate countermeasures, the effects of the crisis on these systems must be detected, analyzed, and displayed. The presentation and interpretation of such complex processes often poses serious problems for the hospitals' incident commanders. In this article, we describe a new model that is able to display these complex interrelationships within the command process. The model was developed and deployed during the disaster response to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in order to facilitate the entire command process and to improve hospital disaster response. The approach of the model is as simple as it is innovative. It perfectly symbolizes the basic principle of disaster medicine: keep is safe and simple. It will help hospitals to improve command and control and to optimize the disaster response during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Wurmb, Thomas; Ertl, Georg; Ernestus, Ralf-Ingo; Meybohm, Patrick",Journal of emergency management,https://doi.org/10.5055/jem.2020.0520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351181/,211

We aimed to summarize the prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults living at high altitude. METHODS We searched in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase and included the studies published from inception to July 20, 2020, with no language restriction, which reported the frequency of cognitive impairment or dementia in older adults living at high-altitude populations. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate the overall prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of cognitive impairment and dementia. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) adapted for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS Six studies were included (3,724 participants), and 5 of the 6 included studies were carried out in Latin America. The altitude ranged from 1,783 to 3,847 m, the proportion of women included varied from 38.7 to 65.6%, and the proportion of participants with elementary or illiterate educational level ranged from 71.7 to 97.6%. The overall prevalence of cognitive impairment was 22.0% (95% CI: 8-40, I2: 99%), and the overall prevalence of dementia was 11.0% (95% CI: 6-17, I2: 92%). In a subgroup analysis according to the instrument used to evaluate cognitive impairment, the prevalence of cognitive impairment was 21.0% (95% CI: 5-42, I2: 99%) in the MMSE group while the prevalence was 29.0% (95% CI: 0-78) in the non-MMSE group.

METHODS A survey was sent to 872 health professionals caring for women with EBC. Questions addressed most common GUS seen, experience treating GUS, and attitudes to treatment options. RESULTS 144 surveys were completed. Respondent characteristics: median age 50 years; 76% female; 42% medical oncologists; 24% nurses; 20% breast surgeons; 8% radiation oncologists. Most (68%) reported prescribing endocrine therapies for EBC, 99% were aware endocrine therapies can cause GUS, and 55% reported ""often"" or ""always"" asking patients on endocrine therapy if they have GUS. Respondents thought vaginal dryness was the most bothersome symptom for their patients (66%), followed by dyspareunia (11%). 81% of respondents reported seeing women stop endocrine therapy prematurely due to GUS. Respondents reported receiving ""none"" (19%) or ""a little"" (46%) training or education in managing GUS and only 16% reported feeling ""very confident"" managing GUS. The proportions of respondents reporting ""often"" and ""very often"" recommending the following vaginal treatments were: lubricants (81%); moisturisers (68%); oestrogens (21%); and laser (3%). Vaginal oestrogens were considered ""safe"" or ""probably safe"" by 77% and 90% of respondents for women with hormone receptor positive and negative EBC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Despite health professionals frequently encountering GUS in women with EBC and seeing patients stop endocrine therapies prematurely, only 16% felt confident managing these symptoms.

DESIGN A randomized, prospective, blind study. SETTING A single university hospital. PARTICIPANTS The study comprised 133 patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly allocated into the following 4 groups of DLTs: Macintosh (n = 32), GlideScope (n = 34), Airtraq (n = 35), or KVL (n = 32). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The following data were recorded: time required for achieving successful DLT intubation; glottis visualization; optimization maneuvers; first-pass success rate; intubation difficulty; failure to intubate, defined as an attempt taking >150 seconds to perform or if peripheral oxygen saturation <92% was noted; and postoperative sore throat and hoarseness were recorded. Compared with GlideScope, the Airtraq resulted in shorter times for achieving successful DLT intubation (median times: 21 s [95% confidence interval 23.9-70.8 s] v 57.5 s [95% confidence interval 46.2-89.1 s], respectively; p = 0.021); a lower score for difficult intubations (p = 0.023); and fewer optimization maneuvers. The 4 laryngoscopes were associated with comparable glottis visualization; first-pass success rate (100%, 100%, 94.4%, and 100%, respectively; p = 0.522); incidence of oropharyngeal trauma; postoperative sore throat; and hoarseness of voice. There were 2 (5.7%) endobronchial intubation failures using the Airtraq due to the inability to advance the DLT through the glottis opening. The experience of the anesthesiologists in using the 4 devices had a statistically significant negative correlation with the time to confirmation of endobronchial intubation (Spearman r -0.392; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION When used by operators with mixed experience, the channeled Airtraq required less time for DLT intubation and was easier to use than the GlideScope, although failures did occur with the Airtraq, whereas they did not occur with the other systems.","El-Tahan, Mohamed R; Khidr, Alaa M; Gaarour, Ihab S; Alshadwi, Saeed A; Alghamdi, Talal M; Al'ghamdi, Abdulmohsen",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2017.08.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056498/,211

We compared laparoscopic ileocaecal resection with infliximab to assess how they affect health-related quality of life. METHODS In this randomised controlled, open-label trial, in 29 teaching hospitals and tertiary care centres in the Netherlands and the UK, adults with non-stricturing, ileocaecal Crohn's disease, in whom conventional therapy has failed were randomly allocated (1:1) by an internet randomisation module with biased-coin minimisation for participating centres and perianal fistula to receive laparoscopic ileocaecal resection or infliximab. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years, had active Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum, and had not responded to at least 3 months of conventional therapy with glucocorticosteroids, thiopurines, or methotrexate. Patients with diseased terminal ileum longer than 40 cm or abdominal abscesses were excluded. The primary outcome was quality of life on the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were general quality of life, measured by the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey and its physical and mental component subscales, days unable to participate in social life, days on sick leave, morbidity (additional procedures and hospital admissions), and body image and cosmesis. Analyses of the primary outcome were done in the intention-to-treat population, and safety analyses were done in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered at the Dutch Trial Registry (NTR1150). FINDINGS Between May 2, 2008, and October 14, 2015, 73 patients were allocated to have resection and 70 to receive infliximab. Corrected for baseline differences, the mean IBDQ score at 12 months was 178·1 (95% CI 171·1-185·0) in the resection group versus 172·0 (164·3-179·6) in the infliximab group (mean difference 6·1 points, 95% CI -4·2 to 16·4; p=0·25). At 12 months, the mean SF-36 total score was 112·1 (95% CI 108·0-116·2) in the resection group versus 106·5 (102·1-110·9) in the infliximab group (mean difference 5·6, 95% CI -0·4 to 11·6), the mean physical component score was 47·7 (45·7-49·7) versus 44·6 (42·5-46·8; mean difference 3·1, 4·2 to 6·0), and the mean mental component score was 49·5 (47·0-52·1) versus 46·1 (43·3-48·9; mean difference 3·5, -0·3 to 7·3). Mean numbers of days of sick leave were 3·4 days (SD 7·1) in the resection group versus 1·4 days (4·7) in the infliximab group (p<0·0001), days not able to take part in social life were 1·8 days (6·3) versus 1·1 days (4·5; p=0·20), days of scheduled hospital admission were 6·5 days (3·8) versus 6·8 days (3·2; p=0·84), and the number of patients who had unscheduled hospital admissions were 13 (18%) of 73 versus 15 (21%) of 70 (p=0·68). Body-image scale mean scores in the patients who had resection were 16·0 (95% CI 15·2-16·8) at baseline versus 17·8 (17·1-18·4) at 12 months, and cosmetic scale mean scores were 17·6 (16·6-18·6) versus 18·6 (17·6-19·6). Surgical intervention-related complications classified as IIIa or worse on the Clavien-Dindo scale occurred in four patients in the resection group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in two patients in the infliximab group. During a median follow-up of 4 years (IQR 2-6), 26 (37%) of 70 patients in the infliximab group had resection, and 19 (26%) of 73 patients in the resection group received anti-TNF. INTERPRETATION Laparoscopic resection in patients with limited (diseased terminal ileum <40 cm), non-stricturing, ileocaecal Crohn's disease in whom conventional therapy has failed could be considered a reasonable alternative to infliximab therapy.

Place of care is implicated, influencing access to specialist TYA professionals and research.Consequently, age-appropriate specialist cancer care is advocated for TYA although systematic investigation of associated outcomes is lacking. In England, age-appropriate care is delivered through 13 Principal Treatment Centres (TYA-PTC). BRIGHTLIGHT is the national evaluation of TYA cancer services to examine outcomes associated with differing places and levels of care. We aimed to examine the association between exposure to TYA-PTC care, survival and documentation of clinical processes of care. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING 109 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals across England. PARTICIPANTS 1114 TYA, aged 13-24, newly diagnosed with cancer between 2012 and 2014. INTERVENTION Participants were assigned a TYA-PTC category dependent on the proportion of care delivered in a TYA-PTC in the first year after diagnosis: all care in a TYA-PTC (ALL-TYA-PTC, n=270), no care in a TYA-PTC (NO-TYA-PTC, n=359), and some care in a TYA-PTC with additional care in a children's/adult unit (SOME-TYA-PTC, n=419). PRIMARY OUTCOME Data were collected on documented processes indicative of age-appropriate care using clinical report forms, and survival through linkage to NHS databases. RESULTS TYA receiving NO-TYA-PTC care were less likely to have documentation of molecular diagnosis, be reviewed by a children's or TYA multidisciplinary team, be assessed by supportive care services or have a fertility discussion. There was no significant difference in survival according to category of care. There was weak evidence that the association between care category and survival differed by age (p=0.08) with higher HRs for those over 19 receiving ALL or SOME-TYA-PTC compared with NO-TYA-PTC. CONCLUSION TYA-PTC care was associated with better documentation of clinical processes associated with age-appropriate care but not improved survival.","Fern, Lorna A; Taylor, Rachel M; Barber, Julie; Alvarez-Galvez, Javier; Feltbower, Richard; Lea, Sarah; Martins, Ana; Morris, Stephen; Hooker, Louise; Gibson, Faith; Raine, Rosalind; Stark, Dan P; Whelan, Jeremy",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827838/,211
80415,Hospital Emergency Readiness Overview study.,2011,"OBJECTIVES to describe the organisation and the role of the Department of Prevention of the Local Health Unit (APSS) of Trento (Trentino-Alto Adige Region, Northern Italy) against the spread of COVID-19 in the population, in the management of possible cases (with only clinical criteria of influenza-like illness, ILI, without diagnostic swab) reported by General practitioners (GPs) and by Family paediatricians (FPs) during the initial phase of the pandemic COVID-19 in Trentino-Alto Adige Region. DESIGN descriptive study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS this study analysed the reports of patients with ILI sent to the Healthcare company from 17 March to 17 April 2020 by their GPs or FP and subsequently classified into: redundant reports (people already known to the healthcare company as confirmed or probable case COVID-19); reports inconsistent with ILI criteria (patients not known to APSS as probable/confirmed case; without ILI criteria); appropriate reports (patients not known to APSS as probable/confirmed case; with ILI criteria). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES proportion of GPs and FPs who participated to report system reporting at least one patient, out of the total number of GPs and FPs; frequency of patients reported as ILI; time (in days) to manage reported patients. The cumulative weekly rate of ""non-redundant"" (not already known to APSS as probable/confirmed case) reports per thousand inhabitants was also calculated. RESULTS over 80% of GPs and FPs voluntary participated into the reporting system of patients with COVID-19 clinical criteria. Overall, 4,270 patients were reported; of these, 2,865 (67%) were not known to APSS as probable/confirmed case. Response time in days decrease progressively during the period of activity (from a mean of 6 days to 0.4 days during the 12th and 16th week of 2020, respectively). The cumulative weekly rate of client reports which were not already known as probable or confirmed cases (per 1,000 population) ranges from 3.54 to 6.84 cases in the 12th and 16th week, respectively. Among the 4,270 reports, 1,471 patients considered possible COVID-19 cases were identified due to the presence of ILI symptoms, even in the absence of a swab or a positive history for close contact with COVID-19 case. From the epidemiological investigation into the 1,471 possible cases, 2,514 close contacts were identified and quarantined at home. Of the 2,514 close contacts, 127 (5.05%) people developed symptoms during quarantine. CONCLUSIONS the integration among primary care, GPs and FPS, and the Department of Prevention could be an element of success in the management of the COVID-19 emergency and in the return to a normal phase. However, further assessments are required on the effectiveness and impact of the adopted model, especially in relation to the exit from phase 1 and phase 2 of the pandemic emergency.","Mantovani, William; Franchini, Silvia; Mazzurana, Mirko; Zuccali, Maria Grazi; Pizzo, Francesco; Zanin, Alessandra; Ferro, Antonio",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412800/,211
80593,Is the medical teacher's mental health neglected? Effects of perceived student attitudes and behaviors on mental health and lifestyle of teachers in a rural university of western Maharashtra in India.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND The clot burden score (CBS) was developed as a tool to evaluate the extent of intracranial thrombus burden in patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke. CBS is based on the presence or absence of contrast opacification on CT angiography (CTA). Its value in predicting radiographic and clinical outcomes in patients given endovascular stroke therapy remains unknown. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relationship between CBS and outcomes after stent retriever thrombectomy in the interventional arm of the SWIFT PRIME trial. METHODS CBS was calculated for the endovascular arm (IV tissue plasminogen activator plus Solitaire stent retriever) of SWIFT PRIME using baseline CTA. The cohort of 69 patients was divided into three groups according to their CBS values: CBS 0-5 (n=14), CBS 6-7 (n=23), and CBS 8-9 (n=32). RESULTS The mean age of the 69 patients who formed the study cohort was 63.2±13.1 years, mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16.8±4.5, and 55% of the patients were male. There was no difference in clinical characteristics among the three groups, except for the baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (p=0.049). The site of proximal occlusion varied significantly among the three groups (p<0.001). Rates of successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3), complete recanalization (TICI 3 only) and of good clinical outcome at 3 months were similar among the three groups (p=0.24, p=0.35, and p=0.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The combination of IV thrombolysis and stent retriever thrombectomy with the Solitaire device is highly effective in achieving successful recanalization and a good clinical outcome throughout the entire range of CBS values.","Mokin, Maxim; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Goyal, Mayank; Nogueira, Raul G; Yavagal, Dileep R; M Pereira, Vitor; Saver, Jeffrey L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634952/,211

New-onset AF is associated with increased mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Observational studies have identified several epidemiological and disease severity-related factors associated with developing new-onset AF on the ICU. However, there are limited data on the modifiable risk factors in the general adult ICU population.We describe a protocol for a systematic review of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for new-onset AF in the general adult ICU population. The results of this review will aid the development of risk prediction tools and inform future research into AF prevention on the ICU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database and the Cochrane Library, including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched for studies that assess the association of patient variables, investigation results, interventions and diagnoses associated with subsequent new-onset AF on the ICU.Only studies involving adult patients admitted to non-service-specific ICUs will be included. We will extract data relating to the statistical association between reversible and non-reversible factors and AF, the quality of the studies and the generalisability of the results. This systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This proposed systematic review will be based on published data, and therefore ethical approval is not required.

The need for anticholinergic adjuvants has also been clarified. Neuroapoptosis has been observed in animals and its implications for human subjects are discussed in a general context of neurotoxicity. The most important developments, however, are in the treatment of pain. Neurological and urological side effects strongly question long-term use. Other potentially beneficial effects have also been reported, such as anti-inflammatory and antidepressive effects. There are also indications that ketamine may attenuate postoperative delirium in coronary by-pass patients. SUMMARY More questions have arisen than have been answered.

BACKGROUND Endovenous ablation has replaced open surgery as the treatment of choice for truncal varicose veins. Timing of varicosity treatment is controversial with delayed and simultaneous pathways having studies advocating their benefits. A previous small randomized study has shown improved outcomes for simultaneous treatment. METHODS Patients undergoing local anesthetic endovenous thermal ablation were randomized to either simultaneous phlebectomy or delayed varicosity treatment. Patients were reviewed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year with clinical and quality of life scores completed, and were assessed at 6 weeks for need for further varicosity intervention, which was completed with either ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy or local anesthetic phlebectomy. Duplex ultrasound assessment of the treated trunk was completed at 6 months. RESULTS 101 patients were successfully recruited and treated out of 221 suitable patients from a screened population of 393. Patients in the simultaneous group (n = 51) showed a significantly improved Venous Clinical Severity Score at all time points, 36% of the delayed group required further treatment compared with 2% of the simultaneous group (P < 0.001). There were no deep vein thromboses, with 1 superfificial venous thrombosis in each group. CONCLUSIONS Combined endovenous ablation and phlebectomy delivers improved clinical outcomes and a reduced need for further procedures, as well as early quality of life improvements.","Lane, Tristan R A; Kelleher, Damian; Shepherd, Amanda C; Franklin, Ian J; Davies, Alun H",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000000790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24950277/,211
87872,A scoping review to characterize bridging tasks in the literature on aging with disability.,2020-03-04,"OBJECTIVE Because of its minimally invasive nature, percutaneous femoral access for endovascular aneurysm repair (pEVAR) is currently undergoing rapid popularization. Compared with surgical cutdown for femoral access (cEVAR), it offers the advantage of faster recovery after surgery as well as a reduction in wound complications. Despite proposed advantages, the method is largely considered uneconomical because of its reliance on costly closure devices. METHODS There were 50 patients undergoing EVAR who were enrolled in this randomized prospective single-center trial. Each patient randomly received percutaneous access in one groin and surgical access in the other. The primary end points were access duration and cost. Secondary end points were wound complications and the postoperative pain levels. RESULTS Surgery was performed per protocol in 44 patients. Mean access times for pEVAR and cEVAR were 11.5 ± 3.4 minutes and 24.8 ± 12.1 minutes (P < .001), respectively. Total access costs were €559.65 ± €112.69 for pEVAR and €674.85 ± €289.55 for cEVAR (P = .016). Eight complications in six patients were attributed to cutdown, none to pEVAR (P = .02). The percutaneously accessed groin was significantly less painful at day 1 and day 5 after surgery (P < .001). An intention-to-treat analysis (N = 50 patients) included six cases of pEVAR conversion due to technical failure in three patients (6%) and change of the operative strategy in another three patients (eg, aortouni-iliac stent graft followed by crossover bypass). The intention-to-treat analysis showed shorter mean overall access time for pEVAR (pEVAR, 14.65 ± 10.20 minutes; cEVAR, 25.12 ± 11.77 minutes; P < .001) and no cost difference between the two methods (pEVAR, €651.29 ± €313.49; cEVAR, €625.53 ± €238.29; P = .65). CONCLUSIONS Our data confirm proposed potential benefits attributable to the minimally invasive nature of pEVAR while demonstrating cost-effectiveness despite the additional cost of closure devices. Taking into account pEVAR failures still does not increase pEVAR costs over cEVAR. Further considering reduced postoperative pain and wound complications, the technique deserves consideration in suitable patients.","Uhlmann, Miriam Elisabeth; Walter, Corinna; Taher, Fadi; Plimon, Markus; Falkensammer, Jürgen; Assadian, Afshin",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2017.12.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29526378/,211
89211,"A systematic review exploring the content and outcomes of interventions to improve psychological safety, speaking up and voice behaviour.",2020-02-10,"UNLABELLED The roles of host genetics versus exposure and contact frequency in driving cross-species transmission remain the subject of debate. Here, we used a multitaxon lemur collection at the Saint Louis Zoo in the United States as a model to gain insight into viral transmission in a setting of high interspecies contact. Lemurs are a diverse and understudied group of primates that are highly endangered. The speciation of lemurs, which are endemic to the island of Madagascar, occurred in geographic isolation apart from that of continental African primates. Although evidence of endogenized viruses in lemur genomes exists, no exogenous viruses of lemurs have been described to date. Here we identified two novel picornaviruses in fecal specimens of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) and black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata). We found that the viruses were transmitted in a species-specific manner (lesavirus 1 was detected only in ring-tailed lemurs, while lesavirus 2 was detected only in black-and-white ruffed lemurs). Longitudinal sampling over a 1-year interval demonstrated ongoing infection in the collection. This was supported by evidence of viral clearance in some animals and new infections in previously uninfected animals, including a set of newly born triplets that acquired the infection. While the two virus strains were found to be cocirculating in a mixed-species exhibit of ring-tailed lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, and black lemurs, there was no evidence of cross-species transmission. This suggests that despite high-intensity contact, host species barriers can prevent cross-species transmissions of these viruses. IMPORTANCE Up to 75% of emerging infectious diseases in humans today are the result of zoonotic transmission. However, a challenge in understanding transmission dynamics has been the limited models of cross-species transmission. Zoos provide a unique opportunity to explore parameters defining viral transmission. We demonstrated that ongoing virus transmission in a mixed lemur species exhibit was species specific. This suggests that despite high contact intensity, host species barriers contribute to protection from cross-species transmission of these viruses. While the combinations of species might differ, most zoological parks worldwide commonly feature mixed-species exhibits. Collectively, this report demonstrates a widely applicable approach toward understanding infectious disease transmission.","Lim, Efrem S; Deem, Sharon L; Porton, Ingrid J; Cao, Song; Wang, David",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03342-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631076/,211
89589,Antibiotic use in the management of children with the common cold at a provincial hospital in Papua New Guinea: a point-prevalence study.,2018,"BACKGROUND Informal carers suffer from worse health outcomes than non-carers due to their caregiving role. Yet, in a society carers health is as important as that of their care recipients. This study investigated the self-assessed mental and general health outcomes of informal carers in Australia. It evaluated the influence of carers' personal social capital- a logically linked sequence of their social behaviour such as community participation, social support and trust in others- on their health outcomes. The study estimated the magnitude of small area level variation at Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) along with individual level variation in carers' health outcomes. METHODS The study used a multilevel mixed effects cross-sectional design using data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics of Australia survey, wave 14. It included Australians aged 15 years and older that were surveyed in the year 2014. The sample consisted of 12,767 individuals and 5004 SA1s. The outcome measures included- mental health, general health and physical functioning, domains of the Short Form 36 Questionnaire, a widely used multi-dimensional measure of health-related quality of life. RESULTS Informal carers suffered from poor mental (Beta = - 0.587, p = 0.003) and general health (Beta = - 0.670, p = 0.001) outcomes compared to non-carers in Australia. These health outcomes exhibited significant variation acrossSA1s in Australia, with 12-13% variation in general and mental health. However, within small local areas, differences at the individual level, accounted for most of the variation in outcomes. Moreover, levels of community participation, personal social connection and trust, as perceived by individuals in the communities, had a positive influence on both mental and general health of carers and non-carers, and were more beneficial for carers compared to non-carers. CONCLUSION It seems that the positive influence of social capital for carers helps them in coping with the negative impact of their caregiving duty on health outcomes. Findings suggested that some targeted community support programs for carers to build on their personal social cohesion and trust in their community could help in improving their poor health profiles. Moreover, improved informal carers' health may help the health system in better managing their resources.","Mohanty, Itismita; Niyonsenga, Theo; Cochrane, Tom; Rickwood, Debra",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09874-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243189/,211

A key gait parameter that is indicative of tripping is minimum foot clearance (MFC), which occurs during the mid-swing phase of gait. This is the second of a two-part scoping review on MFC literature. The aim of this paper is to identify vulnerable populations and conditions that impact MFC mean or median relative to controls. This information will inform future design/maintenance standards and outdoor built environment guidelines. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched to identify journal articles and conference papers that report level-ground MFC characteristics. Two independent reviewers screened papers for inclusion. Results: Out of 1571 papers, 43 relevant papers were included in this review. Twenty-eight conditions have been studied for effects on MFC. Eleven of the 28 conditions led to a decrease in mean or median MFC including dual-task walking in older adults, fallers with multiple sclerosis, and treadmill walking. All studies were conducted indoors. Conclusions: The lack of standardized research methods and covariates such as gait speed made it difficult to compare MFC values between studies for the purpose of defining design and maintenance standards for the outdoor built environment. Standardized methods for defining MFC and an emphasis on outdoor trials are needed in future studies.","Al Bochi, Abdulrahman; Delfi, Ghazaleh; Dutta, Tilak",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639597/,211

However, Black individuals living in countries where they are considered a minority population group (eg, in Northern America and Europe) are underrepresented in studies evaluating ADHD. Objective To estimate the pooled prevalence of ADHD and identify associated risk factors among US Black individuals. Data Sources This systematic review and meta-analysis identified peer-reviewed studies published until October 18, 2019, using the APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, ERIC, and Education Source databases. Study Selection Eligible trials were published in French or English, had empirical data on the prevalence of ADHD in samples or subsamples of Black people, and were conducted in countries with Black minority populations. All studies were assessed and passed quality evaluation. Data Extraction and Synthesis The PRISMA guideline was used for extracting and reporting data. Random-effects meta-analyses were generated to estimate the prevalence of ADHD among Black individuals using the metafor package in R. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence and risk factors associated with ADHD among Black individuals were identified. Results A total of 24 independent samples and subsamples from 21 studies published between 1979 and 2020 (154 818 Black participants) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. All included studies were conducted in the US. Two studies were conducted assessing adults (aged 18 years or older), 8 assessing children (0-12 years), 1 assessing adolescents (aged 13-17 years), and 13 assessing both children and adolescents. The pooled prevalence of ADHD was 14.54% (95% CI, 10.64%-19.56%). In a narrative review of the studies in this analysis, some studies found risk factors associated with ADHD, such as sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status), familial factors, environmental factors, and risk behaviors, but the data did not permit a moderation analysis to assess these findings in this study. Conclusions and Relevance Contrary to what is stated in the DSM-5, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that Black individuals are at higher risk for ADHD diagnoses than the general US population. These results highlight a need to increase ADHD assessment and monitoring among Black individuals from different social backgrounds. They also higlight the importance of establishing accurate diagnoses and culturally appropriate care.","Cénat, Jude Mary; Blais-Rochette, Camille; Morse, Catherine; Vandette, Marie-Pier; Noorishad, Pari-Gole; Kogan, Cary; Ndengeyingoma, Assumpta; Labelle, Patrick R",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.2788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902608/,211

Data were retrieved from the National Hip Fracture Database and electronic medical records. Data was collected for the strictest UK lockdown period (period B=23 March 2020-11 May 2020), and the corresponding period in 2019 (period A). RESULTS A total of 386 patients were admitted during period A, whereas 381 were admitted during period B. Despite the suspension of the 'Best Practice Tariff' during period B, time to surgery, time to orthogeriatric assessment, and 30-day mortality were similar between period A and B. The length of inpatient stay was significantly shorter during period B (11.5 days vs 17.0 days, p<0.001). Comparison of COVID-19 positive and negative patients during period B demonstrated that a positive test was associated with a significantly higher rate of 30-day mortality (53.6% vs 6.7%), surgical delay >36h (46.4% vs 30.8%, p=0.049), and increased length of inpatient stay (15.8 vs 11.7 days, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown did not alter the epidemiology of hip fractures. A substantially higher mortality rate was observed among patients with a COVID-19 positive test. These findings should be taken into consideration by the healthcare policymakers while formulating contingency plans for a potential 'second wave'.","Malik-Tabassum, K; Robertson, A; Tadros, B J; Chan, G; Crooks, M; Buckle, C; Rogers, B; Selmon, G; Arealis, G",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715420/,211
95975,Realizing the Promise of Learning Organizations to Transform Mental Health Care: Telepsychiatry Care As an Exemplar.,2020-08-12,"Incorporating nanotechnology into fluorescent imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown promising potentials for accurate diagnosis of cancer at earlier stage than the conventional imaging modalities. Molecular imaging (MI) aims to quantitatively characterize, visualize, and measure the biological processes or living cells at molecular and genetic levels. MI modalities have been exploited in different applications including noninvasive determination and visualization of diseased tissues, cell trafficking visualization, early detection, treatment response monitoring, and in vivo visualization of living cells. High affinity molecular probe and imaging modality to detect the probe are the two main requirements of MI. Recent advances in nanotechnology and allied modalities, have facilitated the use of nanoparticles (NPs) as MI probes. Within the extensive group of NPs, fluorescent NPs play a prominent role in optical molecular imaging. The fluorescent NPs used in molecular and cellular imaging can be categorized into three main groups including quantum dots (QDs), upconversion, and dye-doped NPs. Fluorescent NPs have great potentials in targeted theranostics including cancer imaging, immunoassay based cells, proteins and bacteria detections, imaging-guided surgery and therapy. Fluorescent NPs have shown promising potentials for drug and gene delivery, detection of the chromosomal abnormalities, labeling of DNA, and visualizing DNA replication dynamics. Multifunctional NPs have been successfully used in a single theranostic modality integrating diagnosis and therapy. The unique characteristics of multifunctional NPs make them potential theranostic agents that can be utilized concurrently for diagnosis and therapy. This review provides state of the art of the nanotechnological applications for early cancer diagnosis focusing on fluorescent NPs, their synthesis methods and perspectives in clinical theranostics.","Jin, Ke-Tao; Yao, Jia-Yu; Ying, Xiao-Jiang; Lin, Yan; Chen, Yun-Fang",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/1568026620666200922112640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962614/,211

DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional study PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six (56) subjects (112 eyes) with a diagnosis of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect METHODS: The three-dimensional shape of the eyeball on 3D-MRI scans was classified according to the dimension of the longest diameter: axial dimension (prolate sphere), group 1; horizontal dimension (horizontally oblate sphere), group 2; and vertical dimension (vertically oblate sphere), group 3. The deviation of the CRVT, as a surrogate of lamina cribrosa (LC) shift, was measured from the center of the Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) demarcated by OCT imaging, with the horizontal midline as 0° and the superior location as a positive value. The angular location of the longest EOB was also measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Positions of CRVT and EOB according to the three-dimensional shape of an eyeball RESULTS: Among 112 eyes, 54 (48%) had a prolate shape (group 1), 23 (21%) a horizontally oblate shape (group 2), and 35 (31%) a vertically oblate shape (group 3). The angular deviation of the CRVT differed among the groups: to the nasal side in group 1, to the temporal side in group 2, and along the vertical meridian in group 3. In cases of asymmetric eyeball shape, the CRVT was deviated toward the undergrown side from the overgrown side, regardless of grouping. The angular location of the longest EOB was in the direction opposite to the CRVT position (P < 0.001). A generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that the temporal location of the CRVT was associated with older age (P = 0.001), nasal location of the longest EOB (P < 0.001), and oblate shape of the eyeball (P <0.001, group 2; P = 0.007, group 3). CONCLUSIONS The position of the CRVT and EOB were associated with the three-dimensional eyeball shape. Considering that infant ONH morphology is highly uniform, various modes of eyeball expansion during growth can result in diverse directionalities of offset between the LC and BMO in adults.","Lee, Kyoung Min; Park, Sun-Won; Kim, Martha; Oh, Sohee; Kim, Seok Hwan",Ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ophtha.2020.08.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916169/,211

100443,Mental Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic among US Adults without a Pre-existing Mental Health Condition: Findings from American Trend Panel Survey.,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND The standard of care for clinically node-negative (cN0) patients following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was completion axillary lymph node dissection (CALND). Publication of ACOSOG Z0011 in 2010 changed this standard for patients undergoing lumpectomy. Clinicians have since expanded this practice to mastectomy patients, and ongoing prospective studies are seeking to validate this practice. Here, we evaluate patient and tumor characteristics that led surgeons to forego a second surgery for CALND in cN0 mastectomy patients with positive SLNB. PATIENTS AND METHODS A single institution, retrospective review of cN0 patients with invasive primary breast cancer and positive SLNB from 2010 to 2016 was performed. Patients with T4 disease, positive preoperative axillary biopsy, prior neoadjuvant therapy or axillary surgery were excluded. Patients with positive SLNB undergoing CALND were compared with patients for whom CALND was omitted. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests or Fischer exact tests for categorical variables. RESULTS Of 259 patients with positive SLNB, 180 (69.4%) patients underwent mastectomy. CALND was performed at the time of mastectomy in 54 (30%) patients, at time of second operation in 22 (12.2%) patients, and not performed in 104 (57%) patients. Delayed CALND was significantly associated with younger age, larger tumors, increased number of positive sentinel nodes, invasive lobular carcinoma, extranodal extension, and lymphovascular invasion. CONCLUSIONS The management of cN0 patients with positive SLNB that do not meet ACOSOG Z0011 criteria is evolving and is influenced by tumor and patient characteristics in an attempt to balance the morbidity of CALND with the low rate of local regional recurrence.","Mathias, Brittany J; Sun, James; Sun, Weihong; Zhou, Jun-Min; Fulp, William J; Laronga, Christine; Lee, M Catherine; Kiluk, John V",Clinical breast cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.07.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917535/,211

The aim of the study was to assess FLER's performances in evaluating perfusion in an animal model of long-lasting intestinal ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS An ischemic segment was created in 18 small bowel loops in 6 pigs. After 2 h (n = 6), 4 h (n = 6), and 6 h (n = 6), loops were evaluated clinically and by FLER to delineate five regions of interest (ROIs): ischemic zone (ROI 1), presumed viable margins (ROI 2a-2b), and vascularized areas (3a-3b). Capillary lactates were measured to compare clinical vs. FLER assessment. Basal (V 0 ) and maximal (V max) mitochondrial respiration rates were determined according to FLER. RESULTS Lactates (mmol/L) at clinically identified resection lines were significantly higher when compared to those identified by FLER (2.43 ± 0.95 vs. 1.55 ± 0.33 p = 0.02) after 4 h of ischemia. Lactates at 2 h at ROI 1 were 5.45 ± 2.44 vs. 1.9 ± 0.6 (2a-2b; p < 0.0001) vs. 1.2 ± 0.3 (3a-3b; p < 0.0001). At 4 h, lactates were 4.36 ± 1.32 (ROI 1) vs. 1.83 ± 0.81 (2a-2b; p < 0.0001) vs. 1.35 ± 0.67 (3a-3b; p < 0.0001). At 6 h, lactates were 4.16 ± 2.55 vs. 1.8 ± 1.2 vs. 1.45 ± 0.83 at ROI 1 vs. 2a--2b (p = 0.013) vs. 3a-3b (p = 0.0035). Mean V 0 and V max (pmolO2/second/mg of tissue) were significantly impaired after 4 and 6 h at ROI 1 (V 0 (4h) = 34.83 ± 10.39; V max (4h) = 76.6 ± 29.09; V 0 (6h) = 44.1 ± 12.37 and V max (6h) = 116.1 ± 40.1) when compared to 2a--2b (V 0 (4h) = 67.1 ± 17.47 p = 0.00039; V max (4h) = 146.8 ± 55.47 p = 0.0054; V 0 (6h) = 63.9 ± 28.99 p = 0.03; V max (6h) = 167.2 ± 56.96 p = 0.01). V 0 and V max were significantly higher at 3a-3b.

METHODS A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured dyadic interviews with 13 couples (N = 26) carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality. All couples had an informative consultation in our PGT centre in the Netherlands. RESULTS Almost all couples considered PGT or natural conception combined with prenatal diagnosis (PND) as the only two reproductive options. Among several considerations mentioned, the majority indicated that the wish to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy was the most important motive to opt for PGT. All couples who opted for PGT had first tried to conceive spontaneously and entered the PGT programme because of their adverse experiences during these attempts (infertility, recurrent miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, birth of an affected child). Couples that refrained from PGT were of advanced maternal age and expressed the long trajectory of PGT as the main reason to refrain. If conceiving spontaneously would not lead to an ongoing pregnancy, these couples also indicated that they would use PGT. CONCLUSION This study shows that couples carrying a structural chromosomal abnormality consider PGT and spontaneous conception with PND as relevant reproductive options. They are looking for the option that is in their opinion the fastest way to establish a successful pregnancy. Information on the perceived pros and cons of PGT or spontaneous conception in these couples can help to optimize counselling and psychological support during the decision-making process.","De Krom, G; Severijns, Y; Vlieg, W L; Arens, Y H J M; Van Golde, R J T; De Die-Smulders, C E M; Van Osch, L A D M",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-020-01810-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418135/,211

This qualitative study aims to contribute to the existing field through exploring the contribution that creativity, in the form of active participation in the arts, can make upon the older person's transition to retirement. METHODS A total of 15 recently retired people in a Scottish town were invited to participate in a qualitative project which explored, using the creative arts, the participants' psychological and social experiences during this period of transition. The emphasis was on participants' active, rather than passive, involvement in different art modalities. An action research methodology was adopted, involving a circular flexible design. Qualitative information was generated through focus groups, participant observations and group discussions with participants attending arts workshops. Participants were also invited to record their thoughts and observations anonymously in written form. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Two co-researchers, who were recently retired people from outside the community, took part as participant observers. RESULTS Key findings indicated that the need to feel challenged and stimulated was paramount for feelings of wellbeing. The feeling of belonging to a community was considered important and could be derived from creative arts activities. Psychological and social benefits of arts participation were derived from active participation, primarily in creating original work. CONCLUSION Participants had disparate experience of arts but were united in their search for creative fulfilment.

111699,The Near-Term Future of Health Care Reform.,2021-04-13,"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has gained broad acceptance among pediatric surgeons. Today, VATS can be regarded as a routine approach for various conditions in neonates and infants. However, there is a lack of information concerning the complications of thoracoscopic pulmonary surgery in neonates and infants. We aimed to review the available data. A systematic review of the literature was performed using PubMed. All publications reporting on VATS for pulmonary procedures in neonates and infants up to the age of 1 year were included. Articles were reviewed in detail for occurrence of perioperative complications and their treatment. Nine case series were eligible for analysis. Entities treated included lung sequestration, congenital pulmonary airway malformation, congenital lobar emphysema, and bronchogenic cyst. Case series reported on a total number of 135 patients. Complications occurred in 14 patients (10.4%). The major complication was an accidental transection of the middle lobar bronchus that concluded in a later resection of a prior unaffected lung lobe. Other relevant complications reported were bleeding in four patients (3.0%) and persistent air leak in four cases (3.0%). Infectious complications were reported in four patients (3.0%). Additionally, iatrogenic phrenic nerve paralysis occurred in one patient. There were no deaths related to the VATS technique. In 11 cases (8.1%), conversion to thoracotomy had been necessary. General recommendations on the treatment of complications could not be derived due to small patient numbers and lack of details of the complications reported. Reports on major complications of pulmonary VATS in neonates and infants below 1 year of age are scarce. As severe complications such as accidental bronchus transection have been described, feasibility of neonatal/infant VATS cannot be unequivocally confirmed. No literature-based recommendation can be given on the treatment of complications.","Zoeller, Christoph; Ure, Benno M; Dingemann, Jens",European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

112342,Reducing Administrative Waste in the US Health Care System.,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND Neuropathic pain is a condition resulting from injury to the peripheral and/or central nervous system. Despite extensive research over the last several decades, neuropathic pain remains difficult to manage. METHODS The authors conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and crossover clinical trial to examine the effect of 1.5% topical diclofenac (TD) on neuropathic pain. The authors hypothesized that 1.5% TD would reduce the visual pain score and improve both quantitative sensory testing and functional status in subjects with neuropathic pain. The authors recruited subjects with postherpetic neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome. The primary outcome was subject's visual pain score. RESULTS Twenty-eight subjects completed the study (12 male and 16 female) with the mean age of 48.8 yr. After 2 weeks of topical application, subjects in 1.5% TD group showed lower overall visual pain score compared with placebo group (4.9 [1.9] vs. 5.6 [2.1], difference: 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.3; P = 0.04) as well as decreased burning pain (2.9 [2.6] vs. 4.3 [2.8], difference, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.6; P = 0.01). There were no statistical differences in constant pain, shooting pain, or hypersensitivity over the painful area between the groups. This self-reported improvement of pain was corroborated by the decreased pain summation detected by quantitative sensory testing. There were no statistically significant changes in functional status in these subjects. There were no complications in both groups. CONCLUSION The findings indicate that 1.5% TD may serve as an effective treatment option for patients with neuropathic pain from postherpetic neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome.","Ahmed, Shihab U; Zhang, Yi; Chen, Lucy; Cohen, Abigail; St Hillary, Kristin; Vo, Trang; Houghton, Mary; Mao, Jianren",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25955980/,211
113513,Using human centered design to identify opportunities for reducing inequities in perinatal care.,2021-07-20,"The persistence of the coronavirus-caused respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the related restrictions to mobility and social interactions are forcing a significant portion of students and workers to reorganize their daily activities to accommodate the needs of distance learning and agile work (smart working). What is the impact of these changes on the bosses/teachers' and workers/students' experience? This article uses recent neuroscience research findings to explore how distance learning and smart working impact the following three pillars that reflect the organization of our brain and are at the core of school and office experiences: (a) the learning/work happens in a dedicated physical place; (b) the learning/work is carried out under the supervision of a boss/professor; and (c) the learning/work is distributed between team members/classmates. For each pillar, we discuss its link with the specific cognitive processes involved and the impact that technology has on their functioning. In particular, the use of videoconferencing affects the functioning of Global Positioning System neurons (neurons that code our navigation behavior), mirror neurons, self-attention networks, spindle cells, and interbrain neural oscillations. These effects have a significant impact on many identity and cognitive processes, including social and professional identity, leadership, intuition, mentoring, and creativity. In conclusion, just moving typical office and learning processes inside a videoconferencing platform, as happened in many contexts during the COVID-19 pandemic, can in the long term erode corporate cultures and school communities. In this view, an effective use of technology requires us to reimagine how work and teaching are done virtually, in creative and bold new ways.","Riva, Giuseppe; Wiederhold, Brenda K; Mantovani, Fabrizia","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577414/,211

METHODS An epidemiological investigation looked at two patients who shared a hospital ward in February 2015, in Quzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Samples from the patients, close contacts, and local environments were examined by real time reverse transcriptase (rRT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture. Haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation assays were used to detect specific antibodies to the viruses. Primary outcomes were clinical data, infection source tracing, phylogenetic tree analysis, and serological results. STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS A 49 year old man (index patient) became ill seven days after visiting a live poultry market. A 57 year old man (second patient), with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, developed influenza-like symptoms after sharing the same hospital ward as the index patient for five days. The second patient had not visited any poultry markets nor had any contact with poultry or birds within 15 days before the onset of illness. H7N9 virus was identified in the two patients, who both later died. Genome sequences of the virus isolated from both patients were nearly identical, and genetically similar to the virus isolated from the live poultry market. No specific antibodies were detected among 38 close contacts. Transmission between the patients remains unclear, owing to the lack of samples collected from their shared hospital ward. Although several environmental swabs were positive for H7N9 by rRT-PCR, no virus was cultured. Owing to delayed diagnosis and frequent hospital transfers, no serum samples were collected from the patients, and antibodies to H7N9 viruses could not be tested. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Nosocomial H7N9 transmission might be possible between two unrelated individuals. Surveillance on patients with influenza-like illness in hospitals as well as chickens in live poultry markets should be enhanced to monitor transmissibility and pathogenicity of the virus.

114395,Reliability of Portable Spirometry Performed in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Compared to Conventional Spirometry.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND Acute normovolemic hemodilution is recommended as a technique to reduce allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in cardiac surgery, but its efficacy to reduce non-RBC transfusion has not been consistently demonstrated. We hypothesized that intraoperative large-volume autologous whole blood (AWB) collection and reinfusion improves viscoelastic coagulation parameters. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Prospective observational study of cardiac surgery patients at the University of Maryland Medical Center between December 2017 and August 2019. Rotational thromboelastometry parameters were compared between AWB and control groups (n = 25 in each group) at three time points: T1, baseline; T2, on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after the cross-clamp removal; and T3, 30-60 minutes after protamine administration. The study's primary outcomes were whole blood viscoelastic coagulation parameters that included EXTEM clotting time (CT), FIBTEM amplitude at 10 minutes, and EXTEM amplitude at 10 minutes (EXTEM-A10 ). Chest tube drainage and allogeneic transfusion were secondary outcomes. RESULTS Reinfusion of AWB after CPB resulted in a significantly shorter EXTEM CT; mean difference, -11.4 seconds (-21.4 to -1.4; P = .03). It also resulted in a greater percentage increase in EXTEM A10 from T2 to T3; mean difference, 7.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-14.5%; P = .02). Statistical significance was not found in 24-hour chest tube drainage. CONCLUSION Large-volume AWB collection and reinfusion are feasible in selected cardiac surgical patients, and may be associated with prohemostatic effects according to thromboelastometry, warranting further investigation with a prospective randomized study.","Henderson, Reney A; Judd, Miranda; Strauss, Erik R; Gammie, James S; Mazzeffi, Michael A; Taylor, Bradley S; Tanaka, Kenichi A",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423288/,211

MATERIAL AND METHODS The procedure was carried out on ten pigs. Two gastroscopes were introduced through the mouth and through a 12 mm trocar, respectively. A mechanical circular gastro-jejunal anastomosis was created by introducing a stapler after the trocar incision was enlarged. A 21 mm EEA OrVil circular stapler was utilized in the first six pigs and a 25 mm one was used in the other four. All pigs were fed beginning 24 hours after the procedure and were euthanized three weeks later. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed in all ten animals. The mean length of the skin incision was 2.5 cm. All pigs survived without complications. Endoscopic inspection detected anastomotic strictures in 5/6 of the 21 mm-stapler and in 0/4 of the 25 mm-stapler anastomoses (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal bypass using a hybrid NOTES-single 12 mm trocar access technique is a simple and safe procedure in a survival porcine model. Functional results need to be evaluated by further studies.","Polese, Lino; Porzionato, Andrea; Luisetto, Roberto; Mastrogiacomo, Doralba; Macchi, Veronica; De Caro, Raffaele; Norberto, Lorenzo; Merigliano, Stefano",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2015.1125929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26751102/,211
115356,Screen time and extracurricular activities as risk and protective factors for mental health in adolescence: A population-level study.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND A social mobilization (SM) initiative contributed to India's success in polio elimination. This was the CORE Group Polio Project (CGPP) India, a partner of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) SM Network and which continued its SM activities, even during the polio-free period through a network of multi-level social mobilizers. This paper assesses the effects of this community-level SM (CLSM) intervention on the extent of community engagement and performance of polio Supplementary Immunization Activity campaigns (SIAs) during the post-polio-endemic period (i.e., from March 2012 to September 2017). METHODS This study followed a quasi-experimental design. We used secondary, cluster-level data from CGPP India's Management Information System, including 52 SIAs held from January 2008 to September 2017, covering 56 blocks from 12 districts of UP. We computed various indicators and performed Generalized Estimating Equations based analysis to assess the statistical significance of differences between the outcomes of intervention and non-intervention areas. We then estimated the effects of the SM intervention using Interrupted time-series, Difference-in-Differences and Synthetic Control Methods. Finally, we estimated the population influenced by the intervention. RESULTS The performance of polio SIAs changed over time, with the intervention areas having better outcomes than non-intervention areas. The absence of CLSM intervention during the post-polio-endemic period would have negatively impacted the outcomes of polio SIAs. The percentage of children vaccinated at polio SIA booths, percentage of 'X' houses (i.e., households with unvaccinated children or households with out-of-home/out-of-village children or locked households) converted to 'P' (i.e., households with all vaccinated children or households without children eligible for vaccination), and percentage of resistant houses converted to polio acceptors would have gone down by 14.1 (Range: 12.7 to 15.5), 6.3 (Range: 5.2 to 7.3) and 7.4 percentage points, respectively. Community engagement would have reduced by 7.2 (Range: 6.6 to 7.7) percentage points. CONCLUSIONS The absence of CLSM intervention would have significantly decreased the level of community engagement and negatively impacted the performance of polio SIAs of the post-polio-endemic period. The study provides evidence of an added value of deploying additional human resource dedicated to social mobilization to achieve desired vaccination outcomes in hard-to-reach or programmatically challenging areas.","Choudhary, Manojkumar; Solomon, Roma; Awale, Jitendra; Dey, Rina; Singh, Jagajeet Prasad; Weiss, William",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11425-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246239/,211
116679,Perceptions of Workplace Violence and Workplace Stress: A Mixed Methods Study of Trauma among Psychiatric Workers.,2021-04-09,"Background New dressings purport to reduce surgical wound complications after total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study compared delayed wound healing rates and reoperations between 2 increasingly popular dressings: a silver-impregnated occlusive (standard) dressing and a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive with polyester mesh. Methods This retrospective cohort study reviewed 431 consecutive THAs performed by 2 surgeons between January 2017 and May 2019. One hundred and eight were excluded for not using standard or mesh dressings. A final 323 cases were separated into 2 cohorts: mesh (n = 186) and standard dressings (n = 137). Standard dressings were removed at 1 week. Mesh persisted until nonadherent, approximately 3-4 weeks. The surgeon assessed delayed wound healing at the 2-week postoperative visit. Secondary outcomes include deep infection and return to the operating room for a wound-related diagnosis. Differences were determined using the chi-square test. Results There were no demographic, comorbidity, or surgical differences between groups. There were 22 total cases of delayed wound healing with 7 (3.8%) in the mesh group and 15 (10.9%) in the standard dressing group (P = .01). There were no significant differences in reoperations (2 [1.1%] vs 2 [1.5%], P = .76) or deep infections (2 [1.1%] vs 1 [0.7%], P = .75). Conclusions Mesh dressings are a safe and reliable dressing type for THA and were associated with a decrease in early wound healing complications when compared with standard, silver-impregnated occlusive dressings in this retrospective series. The mesh tension sharing properties and longer duration of occlusive protection may explain this difference.

118015,Work-related Mental Consequences: Implications of Burnout on Mental Health Status Among Health Care Providers.,2015,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a highly lethal pneumonia that emerged in 2012. There is limited information on MERS-CoV pathogenesis, as data from patients are scarce and the generation of animal models reproducing MERS clinical manifestations has been challenging. Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice and a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERSMA-6-1-2) were recently described. hDPP4-KI mice infected with MERSMA-6-1-2 show pathological signs of respiratory disease, high viral titers in the lung, and death. In this work, a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV infectious cDNA was engineered by introducing non-synonymous mutations contained in the MERSMA-6-1-2 genome into a MERS-CoV infectious cDNA, leading to a recombinant mouse-adapted virus (rMERS-MA) that was virulent in hDDP4-KI mice. MERS-CoV adaptation to cell culture or mouse lungs led to mutations and deletions in genus-specific gene 5 that prevented full-length protein expression. In contrast, analysis of 476 MERS-CoV field isolates showed that gene 5 is highly stable in vivo, both in humans and camels. To study the role of protein 5, two additional viruses were engineered expressing a full-length gene 5 (rMERS-MA-5FL), or containing a complete gene 5 deletion (rMERS-MA-Δ5). rMERS-MA-5FL virus was unstable, as deletions appeared during passage in different tissue culture cells, highlighting MERS-CoV instability. The virulence of rMERS-MA-Δ5 was analyzed in a sublethal hDPP4-KI mouse model. Unexpectedly, all mice died after infection with rMERS-MA-Δ5 in contrast to those infected with the parental virus, which contains a 17-nt deletion and a stop codon in protein 5 at position 108. Interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was delayed and dysregulated in the lungs of rMERS-MA-Δ5 infected mice. Overall, these data indicated that rMERS-MA-Δ5 virus was more virulent than the parental one and suggest that the residual gene 5 sequence present in the mouse-adapted parental virus had a function in ameliorating severe MERS-CoV pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus causing human infections with high mortality rate (∼35%). Animal models together with reverse genetics systems are essential to understand MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We developed a reverse genetics system for a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that reproduces the virus behavior observed in humans. This system is highly useful to investigate the role of specific viral genes in pathogenesis. In addition, we described a virus lacking gene 5 expression that is more virulent than the parental one. The data provide novel functions in IFN modulation for gene 5 in the context of viral infection, and will help to develop novel antiviral strategies.","Gutierrez-Alvarez, Javier; Wang, Li; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Li, Kun; McCray, Paul B; Perlman, Stanley; Sola, Isabel; Zuñiga, Sonia; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01172-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144319/,211

An ethnographic study of the challenges and potentials of involving relatives in the acute ambulatory clinical pathway.,2020-11-26,"As COVID-19 converges with loneliness and addiction epidemics in the US, both public health and mental health experts forecast dramatic increases in substance use and mental health conditions. This cross-sectional study evaluated relationships of loneliness with depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and drug use during COVID-19, and assessed perceived increases in these symptoms in young adults. Between April 22 and May 11, 2020, 1,008 participants ages 18-35 were recruited through social media to a one-time, online anonymous survey. Symptomatology was assessed using six scales. Perceived changes since COVID-19 were evaluated using 5-point Likert scales. Forty-nine percent of respondents reported loneliness scores above 50; 80% reported significant depressive symptoms; 61% reported moderate to severe anxiety; 30% disclosed harmful levels of drinking. While only 22% of the population reported using drugs, 38% reported severe drug use. Loneliness was associated with higher levels of mental health symptomatology. Participants reported significant increases across mental health and substance use symptoms since COVID-19. While direct impacts of COVID-19 could only be calculated with pre-pandemic assessments of these symptoms, estimates indicate elevated psychosocial symptomatology and suggest that symptoms could have worsened since the pandemic. Findings underscore the importance of prevention and intervention to address these public health problems.","Horigian, Viviana E; Schmidt, Renae D; Feaster, Daniel J",Journal of psychoactive drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2020.1836435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111650/,211

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility, embolization characteristics, and embolization extent with a newly developed extra-small micro-balloon catheter in an in vivo and in an in vitro embolization model in comparison with standard microcatheter embolizations. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-eight embolization procedures were performed in the porcine rete mirabile (RM) and in an in vitro embolization model, using either an extra-small (distal outer diameter 1.6 F) dual-lumen micro-balloon catheter or a standard microcatheter. Precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid (PHIL) was used as embolic agent. Procedure times, number of injections, required volume of embolic agent, and embolization extent (percentage of embolized RM in postinterventional X-ray scans or number of filled sections of the in vitro model) were assessed. Histopathological analyses were performed. RESULTS Total procedure time was significantly shorter (in vivo: 123 s vs 615 s (medians), P=0.001; in vitro: 180 s vs 496 s (medians), P=0.001), number of reflux events was significantly lower (in vivo: 0 vs 9 (medians), P=0.001; in vitro: 0 vs 3 (medians), P=0.001), and embolization extent was significantly higher (in vivo: 96.9% vs 65.6% (medians), P=0.011; in vitro: 26 vs 18 filled sections (medians); P=0.041) for the micro-balloon catheter groups. There was antegrade movement of the PHIL cast after balloon deflation in one in vitro embolization procedure and spontaneous balloon deflation with subsequent reflux in one in vivo embolization procedure. CONCLUSION Extra-small dual-lumen micro-balloon catheters can improve endovascular embolization in comparison with standard microcatheter embolization.","Vollherbst, Dominik F; Otto, Ruth; Do, Thuy D; von Deimling, Andreas; Kauczor, Hans U; Bendszus, Martin; Sommer, Christof M; Möhlenbruch, Markus A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-013752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29555871/,211

MATERIALS AND METHODS 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.","Lorentzen, T; Skjoldbye, B O; Nolsoe, C P",Ultraschall in der Medizin,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0029-1246002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21259183/,211

Here, we show that TET2 deficiency leads to DNA hypermethylation of regulatory elements in GC B cells, associated with silencing of the respective genes. This hypermethylation affects the binding of transcription factors including those involved in exit from the GC reaction and involves pathways such as B cell receptor, antigen presentation, CD40, and others. Normal GC B cells manifest a typical hypomethylation signature, which is caused by AID, the enzyme that mediates somatic hypermutation. However, AID-induced demethylation is markedly impaired in TET2-deficient GC B cells, suggesting that AID epigenetic effects are partially dependent on TET2. Last, we find that TET2 mutant DLBCLs also manifest the aberrant TET2-deficient GC DNA methylation signature, suggesting that this epigenetic pattern is maintained during and contributes to lymphomagenesis.","Rosikiewicz, Wojciech; Chen, Xiaowen; Dominguez, Pilar M; Ghamlouch, Hussein; Aoufouchi, Said; Bernard, Olivier A; Melnick, Ari; Li, Sheng",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay5872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596441/,211

However, these instruments are not specifically designed for facial signs. OBJECTIVES To develop and validate a specific questionnaire to assess the burden on patients with facial signs of systemic sclerosis and which we have named ""Burden of Face Affected"" (BoFA). METHODS BoFA was developed using standard methodology in 3 phases: exploration, development and validation. In all, 197 patients completed questionnaires. We analysed the degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's α) and external validity between BoFA and the 12-Item Short Form Healthy Survey (SF-12), the Mouth Handicap In Systemic Sclerosis Scale (MHISS), Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). To assess reproducibility, a test-retest analysis was conducted. The original French version was translated into English and underwent cultural validation. RESULTS The questionnaire comprises 20 items grouped into 4 dimensions. BoFA showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α: 0.93). External validity was demonstrated in terms of good correlation between BoFA and other questionnaires, in particular MHISS (r=0.54). The test-retest analysis demonstrated good reproducibility (0.92). The BoFA score varied significantly according to the severity of facial scleroderma as assessed by the patients themselves. DISCUSSION Facial involvement in systemic sclerosis may be considered by physicians to be a minor consequence of the disease and is often overlooked. Nevertheless, it is crucial for patients' quality of life. A number of studies have assessed the impact of facial signs on health-related quality of life using instruments such as DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index), SWAP (Satisfaction With Appearance Scale), Brief SWAP and SSPRO (Scleroderma Skin Patient-Reported Outcome). However, these are not specific for facial signs and focus on other sites. BoFA has good reliability and construct validity, and it assesses disability specifically involving the face in patients with systemic sclerosis. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, BoFA is the first specific tool for assessing burden in patients with facial scleroderma. It is an easy-to-use tool for evaluating the burden of facial signs and may also be used to assess the degree of burden before and after treatment.","Doutre, M-S; Godard, D; Benani, M; Taieb, C",Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annder.2020.04.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709366/,211

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke onset in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 25 consecutive patients with acute basilar artery occlusion who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy by use of the Solitaire stent within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset. Successful recanalization was defined as TICI grade 2b or 3. Good outcome was defined as mRS score of 0-2 at 3 months. Clinical and radiologic data in patients with good outcomes were compared with those with poor outcomes. RESULTS Successful recanalization was achieved in 96% (24/25) of patients, and 48% (12/25) of patients had good outcomes. Eighty-eight percent (22/25) of patients survived to 3 months. The median NIHSS score on admission was significantly lower in patients with good outcomes than in those with poor outcomes (9.5 versus 14, P = .005). Procedure-related complications occurred in 2 patients (8%). No symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages occurred.

121598,"Positive impacts of a dedicated General Paediatrics ""home"" ward in a tertiary paediatric Australian hospital.",2020-12-15,"Introduction Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common complex entity that has emerged as a worldwide epidemic and major public health concern. The incidence of MetS often parallels the incidence of obesity and it is even worst among people living with comorbidities like; HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and mental illness. Therefore, there was an urgent need to summarize the extent and risk factors of MetS in Ethiopia. Methodology This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guideline to investigate the prevalence of MetS and contributing factors. English language-based databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) were exhaustively searched to identify studies related to the prevalence of MetS. A random-effects model was employed to estimate the pooled prevalence of MetS, and it was computed using STATA 16.0 software. Heterogeneity analysis was reported using I2. Result A total of 25 studies with 21,431 study participants were included for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MetS was 30.0% (95% CI: 24.0-36.0%, I2 = 99.19%, p < 0.001) with a high degree of heterogeneity across studies. Subgroup analysis with the target population showed that metabolic syndrome was most prevalent among type II diabetic 56% (95% CI: 47 - 64) and hypertensive patients 44% (95% CI: 35 - 53). Increased age, female gender, being overweight and obese, having a high educational level and income, physical inactivity, and being on treatment of chronic diseases like, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and HIV/AIDS were the most frequently reported risk factors of MetS regardless of the study population.

123090,Present as a partner and a parent: Mothers' and fathers' perspectives on father participation in prenatal care.,2021-05-05,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) presents with symptoms of aural fullness and pressure, muffled hearing, tinnitus, and otalgia. When severe, it can lead to many common ear disorders such as otitis media with effusion, tympanic membrane retraction/perforation, and cholesteatoma. These diseases are prevalent in both the pediatric and adult population and significantly impact quality of life. The pathophysiology of ETD in the absence of an obstructive lesion has long been debated but is thought to be related to functional obstruction (i.e., inefficient tensor veli palatini muscle) and/or nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal inflammation. In the acute setting, the most common cause of nasal inflammation is an upper respiratory infection. When symptoms become chronic, however, the inflammation is thought to be associated with nasal irritants such as nasal allergens, i.e., allergic rhinitis (AR). The purpose of this review is to summarize our current understanding of the relationship between allergy and ETD. RECENT FINDINGS Past studies are either lacking or have reported equivocal findings regarding the relationship between allergy and ETD, and the 2018 International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Allergic Rhinitis has deemed the current level of evidence linking AR and ETD as low quality. A more recent study using a large adult population dataset did support an association between AR and ETD, but did not find that all cases of ETD are related to allergies. Furthermore, current evidence suggests that the use of medications that can decrease intranasal inflammation, such as intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines, does not result in significant symptomatic improvement in patients with ETD. However, these studies included all patients with ETD, and evidence is lacking regarding the treatment effect of these medications on the subset of patients with concurrent AR and ETD. Current best evidence does support an association between AR and ETD; however, not all patients with ETD suffer from AR, and vice versa. Further research is necessary to understand the mechanism behind this positive association and to elucidate the cause of chronic ETD in patients without associated allergies.","Juszczak, Hailey M; Loftus, Patricia A",Current allergy and asthma reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11882-020-00951-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648122/,211

DESIGN A narrative review was performed. DATA SOURCES A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted on both Chinese and English electronic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, PsycINFO. Articles published from 1 December 2019 to 1 April 2020 were included in this review. REVIEW METHODS Studies reporting on the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 using TCM regardless of study designs were included. In addition, grey literatures, including media reports on Chinese government websites or official media websites and treatment guidelines were searched for TCM treatment and prevention on COVID-19. RESULTS Limited research has been published on the use of TCM for COVID-19. We qualitatively described and synthesized the published research and current clinical practice on the use of TCM for COVID-19, and focused on the following areas: TCM treatment used in SARS, MERS, H1N1; TCM treatment plan for COVID-19; TCM in Prevention and Treatment at Early Stage of COVID-19; TCM emotional therapy; and personalized TCM treatment plan. CONCLUSION The combination of western medicine and TCM in treatment, and treatment based on the local condition, isolation, personal protective measures are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Relevant laboratory research and clinical evaluation should be continued to collect scientific evidences on the efficacy of TCM. IMPACT TCM has been used in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in China, and the clinical evidences indicated that TCM regulates immunity and exerts anti-viral effect simultaneously.

Objective To compare intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) plus methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone as initial therapy in MIS-C. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study drawn from a national surveillance system with propensity score-matched analysis. All cases with suspected MIS-C were reported to the French National Public Health Agency. Confirmed MIS-C cases fulfilling the World Health Organization definition were included. The study started on April 1, 2020, and follow-up ended on January 6, 2021. Exposures IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was persistence of fever 2 days after the introduction of initial therapy or recrudescence of fever within 7 days, which defined treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included a second-line therapy, hemodynamic support, acute left ventricular dysfunction after first-line therapy, and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary analysis involved propensity score matching with a minimum caliper of 0.1. Results Among 181 children with suspected MIS-C, 111 fulfilled the World Health Organization definition (58 females [52%]; median age, 8.6 years [interquartile range, 4.7 to 12.1]). Five children did not receive either treatment. Overall, 3 of 34 children (9%) in the IVIG and methylprednisolone group and 37 of 72 (51%) in the IVIG alone group did not respond to treatment. Treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone was associated with lower risk of treatment failure (absolute risk difference, -0.28 [95% CI, -0.48 to -0.08]; odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.70]; P = .008). IVIG and methylprednisolone therapy vs IVIG alone was also significantly associated with lower risk of use of second-line therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.22 [95% CI, -0.40 to -0.04]; OR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.61]; P = .004), hemodynamic support (absolute risk difference, -0.17 [95% CI, -0.34 to -0.004]; OR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.76]), acute left ventricular dysfunction occurring after initial therapy (absolute risk difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01]; OR, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.66]), and duration of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (median, 4 vs 6 days; difference in days, -2.4 [95% CI, -4.0 to -0.7]).

MATERIAL AND METHODS A Respironics V60 ventilator was connected to an active lung simulator modeling mildly restrictive, severely restrictive, obstructive and mixed obstructive/restrictive profiles. Pressure-support ventilation (PSV) and proportional-assist ventilation (PAV) were set to obtain similar tidal volume (VT). PAV was applied at flow assist (FA) 40-90% of resistance (Rrs) and volume assist (VA) 40-90% of elastance (Ers). Measurements were performed with system air leak of 25-28 L/minute. Ventilator performance and simulator-ventilator asynchrony were evaluated. RESULTS At comparable VT, PAV had slightly lower peak inspiratory flow and higher driving pressure compared with PSV. Premature cycling occurred in the obstructive, severely restrictive and mildly restrictive models. During PAV, time for airway pressure to achieve 90% of maximum during inspiration (T90) in the severely restrictive model was shorter than those of the obstructive and mixed obstructive/restrictive models and close to that measured in the PSV mode. Increasing FA level reduced inspiratory trigger workload (PTP₃₀₀) in obstructive and mixed obstructive/restrictive models. Increasing FA level decreased inspiratory time (TI) and tended to aggravate premature cycling, whereas increasing VA level attenuated this effect. CONCLUSIONS PAV with an appropriate combination of FA and VA decreases work of breathing during the inspiratory phase and improves simulator-ventilator cycling synchrony. FA has greater impact than VA in the adaptation to inspiratory effort demand. High VA level might help improve cycling synchrony.","Chen, Yuqing; Yuan, Yueyang; Zhang, Hai; Li, Feng",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.914629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31778366/,211

We report a case of successful surgical treatment of chronic refractory neuropathic pain after inguinal hernia by laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy. CASE PRESENTATION A seventy-year-old male who underwent right-side inguinal hernia repair using the Lichtenstein method revisited our hospital with inguinodynia 16 months after surgery. After a thorough assessment, the patient was diagnosed with neuropathic pain based on the following: 1) dermatomal mapping suggested ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve problems, 2) pain was evoked by specific movement, 3) the site of maximum pain was slightly changed at every physical examination, and 4) no evidence of recurrence or meshoma was observed on MRI. Conservative therapies were ineffective. Surgical intervention using laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy was performed 4 months after treatment initiation. In the lateral recumbent position, a three-port method was used. The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerves were identified and resected. Although a residual nerve emerged from L2/3 toward the inguinal region, the nerve remained in situ. Pain assessment 3h after surgery revealed that pain was decreased but remained. Reoperation involving resection of the residual nerve was performed on the same day. Although another type of mild pain appeared 3 months after surgery, the patient resumed normal life, without any restrictions. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy is useful for treating refractory neuropathic pain. The diagnosis of neuropathic pain via thorough preoperative assessment is vital for procedure success because the procedure would not be effective for other types of pain.","Narita, Masato; Jikihara, Shunpei; Hata, Hiroaki; Matsusue, Ryo; Yamaguchi, Takashi; Otani, Tetsushi; Ikai, Iwao",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2017.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942229/,211

Previous studies have demonstrated that bariatric surgery is superior to intensive medical management for reduction of weight and obesity-related comorbidities. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a publicly funded, population-based bariatric treatment program. METHODS We followed consecutive bariatric surgery patients for 2 years. The primary outcome was weight change (in kilograms). Between-group changes were analyzed using multivariable regression. Last-observation-carried-forward imputation was used for missing data. RESULTS We included 150 consecutive patients (51 RYGB; 51 LSG; 48 LAGB) in our study. At baseline, mean age was 43.5 ± 9.5 years, 87.3% of patients were women, and preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 46.2 ± 7.4. Absolute and relative (% of baseline) weight loss at 2 years were 36.6 ± 19.5 kg (26.1 ± 12.2%) for RYGB, 21.4 ± 16.0 kg (16.4 ± 11.6%) for LSG and 7.0 ± 9.7 kg (5.8 ± 7.9%) for LAGB (p < 0.001). Change in BMI was greater for the RYGB (-13.0 ± 6.6) than both the LSG (-7.6 ± 5.7) and the LAGB (-2.6 ± 3.5) groups (p < 0.001). The reduction in diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia was greater after RYGB than after LAGB (all p < 0.05). There were no deaths. The anastomotic and staple leakage rate was 1.3%. CONCLUSION In a publicly funded, population-based bariatric surgery program, RYGB and LSG demonstrated greater weight loss than the LAGB procedure. Bypass resulted in the greatest reduction in obesity-related comorbidities.

However, little has been written comparing this technique with the circular stapler technique. The objective of this retrospective study was to assess the safety and efficacy of cervical delta-shaped anastomosis after esophagectomy. METHODS Medical records of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent McKeown (three-incision) esophagectomy between September 2013 and June 2015 were reviewed. Either circular stapled anastomosis (CSA) or delta-shaped anastomosis (DSA) was performed at the cervical stage. The clinical characteristics and short-term outcome were retrospectively assessed to identify the differences between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 81 patients were included in this study. The clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. Cervical anastomotic leakage occurred in 3 (7.7%) of 39 patients in the DSA group and in 8 (19%) of 42 patients in the CSA group (P = 0.197). The average anastomotic orifice width was 16.1 ± 4.9 mm and 11.7 ± 2.2 mm, respectively (P < 0.001). The incidence of anastomotic stenosis was 2.6% (1/39) and 23.5% (10/42) in the DSA and CSA groups, respectively (P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in surgical duration, blood loss, pulmonary complication, postoperative mortality, time of hospitalisation and time of ICU stay between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Delta-shaped anastomosis may be an effective alternative method for gastroesophageal anastomosis after esophagectomy, with lower incidence of leakage and stenosis.","Huang, Chen; Xu, Xunhai; Zhuang, Binbin; Chen, Wenshu; Xu, Xunyu; Wang, Chao; Lin, Shengmei",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-017-1097-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28103879/,211

Material and Methods This retrospective, single-center study evaluated 21 patients (10 males and 11 females; mean age 73.8 ± 8.2 years) with Stage I peripheral NSCLCs treated with MWA between 2010 and 2020. All patients were surveyed for metastatic disease. Clinical success was defined as absence of FDG avidity on follow-up imaging. Tumor growth within 5 mm of the original ablated territory was defined as local recurrence. Welch t-test and Fisher's exact test were used for univariate analysis. Hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) were determined using Cox regression and Firth logistic regression. Significance was P < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Results Ablated tumors had longest dimension 17.4 ± 5.4 mm and depth 19.7 ± 15.1 mm from the pleural surface. Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 0.6-56 months). Mean overall survival (OS) following lung cancer diagnosis or MWA was 26.2 ± 15.4 months (range, 5-56 months) and 23.7 ± 15.1 months (range, 3-55 months). OS at 1, 2, and 5 years was 67.6%, 61.8%, and 45.7%, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 19.1 ± 16.2 months (range, 1-55 months). PFS at 1, 2, and 5 years was 44.5%, 32.9%, and 32.9%, respectively. Technical success was 100%, while clinical success was observed in 95.2% (20/21) of patients. One patient had local residual disease following MWA and was treated with chemotherapy. Local control was 90% with recurrence in two patients following ablation. Six patients (28.6%) experienced post-ablation complications, with pneumothorax being the most common event (23.8% of patients). Female gender was associated with 90% reduction in risk of death (HR 0.1, P = 0.014). Tumor longest dimension was associated with a 10% increase in risk of death (P = 0.197). Several comorbidities were associated with increased hazard. Univariate analysis revealed pre-ablation forced vital capacity trended higher among survivors (84.7 ± 15.2% vs. 73 ± 21.6%, P = 0.093). Adjusted for age and sex, adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine histology trended toward improved OS (OR: 0.13, 0.13) and PFS (OR: 0.88, 0.37) compared to squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion MWA provides a safe and effective alternative to stereotactic brachytherapy resulting in promising OS and PFS in patients with Stage I peripheral NSCLC.

DESIGN Prospective phase I clinical trial. SETTING Medical center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. PATIENTS Moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 200. INTERVENTIONS Scaling for doses was required by Taiwan Food and Drug Administration as follows: the first three patients received low-dose human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (1.0 × 10 cells/kg), the next three patients with intermediate dose (5.0 × 10 cells/kg), and the final three patients with high dose (1.0 × 10 cells/kg) between December 2017 and August 2019. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Nine consecutive patients were enrolled into the study. In-hospital mortality was 33.3% (3/9), including two with recurrent septic shock and one with ventilator-induced severe pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. No serious prespecified cell infusion-associated or treatment-related adverse events was identified in any patient. Serial flow-cytometric analyses of circulating inflammatory biomarkers (CD14CD33/CD11b+CD16+/CD16+MPO+/CD11b+MPO+/CD14CD33+) and mesenchymal stem cell markers (CD26+CD45-/CD29+CD45-/CD34+CD45-/CD44+CD45-/CD73+CD45-/CD90+CD45-/CD105+CD45-/CD26+CD45-) were notably progressively reduced (p for trend < 0.001), whereas the immune cell markers (Helper-T-cell/Cytotoxity-T-cell/Regulatory-T-cell) were notably increased (p for trend < 0.001) after cell infusion.

The average contact times were 12 (7,16) and the average cumulative contact time was 2 (1.5,2.7) h.Clinical symptoms of these patients were fever in 23 patients (76.67%) , headache in 16 petients (53.33%) , fatigue or myalgia in 21patients (70%) , nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in 9 petients (30%) , cough in 25 petients (83.33%) , and dyspnea in 14 petients (46.67%) .Routine blood test revealed WBC <4.0×10(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) ×10(9)/L in 22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC>4.0×10(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the disease.Lymphocyte count <1.0×10(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%), elevated D-dimer (>0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). Compared with normal patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period, the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in the patients infected in unprotected period. Conclusion: Medical staffs are at higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the amount of suction virus. Severe patients had BMI increased, heating time prolonged , white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer and albumin level significantly changed and were prone to be complicated with liver damage and myocardial damage.Strict protection measures is important to prevent infection for medical workers.","Liu, M; He, P; Liu, H G; Wang, X J; Li, F J; Chen, S; Lin, J; Chen, P; Liu, J H; Li, C H",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062957/,211
132217,Analysis and recommendations for reducing risks of patient crosscontaminations via noncritical medical devices.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Physician burnout, wellness, and resilience have become increasingly important topics of discussion worldwide. While studies have assessed burnout globally in various individual countries, few studies directly compare or analyze gender-based physician burnout among different global regions. METHODS Female physicians attending the Medical Women's International Association (MWIA) Centennial Congress completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) which evaluates personal-, work-, and patient-related burnout using a scale of 0 to 100. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and 1-way ANOVA to compare burnout scores amongst women physicians from different global regions. RESULTS Of 100 physicians invited to participate, 76 provided responses and 71 met the inclusion criteria. Mean burnout scores were highest amongst women from Africa in all categories. Mean work-related, patient-related, and personal-related burnout scores were significantly lower for physicians in Europe compared to Africa (p = 0.05) when evaluated using a 1-way ANOVA, with no statistically significant differences between other regions. DISCUSSION The data suggests that there may be regional differences in the prevalence of burnout in women physicians. Various factors could play a role in explaining the higher burnout scores in female physicians in Africa, including younger average age, establishing practice during childbearing years, and significant physician shortage. Through this study, we have begun to explore the cultural and geographical context related to women's mental and physical wellbeing in the medical field. Further research should focus on the gender-specific contributors to burnout among different global regions, so that methods can be implemented on a systemic level to alleviate burnout.","Haffizulla, Farzanna S; Newman, Connie; Kaushal, Shivani; Williams, Caitlin A; Haffizulla, Anisa; Hardigan, Patrick; Templeton, Kim",The Permanente journal,https://doi.org/10.7812/tpp/20.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33482938/,211

Since many people cope with stress by eating, the current study investigated whether eating behaviors shifted among U.S. adults after the emergence of the pandemic. Data from national, crowdsourced surveys conducted on March 31st, 2020 and February 13th, 2019 were compared. Average levels of eating to cope and food addiction symptoms did not appear to shift during the early stages of the pandemic; however, U.S. adults ate about 14% more added sugars. Moreover, greater stress in response to the pandemic was associated with greater eating to cope, added sugars intake, food addiction symptoms, drinking to cope, and drinking frequency. These associations differed by the presence of state-level stay-at-home orders, perceived vulnerability to disease, age, U.S. political party affiliation, and gender. Although eating behaviors did not appear to majorly shift during the early stages of the pandemic, stress from the pandemic may intensify some maladaptive coping tendencies among U.S. adults.","Cummings, Jenna R; Ackerman, Joshua M; Wolfson, Julia A; Gearhardt, Ashley N",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587985/,211
133564,Supporting Children With Neurodevelopmental Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND Renal denervation (RDN) is a catheter-based intervention to treat patients with resistant hypertension. The biological effects of RDN are not fully understood, and randomized controlled trials have generated conflicting evidence. This report presents data from the Swedish Registry for Renal Denervation, an investigator-driven nationwide registry. PURPOSE To assess the safety and efficacy of RDN on patients with resistant hypertension in a real-world clinical setting. METHODS This nationwide database contains patient characteristics, procedural details, and follow-up data on all RDN procedures performed in Sweden. Consecutive procedures between 2011 and 2015 were included. RESULTS The data analysis consists of 252 patients (mean age 61 ± 10 years, 38% women; mean 4.5 ± 1.5 antihypertensive drugs). Office SBP and DBP and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) decreased 6 months after RDN (176 ± 23/97 ± 17 to 161 ± 26/91 ± 16 mmHg, both P < 0.001; and 155 ± 17/89 ± 14 to 147 ± 18/82 ± 12 mmHg, both P < 0.001). Significant office and ambulatory BP reductions persisted throughout the observation period of 36 months. Major procedure-related vascular complications occurred in four patients. Renal function and number of antihypertensive drugs were unchanged during follow-up. CONCLUSION In this complete national cohort, RDN was associated with a sustained reduction in office and ambulatory BP in patients with resistant hypertension. The procedure proved to be feasible and associated with a low-complication rate, including long-term adverse events.","Völz, Sebastian; Spaak, Jonas; Elf, Johan; Jägrén, Christina; Lundin, Christer; Stenborg, Anna; Andersson, Jonas; Rundqvist, Bengt; Kahan, Thomas; Andersson, Bert",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000001517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210862/,211

133973,Frontline Health Care Workers' Mental Workload During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study.,2021-02-23,"Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is a clinical syndrome marked by progressive dyspnea and cough with the absence of parenchymal lung disease on radiographic studies. Pulmonary function testing reveals an obstructive ventilatory defect that is typically not reversed by inhaled bronchodilator. Transbronchial biopsies are insufficiently sensitive to achieve diagnosis, and in most cases, clinical, physiological, and radiological data obviate the need for the increased risk associated with open lung biopsy. This diagnosis has been documented in a variety of exposures, including fumes from flavoring plants, smoke from burn pits, and environmental sulfur gas. Among lung transplant recipients, ""bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome,"" a disorder with clinical and histopathological similarity to OB, represents the leading cause of long-term allograft dysfunction and mortality. After hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chronic graft versus host disease of the lung manifests most frequently with similar clinical and pathological features. In all circumstances, immunologic and nonimmunologic mechanisms are thought to lead to airway epithelial dysfunction, which results in progressive airflow obstruction and debility. Augmentation of immunosuppression is occasionally effective in slowing or reversing the progression of disease though a significant number of patients will be nonresponders. Other immunomodulatory methods have been attempted in each circumstance where this pathology has been identified. Unfortunately, OB is poorly understood and often results in sufficient progression of disease to warrant evaluation for lung transplantation (or retransplantation). Here, we review what is known regarding pathophysiology and discuss clinical, pathological, radiological, and therapeutic factors associated with the spectrum of OB-related disease with a particular focus on lung transplantation.","Aguilar, Patrick R; Michelson, Andrew P; Isakow, Warren",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000000892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26335918/,211

This work examines respective data from Germany by way of example. METHODS Using monthly and weekly all-cause mortality data from January 2016 to June 2020 (published by the German Federal Statistical Institute) for all ages,<65 years and≥65 years, and specified for Germany's federal states, we explored mortality as sequela of COVID-19. We analysed standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) comparing 2020 with 2016-2019 as reference years with a focus on trend detection. RESULTS In Germany as a whole, elevated mortality in April (most pronounced for Bavaria) declined in May. The states of Hamburg and Bremen had increased SMRs in all months under study. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, decreased SMRs in January turned monotonically to increased SMRs by June. Irrespective of age group, this trend was pronounced and significant. CONCLUSIONS Increased SMRs in Hamburg and Bremen must be interpreted with caution because of potential upward distortions due to a ""catchment bias"". A pronounced excess mortality in April across Germany was confirmed and a hitherto undetected trend of increasing SMRs for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania was revealed. To meet the pandemic challenge and to benefit from research based on data collected in standardized ways, national authorities should regularly conduct SMR analyses. For independent analyses, national authorities should also expedite publishing raw mortality and population data, including detailed information on age, sex, and cause of death, in the public domain.","Morfeld, Peter; Timmermann, Barbara; Groß, J Valérie; Lewis, Philip; Erren, Thomas C",Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1531-5507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496443/,211
136032,Are Social Status and Migration Background Associated with Utilization of Non-medical Antenatal Care? Analyses from Two German Studies.,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate whether morphological evidence of intracranial vascular injury can be found in the occluding thrombi of patients with ischemic stroke. METHODS From 2015 until 2018 specimens of thrombi from patients with large vessel occlusion treated either by stent-assisted aspiration thrombectomy (TE) or by aspiration thrombectomy were prospectively collected. Thrombus specimens were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and stained. Architectural features, presence of parts of vessel wall or atheromatous material, organisation of the thrombi, technique and number of thrombectomy manoeuvers were evaluated. RESULTS Thrombus specimens from 302 patients were analyzed. 238 (80%) patients were treated with stent-assisted aspiration TE and 64 (20%) patients with aspiration TE only. 286 (95%) had fresh thrombi, 14 (4.6%) showed initial/complete thrombus organisation and multi-staged thrombi were found in 2 (<1%) patients. In 8 patients (2.6%) we found atypical thrombus content after a time interval longer 6 hours after onset and final thrombectomy manoeuvre: 4 with atheromatous material and 4 with parts of a vessel wall. In 1 patient with parts of vessel wall angiographically a dissection was detected. No parts of the vessel wall were found after sole aspiration thrombectomy. CONCLUSIONS The overall risk of arterial vessel wall injury aspiration thrombectomy was low in our study. Aspiration thrombectomy and the procedure related with a retrieving device together with an ischemia time longer than 6 hours may increase the risk of vessel injury through the thrombectomy procedure. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the influence of the mentioned aspects.","Donnerstag, Frank; Götz, Friedrich; Dadak, Mete; Raab, Peter; Iglesias, Enrico Calvino; Werlein, Christopher; Lanfermann, Heinrich; Jonigk, Danny","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019920976673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269973/,211

An analysis of airflow records from the continuous positive airway pressure machine revealed a rise in his respiratory rate on the night before the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms, while his nocturnal respiratory rate had been stable during the 18-month period prior to the presently reported episode. The present case suggests that a rise in respiratory rate detected using continuous positive airway pressure machine data could be an important sign of impending acute illness, such as COVID-19.

How the physical properties of vaccine carriers such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) influence this cascade is unclear. We fabricated 80-nm MSNs with different pore sizes (7.8 nm, 10.3 nm, and 12.9 nm) and loaded them with ovalbumin antigen. Results demonstrated these MSNs with different pore sizes were equally effective in the first three steps of the DUMP cascade, but those with larger pores showed higher cross-presentation efficiency (step 4). Consistently, large-pore MSNs loaded with B16F10 tumor antigens yielded the strongest antitumor effects. These results demonstrate the promise of our lymph node-targeting large-pore MSNs as vaccine-delivery vehicles for immune activation and cancer vaccination.","Hong, Xiaoyu; Zhong, Xiaofang; Du, Guangsheng; Hou, Yingying; Zhang, Yunting; Zhang, Zhirong; Gong, Tao; Zhang, Ling; Sun, Xun",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596445/,211

In order to achieve effective optimisation for each application, this work aims to assess the impact of the various synthesis parameters on the final textural properties of the gel. Here, the formation of porous organic gels is modelled using a three-dimensional lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation. We model growth from monomer species into the interconnected primary clusters of a gel, and account for varying catalyst concentration and solids content, two parameters proven to control gel properties in experimental work. In addition to analysing the textural properties of the simulated materials, we also explore their fractal properties through correlation dimension and Hurst exponent calculations. The correlation dimension shows that while fractal properties are not typically observed in scattering experiments, they are possible to achieve with sufficiently low solids content and catalyst concentration. Furthermore, fractal properties are also apparent from the analysis of the diffusion path of guest species through the gel's porous network. This model, therefore, provides insight into how porous organic gels can be manufactured with their textural and fractal properties computationally tailored according to the intended application.","Martin, Elisha; Prostredny, Martin; Fletcher, Ashleigh; Mulheran, Paul",Gels,https://doi.org/10.3390/gels6030023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764292/,211
138642,COVID-19: A Closer Lens.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND There is an increasing interest in patient-reported outcome measurement to evaluate hernia operations. Several hernia-specific quality of life (QoL) scales have been proposed, but none are constructed for preoperative assessment. METHODS The European Registry for Abdominal Wall Hernias (EuraHS) proposed the short, 9-question EuraHS-QoL instrument for assessment pre- and postoperatively. The EuraHS-QoL was evaluated in a prospective, multicenter validation study alongside the Visual Analogue Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, and Carolina Comfort Scale (https://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01936584). RESULTS We included 101 patients undergoing unilateral laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with ProGrip laparoscopic, self-fixating mesh. Clinical follow-up at 12 months was 87% complete. The EuraHS-QoL score shows good internal consistency (Cronbach's α ≥ .90), good test-retest reliability (Spearman correlation coefficient r ≥ 0.72), and high correlation for pain with the Visual Analogue Scale, the Verbal Rating Scale, the Carolina Comfort Scale pain scale (r between 0.64 and 0.86), and for restriction of activity with the Carolina Comfort Scale movement scale (r between 0.65 and 0.79). Our results show significant improvement in quality of life at 3 weeks compared with preoperative and further significant improvement at 12 months (P < .05). No late complications or recurrences were recorded. An operation was performed in day surgery (>75%) or with a <24-hour admission (>95%) in the majority of the patients. CONCLUSION The EuraHS-QoL instrument is a short and valid patient-reported outcome measurement following groin hernia repair. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with ProGrip laparoscopic, self-fixating mesh results in a favorable outcome and significant improvement of quality of life compared with the preoperative assessment.","Muysoms, Filip E; Vanlander, Aude; Ceulemans, Robrecht; Kyle-Leinhase, Iris; Michiels, Maarten; Jacobs, Ivo; Pletinckx, Pieter; Berrevoet, Frederik",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2016.04.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27316825/,211

To review and discuss available evidence supporting that spirometry is an overlooked global health marker, that could be used regularly through the lifespan to monitor human health and predict risk of chronic respiratory and other chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs). 2. To discuss the challenges and opportunities that this proposal faces.Summary of key data. First, spirometry is essential to assess and monitor respiratory health. Second, spirometry adds prognostic value to other well-accepted health markers used in clinical practice, such as blood pressure, body mass index, glucose and blood lipids, by identifying individuals at risk, not only of respiratory diseases, but also of other NCDs, particularly cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. CONCLUSION Although we acknowledge that research gaps still exist, we propose that spirometry assessed during childhood, adolescence and early and late adulthood can be a reproducible, non-invasive, safe and affordable global health marker to identify individuals in the general population at risk of respiratory and non-respiratory NCDs. In this context, spirometry may act as the caged canaries that miners used to carry into mines to alert them of dangerous accumulations of gases, thus providing an early warning and save lives.","Agusti, Alvar; Fabbri, Leonardo M; Baraldi, Eugenio; Celli, Bartolome; Corradi, Massimo; Faner, Rosa; Martinez, Fernando D; Melén, Erik; Papi, Alberto",European journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2021.04.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016514/,211

The management of the pandemic in Australia required rapid and reliable testing of large numbers of specimens for the novel influenza strain and differentiation from seasonal influenza strains. A real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was designed and used with existing real-time RT-PCR assays for seasonal influenza viruses A and B. MS2 coliphage was added to all samples and amplified as a quality control. Three duplex RT-PCR assays, each containing two primer pairs and corresponding 5' nuclease probes, were initially evaluated on control material and stored samples and showed high sensitivity and specificity. More than 11,000 clinical samples were then tested for influenza A and B matrix gene targets and specific hemagglutinin gene targets for seasonal influenza A/H1, A/H3, and pandemic A (H1N1) 2009.

The Pandemic influenza preparedness framework for the sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits (the PIP framework) was adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2011. The experiences and lessons learnt from the implementation of the PIP framework have provided insights that can be used to strengthen preparedness for epidemics of other priority high-threat pathogens in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region in line with obligations under the International Health Regulations, 2005 (IHR). Implementation has established policies, strategies, action plans, strengthened systems and operational readiness to promptly diagnose influenza virus strains with pandemic potential and ensure timely event notifications and management in compliance with the IHR. WHO collaborating centres and the annual bi-regional meeting of national influenza centres and influenza surveillance have strengthened the influenza laboratory diagnostic knowledge network in the region. After action reviews following influenza outbreaks have documented best practices, strengths, constraints and areas for improvement in pandemic preparedness. The pandemic in 2009 and recent seasonal influenza outbreaks have offered real-life scenarios for testing national pandemic influenza preparedness plans and deploying vaccines. The successful implementation of the PIP framework, along with strengthening of health systems and operational procedures and continued technical collaboration with global centres of excellence, should be tapped into to strengthen preparedness to respond to epidemics of other high-threat pathogens based on the influenza model. The political commitment reflected in the Delhi Declaration on Emergency Preparedness, signed by all ministers of health in September 2019 and supported by the Five-year regional strategic plan to strengthen public health preparedness and response - 2019-2023, should be a catalyst for guidance and support in developing a broad, long-term strategic plan for preparedness and response to high-threat pathogens in the region.","Wijesinghe, Pushpa R; Ofrin, Roderico H; Bhola, Anil K; Inbanathan, Francis Y; Bezbaruah, Supriya",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/2224-3151.282995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341221/,211

We previously demonstrated the ability of a newly developed polymer to provide controlled release of an antibiotic in a linear fashion over 45 d. We subsequently showed that coating mesh with the drug-releasing polymer prevented a Staphylococcus aureus (SA) infection in vivo. To broaden the applicability of this technology, the polymer was synthesized as isolated ""microspheres"" and loaded with vancomycin (VM) before conducting a noninferiority analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-three mice underwent creation of a dorsal subcutaneous pocket that was inoculated with 104 colony forming units (CFU) of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled SA (105 CFU/mL). Multifilament polyester mesh (7 × 7 mm) was placed into the pocket, and the skin was closed. Mesh was either placed alone (n = 16), coated with VM-loaded polymer (n = 20), placed next to VM-loaded microspheres (n = 20) or unloaded microspheres (n = 10), or flushed with VM solution (n = 7). Quantitative tissue/mesh cultures were performed at 2 and 4 week. Mice with open wounds and explanted mesh were excluded. RESULTS Twenty-two of 23 (96%) tissue-mesh samples from mesh alone or empty miscrospheres were positive for GFP-labeled SA at 2 and 4 wk. Six of seven (86%) samples from the VM flush group were positive for GFP SA at 4 wk. Thirty-eight of 38 (100%) VM-loaded crosslinked cyclodextrin polymers-coated mesh or VM-loaded microspheres were negative for GFP SA at 2 and 4 wk. CONCLUSIONS Slow affinity-based drug-releasing polymers in the form of microspheres are able to adequately clear a bacterial burden of SA and prevent mesh infection.","Grafmiller, Kevin T; Zuckerman, Sean T; Petro, Clayton; Liu, Lijia; von Recum, Horst A; Rosen, Michael J; Korley, Julius N",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2016.06.099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916373/,211
142535,Lockdown and adolescent mental health: reflections from a child and adolescent psychotherapist.,2020,"Background Dexamethasone has been routinely used in the pre-operative setting to enhance analgesia and decrease the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing primary arthroplasty. However, dexamethasone has the potential to increase blood glucose levels postoperatively, which is a known risk factor for complications after total joint arthroplasty. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of dexamethasone administration on post-operative blood glucose levels in diabetic patients after primary hip and knee arthroplasty. Methods This study was a retrospective review of 238 diabetic patients who underwent primary hip and knee arthroplasty between May 1, 2014 and September 30, 2016 at a single urban academic medical center. A total of 77 patients (32.4%) received dexamethasone and 161 (67.7%) did not. Oral hyperglycemic agents were held during the inpatient stay and blood glucose was controlled either with sliding scale insulin or home insulin regimens were continued. All analyses were adjusted for age, BMI, gender, type of diabetes, pre-operative diabetic medication, type of surgical procedure, and pre-operative HgbA1c level. The primary outcome was post-operative hyperglycemia within 72 h of surgery defined as any blood glucose level greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Results Post-operative hyperglycemia was observed in 17.1 and 20.6% of the measurements during the first 24 and 72 h respectively. After controlling for confounding variables, patients who received dexamethasone had 4.07 (95% CI: 2.46, 6.72) and 3.08 (95% CI: 2.34, 4.04) higher odds of post-operative hyperglycemia in the first 24 and 72 h respectively. Conclusions Dexamethasone administration in diabetic patients undergoing primary arthroplasty increases post-operative hyperglycemia during the first 24 and 72 h. While our data did not investigate causation, dexamethasone use in this patient population should be thoughtfully considered, as post-operative hyperglycemia is a known risk factor for complications.","O'Connell, Robert S; Clinger, Bryce N; Donahue, Erin E; Celi, Francesco S; Golladay, Gregory J",Patient safety in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13037-018-0178-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410577/,211
145395,"Employment insecurity, mental health and suicide.",2017,"IntroductionUstekinumab induced eosinophilic pneumonia is rare and to our knowledge, this is the 5th reported case of such an entity.Case StudyA 60-year-old female was admitted with worsening shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 4 months. Her past medical history was significant for Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis that was previously managed with Adalimumab and switched to Ustekinumab 2 months beforesymptoms. Initial diagnostic workup showed 10% peripheral eosinophilia and a CT chest showed numerous 5 mm nodules scattered throughout the lungs along with some peripheral reticulations.Her BAL fluid analysis showed abnormally high eosinophil count (67%), greatly limiting her potential diagnoses to eosinophilic pneumonia, EGPA, and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE). AEP typically causes more severe disease with a rapid onset and there was low suspicion for TPE based on history, leaving EGPA and CEP.Based on her negative autoimmune serology, a negative biopsy of the nasal mucosa (no vasculitis/granulomata or eosinophils), and negative infectious workup, the patient was diagnosed with CEP secondary to Ustekinumab and the drug was stopped. She was started on high dose prednisone and after a prolonged taper over 5 months, her symptoms and nodules and reticulations on her CT scan resolved.DiscussionThis case exemplifies the importance of identifying drug-induced lung diseases which in many cases might not have a strong temporal association with the symptom onset. It also highlights that some drugs owing to their long elimination half-time can remain in the system for a prolonged period and continue to cause symptoms despite their cessation and require prolonged treatment and reassurance.ConclusionThe association of eosinophilic pneumonia with Ustekinumab, a drug used in the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, is rare and there is a paucity of literature regarding this association.","Kalra, Saminder Singh; Trillo, Cesar; Papierniak, Eric",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2020.1827416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962463/,211

Determinants of HIV testing during diagnosis of AIDS-defining cancers in vulnerable populations, where risk for HIV infection is higher, are under-explored. METHODS We examine factors associated with patterns of HIV testing among Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with ICC. Using linked data from the New Jersey State Cancer Registry and New Jersey Medicaid claims and enrollment files, we evaluated HIV testing among 242 ICC cases diagnosed from 2012 to 2014 in ages 21-64 at (a) any point during Medicaid enrollment (2011-2014) and (b) during cancer workup 6 months pre ICC diagnosis to 6 months post ICC diagnosis. Logistic regression models identified factors associated with HIV testing. RESULTS Overall, 13% of women had a claim for HIV testing during ICC workup. Two-thirds (68%) of women did not have a claim for HIV testing (non-receipt of HIV testing) while enrolled in Medicaid. Hispanic/NH-API/Other women had lower odds of non-receipt of HIV testing compared with NH-Whites (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17-0.94). Higher odds of non-receipt of HIV testing were observed among cases with no STI testing (OR: 4.92; 95% CI 2.27-10.67) and < 1 year of Medicaid enrollment (OR: 3.07; 95% CI 1.14- 8.26) after adjusting for other factors. CONCLUSIONS Few women had HIV testing claims during ICC workup. Opportunities for optimal ICC care are informed by knowledge of HIV status. Further research should explore if lack of HIV testing claims during ICC workup is an accurate indicator of ICC care, and if so, to assess testing barriers during workup.","McGee-Avila, Jennifer K; Doose, Michelle; Nova, Jose; Kumar, Rizie; Stroup, Antoinette M; Tsui, Jennifer",Cancer causes & control : CCC,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-020-01333-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803402/,211

Although vaccine hesitancy has existed among a small percentage of people for centuries, its harmful effects are likely to be more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will pose substantial risks for both people who delay or refuse to be vaccinated and the wider community. It will make communities unable to reach thresholds of coverage necessary for herd immunity against COVID-19, thus unnecessarily perpetuating the pandemic and resulting in untold suffering and deaths. Vaccine hesitancy is pervasive, misinformed, contagious, and is not limited to COVID-19 vaccination. Our work shows that vaccine hesitancy is a complex and dynamic social process that reflects multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. People's vaccination views and practices usually comprise an ongoing engagement that is contingent on unfolding personal and social circumstances, which can potentially change over time. Therefore, as COVID-19 vaccination rolls out globally, scientists and decision-makers need to investigate the scale and determinants of vaccine hesitancy in each setting; so that tailored and targeted strategies can be developed to address it.","Wiysonge, Charles Shey; Ndwandwe, Duduzile; Ryan, Jill; Jaca, Anelisa; Batouré, Oumarou; Anya, Blanche-Philomene Melanga; Cooper, Sara",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1893062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684019/,211

Acute acro-ischemia or chilblain like lesions were among the first recognized dermatological presentations of COVID-19. Though the occurrence of such lesions has been attributed to the similar interferon-1 mediated immune response in both COVID-19 and systemic lupus erythematosus, we propose another possible explanation based on a common genetic background. In a recent genome-wide association study, the 3p21.31 region was found to be associated with COVID-19 severity. This region also contains the TREX1 gene. Missense mutations of the TREX1 gene are responsible for familial chilblain lupus and its genetic polymorphisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on this observation, herein we have reviewed other COVID-19 risk loci for potential overlap with dermatological conditions.","Jabalameli, Navid; Rajabi, Fateme; Firooz, Alireza; Rezaei, Nima",Immunological investigations,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820139.2021.1876086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494631/,211

Vacuolar cation/H+ exchangers (CAXs) have long been recognized as 'housekeeping' components in cellular Ca2+ and trace metal homeostasis, being involved in a range of key cellular and physiological processes. However, the mechanisms that drive functional activation of the transporters are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the function of a putative grapevine CAX-interacting protein, VvCXIP4, by testing its ability to activate VvCAX3, previously characterized as a tonoplast-localized Ca2+/H+ exchanger. VvCAX3 contains an autoinhibitory domain that drives inactivation of the transporter and thus, is incapable of suppressing the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype of the S. cerevisiae mutant K667. In this study, the co-expression of VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 in this strain efficiently rescued its growth defect at high Ca2+ levels. Flow cytometry experiments showed that yeast harboring both proteins effectively accumulated higher Ca2+ levels than cells expressing each of the proteins separately. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays allowed visualization of the direct interaction between the proteins in tobacco plants and in yeast, and also showed the self-interaction of VvCAX3 but not of VvCXIP4. Subcellular localization studies showed that, despite being primarily localized to the nucleus, VvCXIP4 is able to move to other cell compartments upon a Ca2+ stimulus, becoming prone to interaction with the tonoplast-localized VvCAX3. qPCR analysis showed that both genes are more expressed in grapevine stems and leaves, followed by the roots, and that the steady-state transcript levels were higher in the pulp than in the skin of grape berries. Also, both VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 were upregulated by Ca2+ and Na+, indicating they share common regulatory mechanisms. However, VvCXIP4 was also upregulated by Li+, Cu2+ and Mn2+, and its expression increased steadily throughout grape berry development, contrary to VvCAX3, suggesting additional physiological roles for VvCXIP4, including the regulation of VvCAXs not yet functionally characterized. The main novelty of the present study was the demonstration of physical interaction between CXIP and CAX proteins from a woody plant model by BiFC assays, demonstrating the intracellular mobilization of CXIPs in response to Ca2+.","Martins, Viviana; Gerós, Hernâni",Planta,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-020-03442-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767128/,211

150333,The Affordable Care Act: policy predictors of integrated care between Hispanic-serving and mainstream mental health organizations.,2021-02-28,"BACKGROUND Breast cancer is the most frequent neoplasm in women. Axillary lymph nodes dissection represents the treatment of choice in locally advanced breast cancer for prognostic and curative purposes. Seroma formation, an abnormal collection of fluid in the dead space of the axilla, is described in Literature with a wide range of incidence (3-85%). It is a source of significant morbidity and discomfort. The aim of the study is to compare the different haemostasis devices used in breast surgery, investigating the eventual superiority of an instrument among the others in terms of intraoperative and postoperative outcome, especially of seroma formation. METHODS Clinical cases of female patients undergone axillary lymph nodes dissection for local advanced breast cancer between January 2013 and July 2017 at the Surgery Unit of University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"" were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups, according to device utilized during surgery: Electrocautery, Harmonic Scalpel, LigaSure and Thunderbeat. All patients underwent II level axillary lymph nodes dissection associated to radical mastectomy or quadrantectomy. RESULTS One hundred consecutives patients were enrolled in the study. Intra-operative blood loss resulted statistically significant different (P < 0,01) between the Electrocautery group (94,7 ml) and the Thunderbeat group (57,2 ml), while the Harmonic Scalpel group and the Ligasure group, despite presented a lower amount of blood loss, did not differ significantly. Drainage volume resulted significantly lower (P = 0,002) in the comparison between the Electrocautery group and the Thunderbeat group; the Ligasure group and Harmonic Scapel group showed no difference between them and Electrocautery group. About the seroma formation, the Electrocautery group resulted affected by the highest seroma formation rate (64%). Seroma incidence in Harmonic Scalpel group was 24%, in Ligasure group was 44%, while Thunderbeat group showed the lowest presentation of seroma with 16%. CONCLUSIONS In patients affected by breast cancer requiring axillary lymphnodes dissection, the use of advanced hemostasis devices is highly desirable. Among the non-traditional tools, Thunderbeat resulted to be superior in terms of reduction of intra-operative blood loss and post-operative drainage output, moreover associated to a substantial reduction of postoperative seroma incidence.","Gambardella, Claudio; Clarizia, Guglielmo; Patrone, Renato; Offi, Chiara; Mauriello, Claudio; Romano, Roberto; Filardo, Marco; Conzo, Alessandra; Sanguinetti, Alessandro; Polistena, Andrea; Avenia, Nicola; Conzo, Giovanni",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-018-0454-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074399/,211

However, it remains unclear whether compliance to exercise in supervised settings translates to long-term adherence to physical activity in real-world, unstructured environments. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review is available on compliance and/or adherence rates to either modes of exercise for insufficiently active individuals. Furthermore, it is unclear which training modality insufficiently active individuals comply and/or adhere more readily to. Based on these gaps, the following two questions will be addressed: (1) What are compliance and adherence rates to high-intensity interval training for insufficiently active adults aged 18-65 years and (2) How do compliance and adherence rates differ between high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training? METHODS Both observational and experimental studies that report on compliance and/or adherence rates to high-intensity interval training will be included. Relevant studies will be retrieved from Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science using a pre-specified search strategy. Pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used by two independent researchers to determine eligible studies. Of those meeting the inclusion criteria, data extraction and narrative synthesis will be completed, and where applicable, random-effects meta-analyses will be computed to compare compliance and adherence rates between high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training. Meta-regressions and sensitivity analyses will be used to further explore factors that could influence aggregate effect sizes. Risk of bias will be assessed using established tools by the Cochrane association, and quality assessment of the cumulative evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION Results from this study may have the potential to inform future physical activity recommendations and guidelines on the ideal mode of exercise for the general population. This review will add to the body of literature on the feasibility of high-intensity interval training for an insufficiently active population, conclusively addressing the ongoing debate of whether it is an appropriate exercise choice for this demographic. With this new information, individuals working towards a healthier lifestyle through physical activity engagement may be better equipped to make an evidence-based decision.

Rescuers continue to use both traditional 1- or 2-handed mask-face sealing techniques, as well as a newer modified 2-handed technique. We compare the efficacy of 1-handed, 2-handed, and modified 2-handed bag-valve-mask technique. METHODS In this prospective, crossover study, health care providers performed 1-handed, 2-handed, and modified 2-handed bag-valve-mask ventilation on a standardized ventilation model. Subjects performed each technique for 5 minutes, with 3 minutes' rest between techniques. The primary outcome was expired tidal volume, defined as percentage of total possible expired tidal volume during a 5-minute bout. A specialized inline monitor measured expired tidal volume. We compared 2-handed versus modified 2-handed and 2-handed versus 1-handed techniques. RESULTS We enrolled 52 subjects: 28 (54%) men, 32 (62%) with greater than or equal to 5 actual emergency bag-valve-mask situations. Median expired tidal volume percentage for 1-handed technique was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17% to 51%); for 2-handed technique, 85% (95% CI 78% to 91%); and for modified 2-handed technique, 85% (95% CI 82% to 90%). Both 2-handed (median difference 47%; 95% CI 34% to 62%) and modified 2-handed technique (median difference 56%; 95% CI 29% to 65%) resulted in significantly higher median expired tidal volume percentages compared with 1-handed technique. The median expired tidal volume percentages between 2-handed and modified 2-handed techniques did not significantly differ from each other (median difference 0; 95% CI -2% to 2%). CONCLUSION In a simulated model, both 2-handed mask-face sealing techniques resulted in higher ventilatory tidal volumes than 1-handed technique. Tidal volumes from 2-handed and modified 2-handed techniques did not differ. Rescuers should perform bag-valve-mask ventilation with 2-handed techniques.","Otten, David; Liao, Michael M; Wolken, Robert; Douglas, Ivor S; Mishra, Ramya; Kao, Amanda; Barrett, Whitney; Drasler, Erin; Byyny, Richard L; Haukoos, Jason S",Annals of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2013.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23937957/,211

155852,Protecting Youth Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Challenging Engagement and Learning Process.,2020-11-01,"PRACTICAL RELEVANCE While the most common cause of chronic upper respiratory disease signs in cats is viral disease, with subsequent, self-perpetuating inflammation, other, more discrete causes need to be ruled out. These include foreign bodies, bacterial or fungal infections, oral-dental diseases and neoplasia. Any factors contributing to alterations in the structure or function of the upper airways, including inflammation of any cause, will compromise normal function and predispose to chronic damage if the cat is unable to resolve the underlying factors. CLINICAL CHALLENGES The chronic feline snuffler is a frustrating patient to treat. The longer the course of disease, the more severe the consequences to affected tissues, and the more debilitated the patient becomes. A logical diagnostic plan to differentiate probable etiologies and to rule out non-viral causes results in appropriate therapeutic choices. Even with a viral etiology, therapies to reduce the pathological consequences of infection may modulate and help control the clinical signs. Some novel choices and drug combinations are discussed in this review. PATIENT GROUP Cats of all ages may be affected. Cats with conformational (breed or malformation) characteristics, such as short or convoluted nasal passages or very small nostrils, are predisposed to unresolving inflammation. Fungal disease is more relevant in specific geographic regions, making inclusion of a travel history important in history collection. Older cats are more likely to have neoplasia-induced signs.

It provided a unique opportunity to simulate a scenario in which the city-wide air quality improvement during the shutdown was sustained over the five-year period, 2021 through 2025, allowing us to estimate the potential public health benefits to children and adults and their associated economic benefits. We focused on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and modelled potential future health benefits to children and adults. The analysis considered outcomes in children that have not generally been accounted for in clean air benefits assessments, including preterm birth, term low birthweight, infant mortality, child asthma incidence, child asthma hospital admissions and emergency department visits, autism spectrum disorder, as well as adult mortality. We estimated a city-wide 23% improvement in PM2.5 levels during the COVID-19 shutdown months compared to the average level for those months in 2015-2018 (the business as usual period). Based on the data for 2020, we extrapolated the ambient levels of PM2.5 for the following five-year period. The estimated cumulative benefits for 2021-2025 included thousands of avoided cases of illness and death, with associated economic benefits from $31.8 billion to $77 billion. This ""natural experiment,"" tragic though the cause, resulted in a clean air scenario that can be considered aspirational-one that could be achieved through transportation, climate, and environmental policies that support robust economic recovery with similarly reduced emissions.","Perera, Frederica; Berberian, Alique; Cooley, David; Shenaut, Elizabeth; Olmstead, Hollie; Ross, Zev; Matte, Thomas",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33285156/,211

159095,Reply: Coping with Grief and Loss: The Role of Educators During The COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-04-01,"OBJECTIVES Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to assist with mobility and communication is an active area of research in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Implantable BCI offers promise for individuals with severe disease, such as locked-in syndrome, but also raises important ethical issues. We undertook in-depth qualitative interviews with ALS patients from a Veterans Administration hospital ALS multi-disciplinary clinic and explored their perspectives on issues of identity, privacy, enhancement, informed consent, and responsibility related to implantable BCI. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen (n = 16) individuals, and transcripts were analysed using a modified grounded theory approach. RESULTS Emergent themes included: (1) attitudes towards BCI were characterised by fear, hope, and hesitation about adoption of BCI technology; (2) analogies to other technologies were a useful tool in understanding and communicating opinions about ethical issues in BCI; (3) concerns about potentially socially stigmatising effects of BCI and the burden of adjustment to new therapeutic devices were important considerations to be weighed against the potential functional benefit of BCI use; (4) therapeutic decision-making in ALS often intimately involves loved ones; and (5) prospective decision-making about BCI was significantly affected by weighing the timing of the intervention with the progression of illness. CONCLUSION The interest in BCI and views on ethical issues raised by BCI is moderated by the experience of living with ALS. The findings from this study can help guide the development of implantable BCI technology for persons with ALS. Implications for rehabilitation Loved ones will play crucial roles in helping patients think through the possible benefits and burdens of getting a BCI device. Providers should consider how the ideal timing for getting an implantable BCI device will vary based on the priorities of persons with ALS and their disease stage. Concerns about social stigma, burden of adjustment, and the desire to maximise time left with loved ones may outweigh the potential functional benefits of BCI devices for some persons with ALS.","Versalovic, Erika; Diamond, Melissa; Klein, Eran",Disability and rehabilitation.

However, the existence of tumor immune escape and low specificity, limit the application of cancer immunotherapy. Nanocarriers with unique physiochemical properties are now being widely used for improving the anti-tumor effect of multiple cancer immunotherapeutic agents by offering alternate pharmacokinetics profile, site-specific delivery, and an enhanced cellular uptake. Nanocarriers can be engineered to target immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments to restore anti-tumor immune responses. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of immune escape and how nanotechnology is applied to circumvent immunotolerance and improve anti-tumor immunotherapeutic effects. Perspectives on the rationale for designing nanocarriers-based cancer immunotherapy are also provided.","Ma, Yan; Shen, Yue; Zhu, Bin; Li, Dan; Liu, Jiyong",Die Pharmazie,https://doi.org/10.1691/ph.2020.0040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305719/,211

The outbreak of this disease in different countries, including Iran, has caused a lot of concern. In addition to the dangers it poses to human health, the spread of the virus has become a major challenge and a stressful test, putting additional pressure on these countries. Every step in the coming school year offers an opportunity for an ongoing two-way conversation with your child. Listen carefully to what they say and be careful not to burden them with your fears. Giving voice to concerns means sharing them so no one is holding their worries alone, and remember, kids' development is fluid and many kids can make up for lost time, academically and socially. Humans are resilient. Therefore, if schools do not open - or close their doors - it is important to be hopeful and positive about the future, despite everything that is currently being missed or delayed, whether academic or social.","Kamran, Aziz; Naeim, Mahdi",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000001313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764953/,211
161473,800 000 South Sudanese to lose access to health care.,2021-05-29,"Background: Parent-child interaction therapy refers to a group of interventions mediated by trained parents to address areas of developmental difficulties in children. In the field of speech and language therapy it is used in early intervention for children with speech, language and communication difficulties. The intervention involves training parents and caregivers on the importance of responsivity and language input in daily interactions and coaches them on strategies to implement these with the children. As the success of the intervention is heavily influenced by caregiver engagement, understanding and acceptance, it is important to consider their views. However, to date there has been limited work on synthesising parental views of this intervention. Methods: This is a protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis of peer-reviewed qualitative papers addressing the experiences and perceptions of parent-child interaction therapy for parents of children with communication difficulties. We will complete a systematic search of 11 databases, review the reference lists and complete a cited reference search of all included studies. Two authors will independently screen tests for inclusion, initially by title and abstract, with full-text screening as necessary. Thematic synthesis will be used for all included studies. We will appraise the quality of included studies using CASP and confidence in the review findings using GRADE CERQual. Discussion: As the views of parents are pivotal in the success of this intervention, the findings from this synthesis should help to guide best practice and policy for the future implementation of parent child interaction therapy for children with communication difficulties..","O'Toole, Ciara; Lyons, Rena; Ó'Doibhlín, Donna; O'Farrell, Fia; Houghton, Catherine",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.12974.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566893/,211

As of June 2021, almost 175 million people were affected worldwide. Symptom-wise, it is very difficult to diagnose if a person has Covid or just a viral infection. But, taking a close look at chest X-Rays is extremely helpful in the diagnostic process. The proposed methodology in this paper helps in classification of chest X-Ray images into 3 categories: ‘Covid’, ‘Viral’ and ‘Normal’. The dataset was created by integrating 3 pre-existing evergrowing datasets and the ResNet-18 model was adopted to train it. The experimental results show that the classification of the chest X-Ray images was done with an accuracy of 0.9648. An adversarial machine learning approach was employed to poison the train data after which the classification accuracy dropped to 0.8711. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Menon, K.; Bohra, V.

Reported mortality in sepsis ranges from 30%-45%. This study was designed to determine the safety preliminary efficacy of allogenic apoptotic cells administered for immunomodulation in septic patients. Methods. The primary aim of this phase IB study was to determine the safety profile of apoptotic cell infusion in subjects presenting to the emergency room with sepsis. Sepsis was determined by clinical infections and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores >2. The secondary aims were to measure organ dysfunction, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and mortality, that were compared to historical controls. Exploratory endpoints included measuring immune modulator agents to elucidate the mechanism of action using Luminex(R) analysis. Findings. Ten patients were treated with apoptotic cells, administered as a single dose or two sequential doses. All 10 patients had mild-to-moderate sepsis with a SOFA score range of 2-6 upon entering the study. No serious adverse events (SAEs) and no related AEs were reported. All 10 study subjects survived while matched historical controls had a mortality rate of 27%. The study subjects exhibited rapid resolution of organ dysfunction and had significantly shorter ICU lengths of stay compared to matched historical controls (p<0.0001). All patients had both elevated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and additional immune modulators that gradually decreased following treatment. Interpretation. Administration of apoptotic cells to patients with mild-to-moderate sepsis was safe and had a significant immuno-modulating effect, leading to early resolution of the cytokine storm.

171229,Mental Health Gap Action Programme training in Nigeria: Reflections for progressive learning among primary care workers,2021,"Exclusive stochastic gene choice combines precision with diversity. This regulation enables most T-cells to express exactly one T-cell receptor isoform chosen from a large repertoire, and to react precisely against diverse antigens. Some cells express two receptor isoforms, revealing the stochastic nature of this process. A similar regulation of odorant receptors and protocadherins enable cells to recognize odors and confer individuality to cells in neuronal interaction networks, respectively. We explored whether genes in other families are expressed exclusively by analyzing single cell RNA-seq data with a simple metric. Chromosomal segments and families are more likely to express genes concurrently than exclusively, possibly due to the evolutionary and biophysical aspects of shared regulation. Nonetheless, gene families with exclusive gene choice were detected in multiple cell types, most of them are membrane proteins involved in ion transport and cell adhesion, suggesting the coordination of these two functions. Thus, stochastic exclusive expression extends beyond the prototypical families, permitting precision in gene choice to be combined with the diversity of intercellular interactions.","Iakovlev, Mikhail; Faravelli, Simone; Becskei, Attila",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.264747,211

There is little research about psychiatric complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.ObjectivesThe aim of the study was to describe the psychiatric clinical profile and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) unit.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional retrospective study, carried out at a tertiary hospital in Spain, in inpatients admitted because of COVID-19 and referred to our CLP Unit from March 17,2020 to April 28,2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The patients were divided in three groups depending on psychiatric diagnosis: delirium, severe mental illness (SMI) and non-severe mental illness (NSMI).ResultsOf 71 patients included (median [ICR] age 64 [54-73] years;70.4% male), 35.2% had a delirium, 18.3% had a SMI, and 46.5% had a NSMI. Compared to patients with delirium and NSMI, patients with SMI were younger, more likely to be institutionalized and were administered less anti-COVID19 drugs. Mortality was higher among patients with delirium (21.7%) than those with SMI (0%) or NSMI (9.45%). The rate of side effects due to interactions between anti-COVID19 and psychiatric drugs was low, mainly drowsiness (4.3%) and borderline QTc prolongation (1.5%).ConclusionsPatients affected by SMI were more often undertreated for COVID-19. However, the rate of interactions was very low, and avoidable with a proper evaluation and drug-dose adjustment. Half of the patients with SMI were institutionalized, suggesting that living conditions in residential facilities could make them more vulnerable to infection.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Arbelo, N.; Sagué, M.; López-Pelayo, H.; Madero, S.; Pinzón-Espinosa, J.; Anmella, G.; Gomes-Da-Costa, S.; Ilzarbe, L.; Llach, C.; Cámara, M.; Imaz, M.

174471,The role of research in evaluating and implementing digital mental health: Lecture title,2021,"Much work has considered the evolution of pathogens, but little is known about how they respond to changes in host behaviour. We build a model where hosts are able to choose to engage in prophylactic measures that reduce the likelihood of disease transmission. This choice is mediated by costs and benefits associated with prophylaxis, but the fraction of hosts engaged in prophylaxis is also affected by population dynamics. We identify a critical cost threshold above which hosts do not engage in prophylaxis. Below the threshold, prophylactic host behaviour does occur and pathogen virulence, measured by the extent to which it exploits its host, is reduced by the action of selection relative to the level that would otherwise be predicted in the absence of prophylaxis. Our work emphasizes the significance of the dual nature of the trade-off faced by the pathogen between balancing transmission and recovery, and creating new infections in hosts engaging or not engaging in prophylaxis.","Mitchell, Evan; Wild, Geoff",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.881383,211

We simulated the transferring of virulence and antibiotic-resistance genes in a community of interacting people where some take antibiotics. The diversities of the two genes types became positively correlated whenever the contagion probability between two people was higher than the probability of losing resistant genes. However, no such positive correlations arise if no one takes antibiotics. This finding holds even under changes of several simulations’ parameters, such as the relative or total diversity of virulence and resistance genes, the contagion probability between individuals, the loss rate of resistance genes, or the social network type. Because the loss rate of resistance genes may be shallow, we conclude that the contagion between people and antibiotic usage is the leading cause of establishing the positive correlation mentioned above. Therefore, antibiotic use and something as prosaic as the contagion between people may facilitate the emergence of virulent and multi-resistant bacteria in people’s metagenomes with a high diversity of both gene types. These superbugs may then circulate in the community.","Domingues, Célia P.

176274,Discussion of Mental Illness and Mental Health By NBA Players on Twitter,2020-10-21,"Background In April 2020, formal face-face cardiology training was put on pause due to COVID-19. We adapted by utilising a video-conferencing platform to continue some form of Cardiology education on a national scale, and maintain morale. This programme, known as CardioWebinar, has continued ever since. We looked to study the effectiveness of delivering virtual Cardiology education 1 year into the COVID pandemic. Methods Expert speakers throughout the UK were sought after via social media and 'word of mouth.' Weekly webinars were organised and advertised (Canva posters) on social media (Twitter), as well as via the British Cardiovascular Society and British Junior Cardiologists' Association (BJCA) media links. Each webinar was scheduled mid-week at 17:30 (UK). Interested attendees registered for free using an online ticketing platform (Eventbrite). Webinars were delivered using an online video conferencing platform (Zoom) which required a £14.99 monthly subscription. Each webinar consisted of a 40-minute presentation followed by Q&A (20mins). All webinars were recorded and later accessible for free on the BJCA TV Gallery. A Learning Management System (LMS) was used to collect feedback after each session and generate certificates of attendance for attendee appraisal. We systematically reviewed the LMS feedback of live attendees from 6 consecutive webinars delivered between Jan- Feb 2021. We further surveyed our most recent (March 2021) attendees (145 participants) via an extended questionnaire through the LMS exploring their experiences of our virtual education. Results 55 CardioWebinars have been delivered since April 2020. The speakers have been predominantly Consultant Cardiologists from the UK. Some of the recordings have had &gt;1000 views. Other than the video platform subscription, no cost was incurred in the delivery of this entire programme. We collected feedback from 392 respondents (∼65 live attendees per webinar) from each session between Jan- Feb 2021. The sessions were rated as 'very good-excellent' by 97%. We collected a further 145 responses from March 2021 attendees to an extended questionnaire. 90% rated the whole series as 'very good -excellent' in supporting their cardiology education during the Covid pandemic, and 84% felt the programme sufficiently covered even the more challenging areas of the Cardiology curriculum (e.g aortopathies). 90% of the respondents felt that their work-life schedule allowed them to join the live webinars at this time. The respondents where predominantly from the UK (91%), though included an international audience (9%). Whilst 74% of attendees were cardiology trainees, the remaining 26% included physiologists, nursing staff, consultants and other junior doctors. 99% felt that virtual education should continue to play a formal part in their training after the COVID pandemic. Conclusion Webinars allow everyone interested in cardiac care across the world the opportunity to hear experts teach, and without a travel cost. They are cheap and easy to organise. Whilst the 'social' aspect of training is limited, this study suggests that webinars will remain an integral part of the post- Covid era.","Luther, V.; Kailey, B.; Dev, D.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.79,211
177494,Understanding the pandemic experience for people with a preexisting mental health disorder,2021,"Background The epitranscriptomic writer Alkylation Repair Homolog 8 (ALKBH8) is a tRNA methyltransferase that modifies the wobble uridine of selenocysteine tRNA to promote the specialized translation, via stop codon recoding, of proteins that contain selenocysteine. Corresponding selenoproteins play critical roles in protecting against reactive oxygen species and environmental stress. Using a novel animal model deficient in Alkbh8, we have investigated the importance of epitranscriptomic systems in the response to naphthalene (NA), an abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, glutathione depleter and lung toxicant found in tobacco smoke, gasoline and mothballs. Objectives Our goal was to define the molecular reprogramming of Alkbh8 deficient (Alkbh8def) mice and evaluate the roles that the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 and selenoproteins play in mitigating NA-induced toxicity and lung dysfunction. Methods We performed basal lung analysis and NA exposure studies using WT, Alkbh8def and Cyp2abfgs-null mice, the latter of which lack the cytochrome P450 enzymes required for NA bioactivation. We characterized gene expression, molecular markers of damage, viability and tolerance to NA. Results Under basal conditions, lungs from Alkbh8def mice have increased oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and 8-isoprostane levels, and have reprogrammed at the molecular level to display increased stress response transcripts. In addition, the ALKBH8 writer deficient lungs have a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio. Alkbh8def mice are more sensitive to NA than WT, showing higher susceptibility to lung damage both at the cellular and molecular levels. WT mice develop a tolerance to NA after 3 days, defined as resistance to a high challenging dose after repeated exposures, which is absent in Alkbh8def mice, with writer deficient not surviving NA exposure. Discussion We conclude that the epitranscriptomic writer ALKBH8 plays a protective role against NA-induced lung dysfunction and promotes NA tolerance. Our work provides an early example of how epitranscriptomic systems can regulate the response to environmental stress in vivo.","Leonardi, Andrea; Kovalchuk, Nataliia; Yin, Lei; Endres, Lauren; Evke, Sara; Nevins, Steven; Martin, Samuel; Dedon, Peter C.; Melendez, J.

179156,The power of representation and lived experience,2021,"As the COVID-19 epidemic began to worsen in the first months of 2020, stringent lockdown policies were implemented in numerous cities throughout the world to control human transmission and mitigate its spread. Although transportation density reduction inside the city was felt subjectively, there has thus far been no objective and quantitative study of its variation to reflect the intracity population flows and their corresponding relationship with lockdown policy stringency from the view of remote sensing images with the high resolution under 1m. Accordingly, we here provide a quantitative investigation of the transportation density reduction before and after lockdown was implemented in six epicenter cities (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, Paris, New York, and London) around the world during the COVID-19 epidemic, which is accomplished by extracting vehicles from the multi-temporal high-resolution remote sensing images. A novel vehicle detection model combining unsupervised vehicle candidate extraction and deep learning identification was specifically proposed for the images with the resolution of 0.5m. Our results indicate that transportation densities were reduced by an average of approximately 50% (and as much as 75.96%) in these six cities following lockdown. The influences on transportation density reduction rates are also highly correlated with policy stringency, with an R^2 value exceeding 0.83. Even within a specific city, the transportation density changes differed and tended to be distributed in accordance with the city's land-use patterns. Considering that public transportation was mostly reduced or even forbidden, our results indicate that city lockdown policies are effective at limiting human transmission within cities.","Wu, Chen; Zhu, Sihan; Yang, Jiaqi; Hu, Meiqi; Du, Bo; Zhang, Liangpei; Zhang, Lefei; Han, Chengxi; Lan, Meng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01717v1.pdf,211

The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, a unique 7-amino-acid deletion mutation in the N-terminal domain of the Lambda spike protein, is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies. Since the Lambda variant has dominantly spread according to the increasing frequency of the isolates harboring the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, our data suggest that the insertion of the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation is closely associated with the massive infection spread of the Lambda variant in South America.

189163,Improving Transition from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to Adult Mental Health Services for Adolescents in Transition to Young Adulthood: A Literature Review.,2020-09-01,"Conventional and molecular epidemiologic studies have confirmed the ability of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to rapidly evolve and successfully circumvent extensive vaccination programs implemented since the early 1950s. IBV evolution has often been explained as variation in gene frequencies as if evolution were driven by genetic drift alone. However, the mechanisms regulating the evolution of IBV include both the generation of genetic diversity and the selection process. IBV's generation of genetic diversity has been extensively investigated and ultimately involves mutations and recombination events occurring during viral replication. The relevance of the selection process has been further understood more recently by identifying genetic and phenotypic differences between IBV populations prior to, and during, replication in the natural host. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple environmental forces within the host, including immune responses (or lack thereof) and affinity for cell receptors, as well as physical and biochemical conditions, are responsible for the selection process. Some scientists have used or adopted the related quasispecies frame to explain IBV evolution. The quasispecies frame, while providing a distinct explanation of the dynamics of populations in which mutation is a frequent event, exhibits relevant limitations which are discussed herein. Instead, it seems that IBV populations evolving by the generation of genetic variability and selection on replicons follow the evolutionary mechanisms originally proposed by Darwin. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the evolution of IBV is of basic relevance and, without doubt, essential to appropriately control and prevent the disease.","Toro, Haroldo; van Santen, Vicky L; Jackwood, Mark W",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23050459/,211

Partial genomic sequence analysis showed that these isolates had the S-3-M-5-N gene order that is typical of avian coronaviruses. The spike, membrane and nucleocapsid protein genes of pf/CH/LKQ3/03 had >99 % identity to those of the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus H120 vaccine strain (Massachusetts serotype) and other Massachusetts serotype isolates. Furthermore, when pf/CH/LKQ3/03 was inoculated experimentally into chickens (specific-pathogen-free), no disease signs were apparent. tl/CH/LDT3/03 had a spike protein gene with 95 % identity to that of a Chinese infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolate, although more extensive sequencing revealed the possibility that this strain may have undergone recombination. When inoculated into chickens, tl/CH/LDT3/03 resulted in the death of birds from nephritis. Taken together, this information suggests that pf/CH/LKQ3/03 might be a revertant, attenuated vaccine IBV strain, whereas tl/CH/LDT3/03 is a nephropathogenic field IBV strain, generated through recombination. The replication and non-pathogenic nature of IBV in domestic peafowl and teal under field conditions raises questions as to the role of these hosts as carriers of IBV and the potential that they may have to transmit virus to susceptible chicken populations.","Liu, Shengwang; Chen, Jianfei; Chen, Jinding; Kong, Xiangang; Shao, Yuhao; Han, Zongxi; Feng, Li; Cai, Xuehui; Gu, Shoulin; Liu, Ming",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15722532/,211
193777,Attitudes to living and working in pandemic conditions among emergency prehospital medical care personnel.,2010,"Scientific knowledge of ostrich diseases is incomplete and very fragmented, with specific details on technical aspects of diagnostic and/or screening tests completely absent in most cases. Salmonella Typhimurium is common in multispecies collections and causes mortality in chicks younger than three months on commercial farms, but is rarely found in chicks older than six months, or slaughter birds of twelve to fourteen months in southern Africa. Campylobacter jejuni and Chlamydia psittaci are occasionally reported, mainly in young ostriches, but both remain a diagnostic challenge. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is transmitted to domestic animals including ostriches, principally by ticks of the genus Hyalomma. In the ostrich, the disease causes no clinical symptoms during a viraemia of approximately four days. Spongiform encephalopathy has not been reliably reported in ostriches, while anthrax has occurred rarely in modern times but was reportedly an important cause of death approximately 100 years ago in South Africa. Salmonella Gallinarum and S. Pullorum are unknown in ostriches. Pasteurella multocida occurs but is easily contained with antibiotics. Mycoplasma spp. are regularly found in an upper respiratory disease syndrome complicated by opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Ostriches of all ages are susceptible to challenge by velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV), but standard inactivated La Sota poultry vaccines can stimulate protective immunity lasting over six months. The viraemic period in vaccinated slaughter ostriches is between nine and eleven days and there are no indications of a carrier state or presence of the virus in the meat or any other tissues after this period, with peak immunoglobulin G response reached on day fourteen post infection. Haemagglutination inhibition tests are significantly less sensitive and less specific than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cloacal and choanal swabs used for direct virological screening in clinically affected cases (field and experimental) could not detect NDV. All avian influenza isolates reported from ostriches have been non-pathogenic to poultry, even the H5 and H7 subtypes. Some of the latter have been associated with mortality of ostrich chicks in localised outbreaks during periods of inclement weather and with significant wild bird (waterfowl) contact. Borna disease causes a nervous syndrome in ostrich chicks, but to date, has only been reported in Israel. Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitides cause fatal disease in ostriches and other ratites, with mortality ranging from less than 20% to over 80% in affected flocks. These diseases are present in North, Central and South America where the associated ornithophilic mosquito vectors occur. Equine and human vaccines are apparently safe and efficacious in ratites. Wesselsbron disease, infectious bursal disease (type 2), adenovirus and coronavirus infections have been reported from ostriches but the significance of these diseases is unclear. Due to the paucity of data regarding ostrich diseases and the unvalidated state of most poultry tests in this unique group of birds, strict observation of a pre-slaughter quarantine of thirty days is strongly advised, whilst live exports and fertile eggs should be screened through the additional use of sentinel chickens and/or young ostriches.","Verwoerd, D J",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10935285/,211

The phosphorylation state and intracellular distribution of TGEV N protein in infected cells were characterized by a combination of techniques including: (i) subcellular fractionation and analysis of tryptic peptides by two-dimensional nano-liquid chromatography, coupled to ion-trap mass spectrometry; (ii) tandem mass-spectrometry analysis of N protein resolved by SDS-PAGE; (iii) Western blotting using two specific antisera for phosphoserine-containing motifs; and (iv) confocal microscopy. A total of four N protein-derived phosphopeptides were detected in mitochondria-Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-enriched fractions, including N-protein phosphoserines 9, 156, 254 and 256. Confocal microscopy showed that the N protein found in mitochondria-Golgi-ERGIC fractions localized within the Golgi-ERGIC compartments and not with mitochondria. Phosphorylated N protein was also present in purified virions, containing at least phosphoserines 156 and 256. Coronavirus N proteins showed a conserved pattern of secondary structural elements, including six beta-strands and four alpha-helices. Whilst serine 9 was present in a non-conserved domain, serines 156, 254 and 256 were localized close to highly conserved secondary structural elements within the central domain of coronavirus N proteins. Serine 156 was highly conserved, whereas no clear homologous sites were found for serines 254 and 256 for other coronavirus N proteins.","Calvo, E; Escors, D; López, J A; González, J M; Alvarez, A; Arza, E; Enjuanes, L",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16033973/,211

198493,Ageing and psychological response during the post-SARS period.,2006,"Gene therapy is a promising approach, yet so far it has shown limited effectiveness in many clinical trials, mainly due to insufficient gene transduction. Recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) has been well developed as a gene delivery vector, initially for protein expression in mammalian cells. rVV has been further developed to express antigens in vivo in generating immunity for protection against specific infectious diseases and cancer. rVVs, as non-replicating viral vectors, have been demonstrated for their great potential as vaccines, for their diminished cytopathic effects, high levels of protein expression and strong immunogenicity, and they are relatively safe in animals and in human patients. A number of clinical trials using rVVs as vaccines have shown promising results for treating infectious diseases and cancer. In the last few years, due to its exceptional ability to replicate in tumour cells, the Western Reserve strain vaccinia has been explored as a replicating oncolytic virus for cancer virotherapy. As more is learned about the functions of viral gene products in controlling the mammalian cell cycle and in disabling cellular defence mechanisms, specific viral functions can be augmented or eliminated to enhance antitumour efficacy and improve tumour cell targeting. General mechanisms by which this oncolytic virus achieves the antitumour efficacy and specificity are reviewed. Specifically, the deletion of the viral genes for thymidine kinase and vaccinia growth factor resulted in a vaccinia mutant with enhanced tumour targeting activity and fully retaining its efficiency of replication in cancer cells. Other potential strategies for improving this vector for gene delivery will also be discussed in this review.","Guo, Z Sheng; Bartlett, David L",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15174972/,211
198958,Excess Deaths Among Blacks and Latinx Compared to Whites During Covid-19,2021,"Inefficient adenoviral vector (AdV)-mediated gene transfer to the ciliated respiratory epithelium has hindered gene transfer strategies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis lung disease. In part, the inefficiency is due to an absence of the coxsackie B and adenovirus type 2 and 5 receptor (CAR) from the apical membranes of polarized epithelia. In this study, using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium, we show that providing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked AdV receptor (GPI-CAR) at the apical surface did not significantly improve AdV gene transfer efficiency because the lumenal surface glycocalyx limited the access of AdV to apical GPI-CAR. The highly glycosylated tethered mucins were considered to be significant glycocalyx components that restricted AdV access because proteolytic digestion and inhibitors of O-linked glycosylation enhanced AdV gene transfer. To determine whether these in vitro observations are relevant to the in vivo situation, we generated transgenic mice expressing GPI-CAR at the surface of the airway epithelium, crossbred these mice with mice that were genetically devoid of tethered mucin type 1 (Muc1), and tested the efficiency of gene transfer to murine airways expressing apical GPI-human CAR (GPI-hCAR) in the presence and absence of Muc1. We determined that AdV gene transfer to the murine airway epithelium was inefficient even in GPI-hCAR transgenic mice but that the gene transfer efficiency improved in the absence of Muc1. However, the inability to achieve a high gene transfer efficiency, even in mice with a deletion of Muc1, suggested that other glycocalyx components, possibly other tethered mucin types, also provide a significant barrier to AdV interacting with the airway lumenal surface.","Stonebraker, Jaclyn R; Wagner, Danielle; Lefensty, Robert W; Burns, Kimberlie; Gendler, Sandra J; Bergelson, Jeffrey M; Boucher, Richard C; O'Neal, Wanda K; Pickles, Raymond J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564484/,211

A study was undertaken to investigate the time required for the ciliated epithelium to return to normal following bronchiolitis in infants treated with inhaled steroids or placebo. METHODS Thirty one previously healthy term infants were studied as part of a clinical trial to determine the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with inhaled fluticasone (FP) or placebo via a spacer device (17 FP, 14 placebo). Nineteen healthy children aged 0-6 years previously studied in our department were used as controls. Nasal biopsy specimens were taken from infants with bronchiolitis and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured before treatment and repeated 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks later. The epithelial ultrastructure was examined by transmission electron microscopy and a normal errors mixed model based on normal controls was used to examine the time for cilia to return to normal in bronchiolitic infants. RESULTS The mean CBF of infants with bronchiolitis (in Hz) at weeks 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 were 0.5 (n = 4), 10.9 (n = 4), 12.0 (n = 9), 11.9 (n = 8), and 12.1 (n = 7) in the placebo group and 10.6 (n = 6), 11.4 (n = 9), 8.8 (n = 8), 10.9 (n = 4), and 13.2 (n = 7) in the FP group. The time for the epithelial ultrastructure to normalise was as follows: epithelial integrity score (13.1 weeks), % ciliated cells with loss of cilia (14.0 weeks), and % epithelial cells with abnormalities in projection (16.7 weeks) or mitochondria (15.9 weeks). Inhaled steroids had no significant effects on CBF or epithelial ultrastructure. CONCLUSION Ciliary loss and epithelial abnormalities persist on average for 13-17 weeks following acute bronchiolitis in infancy.","Wong, J Y W; Rutman, A; O'Callaghan, C",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15994267/,211

Nevertheless prolonged IL-6 exposition activates apoptosis. According to recent studies increased levels of IL-6 increase cardiovascular disease risks. The aim of the study was to explore IL-6 basic levels in chronic congestive heart failure patients, as in risk group in COVID-19, and various factors (demographic or clinical) in various groups of IL-6 basic levels. We used consecutive sampling approach to recruit 96 congestive heart failure patients and 34 persons without the condition as controls. Hematologic, biochemical and immunologic parameters were measured using conventional methods. We used descriptive statistics for demographic parameters. We compared mean values of hematologic and biochemical parameters in cases and controls using independent sample t test and explored differences within the congestive heart failure group (further separated in 3 groups according to IL-6 levels) using one way ANOVA test, with further post-hoc analysis. Levels of IL-6 are statistically significantly higher in CHF patients; groups differ in co-morbidity, also abdominal obesity is more prevalent in diseased group. Difference between groups is significant in a number of pro-inflammation, coagulation, hematology parameters. It is also important to note that the CHF group showed a number of differences in sub-groups according to IL-6 levels, risks of CHF and comorbidity deterioration risks therefore are suggested to be different.","Gulatava, N; Tabagari, N; Talakvadze, T; Nadareishvili, I; Tabagari, S",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395641/,211
199931,"Antidepressants, primary care, and adult mental health services in England during COVID-19",2021,"Human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly type 16 (HPV-16), is present in more than 99% of cervical cancers. The HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are constantly expressed and therefore represent ideal targets for HPV vaccine development. We previously developed DNA vaccines encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to HPV-16 E7 and generated potent E7-specific CD8(+) T-cell immune responses and antitumor effects against an E7-expressing tumor. Since vaccines targeting E6 also represent an important strategy for controlling HPV-associated lesions, we developed a DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to E6 (CRT/E6). Our results indicated that the CRT/E6 DNA vaccine, but not a wild-type E6 DNA vaccine, generated significant E6-specific CD8(+) T-cell immune responses in vaccinated mice. Mapping of the immunodominant epitope of E6 revealed that an E6 peptide comprising amino acids (aa) 48 to 57 (E6 aa48-57), presented by H-2K(b), is the optimal peptide and that the region of E6 comprising aa 50 to 57 represents the minimal core sequence required for activating E6-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes. We also demonstrated that E6 aa48-57 contains cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes naturally presented by E6-expressing TC-1 cells. Vaccination with a CRT/E6 but not a CRT/mtE6 (lacking aa 50 to 57 of E6) DNA vaccine could protect vaccinated mice from challenge with E6-expressing TC-1 tumors. Thus, our data indicate that E6 aa48-57 contains the immunodominant epitope and that a CRT/E6 DNA vaccine may be useful for control of HPV infection and HPV-associated lesions.","Peng, Shiwen; Ji, Hongxiu; Trimble, Cornelia; He, Liangmei; Tsai, Ya-Chea; Yeatermeyer, Jessica; Boyd, David A K; Hung, Chien-Fu; Wu, T-C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15280455/,211

This article review refers to the roles of Ginkgo Biloba to reduce the risk of infection in the respiratory tract, the details on the epidemiology of corona COVID-19 and influenza, and it highlights how the Ginko Biloba could have been used as a novel treatment.Ginkgo Biloba can reduce the risk of infection by several mechanisms; these mechanisms involve Ginkgo Biloba contains quercetin and other constituents, which have anti-inflammatory and immune modulator effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations. Cytokines cause inflammation which have been induced the injuries in lung lining.Some observational studies confirmed that Ginkgo Biloba reduced the risk of asthma, sepsis and another respiratory disease as well as it reduced the risk of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms. While other evidences suggested the characters of Ginkgo Biloba as an antivirus agent through several mechanisms. Ginkgolic acid (GA) can inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins, thus, it inhibit the Herpes Simplex Virus type1 (HSV-1), genome replication in Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the infections of the Zika Virus (ZIKV). Also, it inhibits the wide spectrum of fusion by inhibiting the three types of proteins that have been induced fusion as (Influenza A Virus [IAV], Epstein Barr Virus [EBV], HIV and Ebola Virus [EBOV]).The secondary mechanism of GA targeting inhibition of the DNA and protein synthesis in virus, greatly have been related to its strong effects, even afterward the beginning of the infection, therefore, it potentially treats the acute viral contaminations like (Measles and Coronavirus COVID-19). Additionally, it has been used topically as an effective agent on vigorous lesions including (varicella-zoster virus [VZV], HSV-1 and HSV-2). Ginkgo Biloba may be useful for treating the infected people with coronavirus COVID-19 through its beneficial effect. To assess those recommendations should be conducted with random control trials and extensive population studies.","Ibrahim, Manal A; Ramadan, Hanan H; Mohammed, Rasha N",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,,211

However, the mental health challenges and complexities faced by hospital staff in the United States has not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we conducted this study to examine the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among hospital staff in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The design is a single-center, cross-sectional, online survey evaluating depression and anxiety among all hospital employees (n = 3,500) at a safety-net hospital with a moderate cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate between April 30-May 22, 2020. We assessed depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to identify associations with depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Of 3,500 hospital employees, 1,246 (36%) responded to the survey. We included 1,232 individuals in the final analysis. Overall, psychological distress was common among the respondents: 21% and 33% of staff reported significant depression and anxiety, respectively, while 46% experienced overwhelming stress due to COVID-19. Notably, staff members overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 were seven and nine times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, respectively. In addition to stress, individuals with six to nine years of work experience were two times more likely to report moderate or severe depression compared to those with 10 or more years of work experience. Moreover, ancillary staff with direct patient contact (odds ratio [OR] 8.9, confidence interval (CI), 1.46, 173.03) as well as administrative and ancillary staff with indirect patient contact (OR 5.9, CI, 1.06, 111.01) were more likely to be depressed than physicians and advanced providers. CONCLUSION: We found that a considerable proportion of staff were suffering from psychological distress. COVID-19-associated depression and anxiety was widespread among hospital staff even in settings with comparatively lower COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Ancillary staff, administrative staff, staff with less job experience, and staff overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 are particularly susceptible to negative mental health outcomes. These findings will help inform hospital policymakers on best practices to develop interventions to reduce the mental health burden associated with COVID-19 in vulnerable hospital staff.","Hassamal, Sameer; Dong, Fanglong; Hassamal, Sunita; Lee, Carol; Ogunyemi, Dotun; Neeki, Michael M",West J Emerg Med,,211

The novel truncated mutation is most closely related to nine SARS-CoV-2 strains found in Washington state. Our results show a novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 with a truncated ORF8 gene. This shortens the translated ORF8 protein.

220294,"Annals of Work Exposures and Health Performance, 2020",2021,"Countries across the world are in different stages of COVID-19 trajectory, among which many have implemented lockdown measures to prevent its spread. Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with the government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement in the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in 1 week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Our results show that lockdown measures are still necessary for several countries. We expect our research can help different countries to make better decisions on the lockdown measures.","Li, Yingxue; Jia, Wenxiao; Wang, Junmei; Guo, Jianying; Liu, Qin; Li, Xiang; Xie, Guotong; Wang, Fei",J Healthc Inform Res,,211

220666,High body mass index and night shift work are associated with COVID-19 in health care workers,2020,"COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in Brazil, a country of continental dimensions, but the incidence of the disease is showing to be very heterogeneous, affecting cities and regions differently. Thus, there is a gap regarding what factors would contribute to accentuate the differences in the incidence of COVID-19 among Brazilian cities. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of altitude on the incidence of COVID-19 in Brazilian cities. We analyzed the relative incidence (RI), the relative death rate (RDR) of COVID-19, and air relative humidity (RH) in all 154 cities in Brazil with a population above 200 thousand inhabitants, located between 5 and 1135 m in altitude. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to compare a relationship between altitude with RI and RDR, and between RH with RI and RDR. Altitudes were classified into three classes [low (altitude &#8804; 97 m a. s. l), middle (97 < altitude &#8804; 795 m a. s. l), high (795 < altitude &#8804; 1135 m a. s. l)] for the RI, RDR, and RH variables. To compare the three classes of altitude, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test were used to compare averages (p < 0.05). Our epidemiological analysis found that the RI, RDR, and RH were lower in cities located in high altitudes (795 < altitude &#8804; 1135 m a. s. l) when compared to the middle (97 < altitude &#8804; 795 m a. s. l) and low (altitude &#8804; 97 m a. s. l) cities altitudes. Furthermore, our study shows that there is a negative correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 with altitude and a positive correlation with RH in the cities analyzed. Brazilian cities with high altitude and low RH have lower RI and RDR from COVID-19. Thus, high altitude cities may be favorable to shelter people at risk. This study may be useful for understanding the behavior of SARS-CoV2, and start point for future studies to establish causality of environmental conditions with SARS-CoV2 contributing to the implementation of measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.","Fernandes, José Sebastião Cunha; da Silva, Ricardo Siqueira; Silva, Alexandre Christófaro; Villela, Daniel Campos; Mendonça, Vanessa Amaral; Lacerda, Ana Cristina Rodrigues",Sci Rep,,211
220903,COVID-19 and paediatric health services: A survey of paediatric physicians in Australia and New Zealand,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to afflict millions of people worldwide. Patients with end-stage heart failure and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) may be at risk for severe COVID-19 given a high prevalence of complex comorbidities and functional impaired immunity. The objective of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with end-stage heart failure and durable LVADs. METHODS: The Trans-CoV-VAD registry is a multi-center registry of LVAD and cardiac transplant patients in the United States with confirmed COVID-19. Patient characteristics, exposure history, presentation, laboratory data, course, and clinical outcomes were collected by participating institutions and reviewed by a central data repository. This report represents the participation of the first 9 centers to report LVAD data into the registry. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were included in this cohort. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 46-68), 14 (35%) were women, and 21 (52%) were Black. Among the most common presenting symptoms were cough (41%), fever, and fatigue (both 38%). A total of 18% were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Only 43% of the patients reported either subjective or measured fever during the entire course of illness. Over half (60%) required hospitalization, and 8 patients (20%) died, often after lengthy hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: We present the largest case series of LVAD patients with COVID-19 to date. Understanding these characteristics is essential in an effort to improve the outcome of this complex patient population.","Birati, Edo Y; Najjar, Samer S; Tedford, Ryan J; Houston, Brian A; Shore, Supriya; Vorovich, Esther; Atluri, Pavan; Urgo, Kimberly; Molina, Maria; Chambers, Susan; Escobar, Nicole; Hsich, Eileen; Estep, Jerry D; Alexander, Kevin M; Teuteberg, Jeffrey J; Chaudhry, Sunit-Preet; Ravichandran, Ashwin; DeVore, Adam D; Margulies, Kenneth B; Hanff, Thomas C; Zimmer, Ross; Kilic, Arman; Wald, Joyce W; Vidula, Himabindu; Martens, John; Blumberg, Emily A; Mazurek, Jeremy A; Owens, Anjali T; Goldberg, Lee R; Alvarez-Garcia, Jesus; Mancini, Donna M; Moss, Noah; Genuardi, Michael V",Circ Heart Fail,,211

METHODS: Single-cell transcriptomic datasets of the early TE as well as the first- and second-trimester placentas have been reported1,2 . Here, we conducted the transcriptomic analysis of 4198 early TE cells, 1260 first-trimester placental cells and 189 EVTs at 24-week placentas (EVT_24W) by SMART-Seq2 method. Immunohistochemical staining of the human first-, second- and third- trimester placentas was performed to confirm bioinformatic results. RESULTS: Via bioinformatic analysis, we identified the existence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in human TE as well as in the first- and second- trimester placentas. In human TE data, 54.4% of TE1 cells, 9.0% of CTBs, 3.2% of EVTs and 29.5% of STBs were ACE2 positive. As for TMPRSS2, 90.7% of TE1 cells, 31.5% of CTBs, 22.1% of EVTs and 70.8% of STBs were TMPRSS2 positive. Amongst the placental cells, 20.4% of CTBs, 44.1% of STBs, 3.4% of EVT_8W and 63% of EVT_24W were ACE2 positive. And 1.6% of CTBs, 26.5% of STBs, 1.9% of EVT_8W and 20.1% of EVT_24W were TMPRSS2 positive. Pathway analysis revealed associations to morphogenesis of branching structure, extracellular matrix interaction, oxygen binding and antioxidant activity in ACE2+TMPRSS2+ EVT_24W cells. The ACE2+TMPRSS2+ TE1 cells were correlated with an increased capacity of viral invasion, epithelial cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Based on immunohistochemical results, expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in first- and second- and third-trimester placentas was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 positive cells in the human TE and placentas at different stages of pregnancy, which indicates the possibility that the SARS-CoV-2 could spread via the placenta and cause intrauterine fetal infection.

Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging. While outpatient eating disorder services in Canada have attempted to transition to virtual care, guidelines related to optimal virtual care in this field are lacking. As such, the objective of our Canadian Consensus Panel was to develop clinical practice guidelines related to the provision of virtual care for children, adolescents, and emerging adults living with an eating disorder, as well as their caregivers, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: Using scoping review methodology (with literature in databases from 2000 to 2020 and grey literature from 2010 to 2020), the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation tool, and a panel of diverse stakeholders from across Canada, we developed high quality treatment guidelines that are focused on virtual interventions for children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, and their caregivers. RESULTS: Strong recommendations were supported specifically in favour of in-person medical evaluation when necessary for children, adolescents, and emerging adults, and that equity-seeking groups and marginalized youth should be provided equal access to treatment. For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT. For emerging adults, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help was strongly recommended. Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Several gaps for future work were identified including the impact of sex, gender, race, and socioeconomic status on virtual care among children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, as well as research on more intensive services, such as virtual day hospitals.","Couturier, Jennifer; Pellegrini, Danielle; Miller, Catherine; Bhatnagar, Neera; Boachie, Ahmed; Bourret, Kerry; Brouwers, Melissa; Coelho, Jennifer S; Dimitropoulos, Gina; Findlay, Sheri; Ford, Catherine; Geller, Josie; Grewal, Seena; Gusella, Joanne; Isserlin, Leanna; Jericho, Monique; Johnson, Natasha; Katzman, Debra K; Kimber, Melissa; Lafrance, Adele; Leclerc, Anick; Loewen, Rachel; Loewen, Techiya; McVey, Gail; Norris, Mark; Pilon, David; Preskow, Wendy; Spettigue, Wendy; Steinegger, Cathleen; Waite, Elizabeth; Webb, Cheryl",J Eat Disord,,211

RESULTS: The databases CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBM were searched from inception until July 2018. Two appropriately-trained reviewers screened and extracted articles independently. The ARRIVE guidelines were used to assess the quality of the published reports of animal experiments. The compliance rate of every item was analyzed relative to their date of publication. A total of 4342 studies were included, of which 73.0% had been cited &#8804;5 times. Only 29.0% (1261/4342) were published in journals listed in the Chinese Science Citation Database. The results indicate that the compliance rate of approximately half of the sub-items (51.3%, 20/39) was less than 50%, of which 65.0% (13/20) was even less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS: The reporting quality of animal experiments in Chinese journals is not at a high level. Following publication of the ARRIVE guidelines in 2010, the compliance rate of the majority of its requirements has improved to some extent. However, less attention has been paid to the ethics and welfare of experimental animals, and a number of specific items in the Methods, Results, and Discussion sections continue to not be reported in sufficient detail. Therefore, it is necessary to popularize the ARRIVE guidelines, advocate researchers to adhere to them in the future, and in particular promote the use of the guidelines in specialized journals in order that the design, implementation, and reporting of animal experiments is promoted, to ultimately improve their quality.","Zhao, Bing; Jiang, Yanbiao; Zhang, Ting; Shang, Zhizhong; Zhang, Weiyi; Hu, Kaiyan; Chen, Fei; Mei, Fan; Gao, Qianqian; Zhao, Li; Kwong, Joey S W; Ma, Bin",BMC Vet Res,,211
227182,Implementing the Collaborative Chronic Care Model in Mental Health Clinics: Achieving and Sustaining Clinical Effects,2021,"This paper demonstrates that transportation networks may be used to assess and predict the regional risk of COVID-19 infection from the outbreak. We use China's high-speed rail (HSR) network at the scale of prefecture level to assess, based on a probabilistic risk model, the risk of COVID-19 infection from Wuhan to the country's 31 province-level regions at the early stage of domestic spread. We find that the high-risk regions are mainly distributed along the southern half of Beijing-Hong Kong HSR line, where a large number of infection cases have been confirmed at the early stage. Furthermore, the two components of the infection risk, namely, the probability (proxied by the region's correlation with Wuhan through HSR) and the impact (proxied by the region's population with mobility), can play different roles in the risk ranking for different regions. For public health administrators, these findings may be used for better decision making, including the preparation of emergency plans and supplies, and the allocation of limited resources, before the extensive spread of the epidemic. Moreover, the administrators should adopt different intervention measures for different regions, so as to better mitigate the epidemic spread according to their own risk scenarios with respect to the probability of occurring and, once occurred, the impact.","Li, Tao; Rong, Lili; Zhang, Anming",,,211

Compelling experimental evidence indicates that face conveys plenty of information that are fundamental for humans to interact. These are encoded at neural level in specific cortical and subcortical brain regions through activity- and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity processes. The current pandemic, due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, is causing relevant social and psychological detrimental effects. The institutional recommendations on physical distancing, namely social distancing and wearing of facemasks are effective in reducing the rate of viral spread. However, by impacting social interaction, facemasks might impair the neural responses to recognition of facial cues that are overall critical to our behaviors. In this survey, we briefly review the current knowledge on the neurobiological substrate of facial recognition and discuss how the lack of salient stimuli might impact the ability to retain and consolidate learning and memory phenomena underlying face recognition. Such an ""abnormal"" visual experience raises the intriguing possibility of a ""reset"" mechanism, a renewed ability of adult brain to undergo synaptic plasticity adaptations.","Ferrari, Chiara; Vecchi, Tomaso; Sciamanna, Giuseppe; Blandini, Fabio; Pisani, Antonio; Natoli, Silvia",Neurobiol Dis,,211

We then subjected this data to the Johansen co-integration test and the fully modified least-squares (FMOLS) method. The results indicated that there was co-integration between the VIX and the COVID-19 pandemic and that there was co-integration between the VIX index and major indexes, except for the CAC 40 and MIB.

Experts have speculated the mental, economic, behavioral, and psychosocial problems linked to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a rise in suicide behavior. However, a quantitative synthesis is needed to reach an overall conclusion regarding the pandemic-suicide link. In the most comprehensive test of the COVID-19-suicidality link to date, we meta-analyzed data from 308,596 participants across 54 studies. Our results suggested increased event rates for suicide ideation (10.81%), suicide attempts (4.68%), and self-harm (9.63%) during the COVID-19 pandemic when considered against event rates from pre-pandemic studies. Moderation analysis indicated younger people, women, and individuals from democratic countries are most susceptible to suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers and helping professionals are advised that suicide behaviors are alarmingly common during the COVID-19 pandemic and vary based upon age, gender, and geopolitics. Strong protections from governments (e.g., implementing best practices in suicide prevention) are urgently needed to reduce suicide behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dubé, Justin P; Smith, Martin M; Sherry, Simon B; Hewitt, Paul L; Stewart, Sherry H",Psychiatry Res,,211
235824,Debate: Gold standard or go for gold? The pros and cons of waiting for gold standard evidence of effectiveness for adolescent depression and self-harm interventions versus acting with the precautionary principle in current political times,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of vaccines and established treatments, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are fundamental tools to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. NPIs require public interest in order to be successful. In the United States, there is a lack of published research on the factors that influenced public interest in COVID-19. Using Google Trends, we examined the US level of public interest in COVID-19 and how it correlated to testing and other countries. OBJECTIVE: To determine how public interest in COVID-19 in the US changed over time and the key factors driving this change, such as testing. US COVID-19 public interest was compared to countries that have been more successful in their containment and mitigation strategies. METHODS: In this retrospective study, Google Trends was used to analyze the volume of internet searches within the US relating to COVID-19, focusing on dates between December 31, 2019 to March 24, 2020. Volume of internet searches related to COVID-19 was compared to other countries. RESULTS: Within the US throughout January and February 2020, there was limited search interest in COVID-19. Interest declined for the first 21 days of February. A similar decline was seen in geographical regions that were later found to be experiencing undetected community transmission in February. Between March 9 and March 12, there was a rapid rise in search interest. This rise in search interest was positively correlated with the rise of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 (6.3, 95% CI -2.9 to 9.7; P <.001). Within the US, it took 52 days for search interest to rise substantially from first positive case; in countries with more successful outbreak control it took less than 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: Containment and mitigation strategies require public interest in order for them to be successful. The initial US level of COVID-19 public interest was limited, and even fell during a time when containment and mitigation strategies were being put in place. A lack of US public interest in COVID-19 existed when containment and mitigation policies were in place. Based on our analysis, it is clear policy makers need to develop novel methods of communicating COVID-19 public health initiatives.","Husain, Iltifat; Briggs, Blake; Lefebvre, Cedric; Cline, David M; Stopyra, Jason P; O039,; Brien, Mary Claire; Vaithi, Ramupriya; Gilmore, Scott; Countryman, Chase",,,211

ObjectivesTo describe the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating early pandemic among samples with S gene dropout and characterize a novel mutation in receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike protein. Study designAdults and children older than 2 months with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled from May to October 2020 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. All participants performed RT-PCR assays for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, samples with S gene dropout and Ct < 30 (cycle threshold) were submitted to whole genome sequencing (WGS), and homology modeling and physicochemical properties analysis were performed. Results484/1,557 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The S gene dropout was detected in 7.4% (36/484) as early as May, and a peak was observed in early August. WGS was performed in 8 samples. The B.1.1.28, B.1.91 and B.1.1.33 lineages were circulating in early pandemic.

239556,Fear of COVID-19 Scale for Hospital Staff in Regional Hospitals in Mexico: a Brief Report,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has generated anxiety and mental health issues in the common population. In general, anxiety and poor health are higher in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) than parents of children without ASD. However, the symptoms of anxiety, depression and poor mental health are likely to be more escalated in parents of children with ASD during COVID-19, possibly due to the emergency measures involving suspension of essential services, closure of schools, work-from-home policy and lack of professional support, etc. AIM: This empirical research aimed to explore the attitude, anxiety and perceived mental health care of parents of children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A total of 211 participants, including mothers and fathers of children with ASD from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, participated in this online study. Along with demographic details, data on attitude, anxiety, mental health status and perceived mental health care were obtained using both self-reported questionnaire and reference standard questionnaire. The collected data were analysed using t-test, Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis. The responses to open-ended questions were also collected and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS: The study revealed that attitudes towards taking care of children with ASD were affected by parents' age and child's age, and mothers were more affected. Further, the anxiety of parents during COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the COVID-19 situation. It was found that parents' mental status during COVID-19 mediated the interaction between anxiety and perceived mental health care. Finally, the open-ended questions indicated that parents sought support from teachers, family members and therapists to deal with children with ASD during the pandemic outbreak. In the context of perceived mental health care, besides psychological and financial support, other measures like training sessions, online classes, etc., were recommended. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study insisted on the importance of support from government and local health authorities to introduce interventions for parents and children with ASD to improve the overall mental health.","Althiabi, Youssef",Res Dev Disabil,,211
239557,Fear of COVID-19 Scale for Hospital Staff in Regional Hospitals in Mexico: a Brief Report,2020,"Increasing evidence suggests that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also invade the central nervous system (CNS). However, findings available on its neurological manifestations and their pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been systematically addressed. A literature search on neurological complications reported in patients with COVID-19 until June 2020 produced a total of 23 studies. Overall, these papers report that patients may exhibit a wide range of neurological manifestations, including encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures, cerebrovascular events, acute polyneuropathy, headache, hypogeusia, and hyposmia, as well as some non-specific symptoms. Whether these features can be an indirect and unspecific consequence of the pulmonary disease or a generalized inflammatory state on the CNS remains to be determined; also, they may rather reflect direct SARS-CoV-2-related neuronal damage. Hematogenous versus transsynaptic propagation, the role of the angiotensin II converting enzyme receptor-2, the spread across the blood-brain barrier, the impact of the hyperimmune response (the so-called ""cytokine storm""), and the possibility of virus persistence within some CNS resident cells are still debated. The different levels and severity of neurotropism and neurovirulence in patients with COVID-19 might be explained by a combination of viral and host factors and by their interaction.","Pennisi, Manuela; Lanza, Giuseppe; Falzone, Luca; Fisicaro, Francesco; Ferri, Raffaele; Bella, Rita",,,211

AIMS: The present study collected data on SARS-COV-2 positive family members (FM) of health care workers (HW) using serological rapid IgM/IgG tests (SRT), compared to positive HWs on SRT and serological quantitative IgG tests (SQT). METHODS: The study was conducted from May 2 to 31, 2020. Thirty-eight HWs were tested by both SRT and SQT; 81 FMs were screened using SRT. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to summarize the data. RESULTS: Of the 38 HWs, two (5,3%) showed an IgG line on SRT, confirmed by SQT. Thirty-two HWs decided on self-isolation from the family during the SARS-COV-2 spread. Out of 81 FMs, 26 (32,1%) were found IgG positive on SRT. Eleven (42%) of them had symptoms typical for COVID-19, during the study period. In two families, the HWs were the only negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: The general population's exposure to COVID-19 is less controlled than that of HWs. HWs experienced a lower infection rate than their families and did not represent a main transmission risk for relatives.","Lorenzo, Dioscoridi; Carrisi, Chiara",Int J Infect Dis,,211

Little is known about the prevalence of self-reported halitosis in adolescents in Nigeria and the extent to which self-reported halitosis impairs their oral health related quality of life. Objectives: To determine the prevalence and impact of self-reported halitosis on the oral health related quality of life of adolescent students in a suburban community in Nigeria. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study. Pre-tested self-administered pro-forma was used to obtain the adolescents' demographic data and their self-perception of halitosis. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) was used to assess the adolescents' OHRQoL. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the median OHIP-14 scores between adolescents who reported halitosis and those who did not. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Health Research and Ethics Committee of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Results: A total of 361 adolescents aged 10 - 19 years (mean age 14.1 ± 1.79 years) took part in the study. Of these, 32.7% (n=118) had self-reported halitosis. The median OHIP-14 score among adolescents with self-reported halitosis was 3 (0-9) while those who did not report halitosis had a median OHIP-14 score of 0 (0 - 5). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Self-reported halitosis significantly impaired the oral health related quality of life of the adolescents.","Alade, Omolola; Ajoloko, Ebenezer; Dedeke, Aderonke; Uti, Omolara; Sofola, Oyinkansola",Afr Health Sci,,211

Novel techniques that objectively confirm diagnoses are needed. This study details the development and validation of a melanoma prediction model from spatially resolved multivariate protein expression profiles generated by Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS). METHODS: Three board-certified dermatopathologists blindly evaluated 333 samples. Samples with triply concordant diagnoses were included in this study, divided into a training set (n = 241) and a test set (n = 92). Both the training and test sets included various representative subclasses of unambiguous nevi and melanomas. A prediction model was developed from the training set using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classification model. RESULTS: We validated the prediction model on the independent test set of 92 specimens (75 classified correctly, two misclassified, and 15 indeterminate). IMS detects melanoma with a sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 96.4% when evaluating each unique spot. IMS predicts melanoma at the sample level with a sensitivity of 97.3% and a specificity of 97.5%. Indeterminate results were excluded from sensitivity and specificity calculations. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that IMS-based proteomics results are highly concordant to diagnostic results obtained by careful histopathologic evaluation from a panel of expert dermatopathologists.

Economies and worldwide societies expect huge damages comparable to that caused by war. To the effects of this crisis on employment and wages must be added those produced in the workplace, with a foreseeable increase in job strain, not only as of the result of the health security reasons in the workplace but also to the effects on work-life balance, training and promotion possibilities, etc. This research analyses the impact of the economic situation on health, the influence of health on labour strain and on job quality. Using OECD data and a structural equation model, we have investigated the relationship between economy, health, quality of the job, work-life balance and well-being. The importance of security and safeness in the workplace is one of the items for evaluating job strain, particularly when they become even more crucial in pandemic times. This issue implicates not only the real risk of individual and social health but also a stressful situation for workers. The main contribution of our paper relies on establishing and prove causal relations among social and economic variables related to health, well-being and job quality, including safeness at the workplace. Considering that this relationship will probably become reinforced after a pandemic, like COVID-19, the actual relevance of the analysed topic and the achieved results becomes crucial.

The thematic analysis highlighted challenges specific to participants' sport (e.g., budgetary constraints, decentralized experiences, athletes with various impairments), personal life (e.g., moving cities to access coaching, postponing vocational/educational developments, isolation from social circles), and associated uncertainties (e.g., COVID-19, qualifications, accreditations). Participants managed these challenges by utilizing strategies to 'anticipate and prepare' (e.g., detailed planning, effective communication, contingency plans) and 'manage expectations' (e.g., understanding specific roles and boundaries, focusing on the process [i.e., effort over results]). Trust and communication between athletes and coaches was key in coaches' better understanding of how athletes' impairments interact with their training and competition environments and tailor support to each athlete's unique needs. Last, participants reflected on the 'pressure' of the Games due to their performance having an impact on their career trajectory 'post-Tokyo' with some athletes contemplating retirement and others realizing the consequences of their performance on sport-related vocation and sponsorship. Coaches also accepted the success of their programs and job security will depend on outcomes at the Games. The findings from this study shed light on factors to consider to reduce challenges for teams preparing for major competitions but also highlight key practical implications to support athletes and coaches leading up, during, and post-major Games.","Dehghansai, N; Pinder, R A; Baker, J; Renshaw, I",PLoS One,,211

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has caused major public health crises. There have been more than 4,400,000 reported cases of COVID-2019 and more than 300,000 reported deaths to date (16/05/2020). SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have attracted widespread global attention due to their high infectivity and pathogenicity. To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective against these viral infectious diseases. Vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent viral infections. Therefore, the development of effective vaccines against highly pathogenic coronaviruses is essential. In this review, we will briefly describe coronavirus vaccine design targets, summarize recent advances in the development of coronavirus vaccines, and highlight current adjuvants for improving the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines.","He, Chunting; Qin, Ming; Sun, Xun",Acta Pharm.

269782,First paediatric COVID-19 associated death in Italy,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, may need intensive care unit (ICU) admission in up to 12% of all positive cases for massive interstitial pneumonia, with possible long-term endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy. The most common airway-related complications of such ICU maneuvers are laryngotracheal granulomas, webs, stenosis, malacia and, less commonly, tracheal necrosis with tracheo-esophageal or tracheo-arterial fistulae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper gathers the opinions of experts of the Laryngotracheal Stenosis Committee of the European Laryngological Society, with the aim of alerting the medical community about the possible rise in number of COVID-19-related laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS), and the aspiration of paving the way to a more rationale concentration of these cases within referral specialist airway centers. RESULTS: A range of prevention strategies, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic approaches are reported and framed within the COVID-19 pandemic context. CONCLUSIONS: One of the most important roles of otolaryngologists when encountering airway-related signs and symptoms in patients with previous ICU hospitalization for COVID-19 is to maintain a high level of suspicion for LTS development, and share it with colleagues and other health care professionals. Such a condition requires specific expertise and should be comprehensively managed in tertiary referral centers.","Piazza, Cesare; Filauro, Marta; Dikkers, Frederik G; Nouraei, S A Reza; Sandu, Kishore; Sittel, Christian; Amin, Milan R; Campos, Guillermo; Eckel, Hans E; Peretti, Giorgio",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,211
269991,Casual Sex among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) during the Period of Sheltering in Place to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19,2021,"Coronaviridae is a peculiar viral family, with a very large RNA genome and characteristic appearance, endowed with remarkable tendency to transfer from animals to humans. Since the beginning of the 21st century, three highly transmissible and pathogenic coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused deadly pneumonia, inflicting severe outbreaks and causing human health emergencies of inconceivable magnitude. Indeed, in the past two decades, two human coronaviruses emerged causing serious respiratory illness: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing more than 10,000 cumulative cases, with mortality rates of 10 % for SARS-CoV-1 and 34.4 % for MERS-CoV. More recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in China and has been identified as the etiological agent of the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. It has rapidly spread throughout the world, causing nearly 22 million cases and â¼ 770,000 deaths worldwide, with an estimated mortality rate of â¼3.6 %, hence posing serious challenges for adequate and effective prevention and treatment. Currently, with the exception of the nucleotide analogue prodrug remdesivir, and despite several efforts, there is no known specific, proven, pharmacological treatment capable of efficiently and rapidly inducing viral containment and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as no broad-spectrum drug for other human pathogenic coronaviruses. Another confounding factor is the paucity of molecular information regarding the tendency of coronaviruses to acquire drug resistance, a gap that should be filled in order to optimize the efficacy of antiviral drugs. In this light, the present review provides a systematic update on the current knowledge of the marked global efforts towards the development of antiviral strategies aimed at coping with the infection sustained by SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic coronaviruses, displaying drug resistance profiles. The attention has been focused on antiviral drugs mainly targeting viral protease, RNA polymerase and spike glycoprotein, that have been tested in vitro and/or in clinical trials as well as on promising compounds proven to be active against coronaviruses by an in silico drug repurposing approach. In this respect, novel insights on compounds, identified by structure-based virtual screening on the DrugBank database endowed by multi-targeting profile, are also reported. We specifically identified 14 promising compounds characterized by a good in silico binding affinity towards, at least, two of the four studied targets (viral and host proteins). Among which, ceftolozane and NADH showed the best multi-targeting profile, thus potentially reducing the emergence of resistant virus strains. We also focused on potentially novel pharmacological targets for the development of compounds with anti-pan coronavirus activity. Through the analysis of a large set of viral genomic sequences, the current review provides a comprehensive and specific map of conserved regions across human coronavirus proteins which are essential for virus replication and thus with no or very limited tendency to mutate. Hence, these represent key druggable targets for novel compounds against this virus family. In this respect, the identification of highly effective and innovative pharmacological strategies is of paramount importance for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the current pandemic but potentially also for future and unavoidable outbreaks of human pathogenic coronaviruses.","Artese, Anna; Svicher, Valentina; Costa, Giosuè; Salpini, Romina; Di Maio, Velia Chiara; Alkhatib, Mohammad; Ambrosio, Francesca Alessandra; Santoro, Maria Mercedes; Assaraf, Yehuda G; Alcaro, Stefano; Ceccherini-Silberstein, Francesca",Drug Resist Updat,,211

270468,"Joint MH, COVID-19 campaign offers critical resources",2021,"Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are now being widely used for classifying and detecting pulmonary abnormalities in chest radiographs. Two complementary generalization properties of CNNs, translation invariance and equivariance, are particularly useful in detecting manifested abnormalities associated with pulmonary disease, regardless of their spatial locations within the image. However, these properties also come with the loss of exact spatial information and global relative positions of abnormalities detected in local regions. Global relative positions of such abnormalities may help distinguish similar conditions, such as COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. In such instances, a global attention mechanism is needed, which CNNs do not support in their traditional architectures that aim for generalization afforded by translation invariance and equivariance. Vision Transformers provide a global attention mechanism, but lack translation invariance and equivariance, requiring significantly more training data samples to match generalization of CNNs. To address the loss of spatial information and global relations between features, while preserving the inductive biases of CNNs, we present a novel technique that serves as an auxiliary attention mechanism to existing CNN architectures, in order to extract global correlations between salient features.","Verenich, Edward; Martin, Tobias; Velasquez, Alvaro; Khan, Nazar; Hussain, Faraz",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00573v1.pdf,211

272571,Addressing Justified Vaccine Hesitancy in the Black Community,2021,"To obtain consistent chromatographic behavior, it is important to develop resin packing methods in accordance with the characteristics of each resin. Resins, particularly those with a significant level of compressibility, require proper knowledge of the packing methodology to ensure scalable performance. The study demonstrates the applicability of pressure-flow modeling based on the Blake-Kozeny equation for cellulose based resins, using the MEP HyperCel (Pall) resin as a case study. This approach enabled the understanding of the appropriate bed compressibility and the determination of the minimum column diameter that can predict bed integrity during commercial manufacturing scale operation. Studies suggested that scale-dependent wall effects become negligible for column diameters exceeding 20 cm. Pressure-flow modeling produced a minimum compression recommendation of 0.206 for the MEP HyperCel resin. Columns with diameters up to 80 cm packed with this bed compression yielded incompressible beds with pressure-flow curves consistent with model predictions. Model parameter (particle diameter, viscosity, porosity) values were then varied to demonstrate how changing operating conditions influence model predictions. This analysis supported the successful troubleshooting of unexpected high pressures at the commercial manufacturing scale using MEP HyperCel resin, further supporting the applicability of this approach.","Prentice, Jessica; Evans, Steven T; Robbins, David; Ferreira, Gisela",J Chromatogr A,,211

Novel technologies represent promising tools for their management, the use of which has been greatly encouraged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study is to compare a web-based nutritional intervention versus a traditional one, before and during the Italian 'lockdown' period due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in overweight and obese subjects affected by T2D or impaired glucose regulation (IGR). METHODS: For the study, 36 subjects were randomly allocated into two arms: a traditional arm, providing face-to-face individual and group-based intervention; and a web arm, deploying the in-presence traditional approach with intervention provided through web technologies. The outcomes were the data resulting from the comparison between the subjects' anthropometric and clinical parameters as well as PREDIMED scores at baseline with those at 3 months (T3), 6 months (T6) and at lockdown. RESULTS: In the web arm we detected a progressive reduction in weight and body mass index (BMI) from baseline to T6 and a minimal increase of both parameters during the lockdown. Improvement of these parameters compared with baseline was observed in controls during the lockdown. The PREDIMED score improved at T6 compared with baseline in both arms. Significant variations were observed considering weight (p < 0.001), BMI (p = 0.001) and PREDIMED scores (p = 0.023) over time.

OBJECTIVES: to evaluate whether the psychological state and behaviours of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and their caregivers were different from the non-MS population or not during the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 115 MS patients, 33 MS caregivers and 129 healthy controls. Depression anxiety stress score-21 (DASS-21) was used for evaluation of their psychological state. RESULTS: MS patients had significantly higher DASS-21 scores (51.48±29.62) than their caregivers (29.79±27.19) and non-MS population (32.91±23.39) (p = 0.005). Younger patients (r=-0.252, p<0.0001), those with high EDSS scores (r = 0.023, p = 0.013) and those who believed that MS patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection (p = 0.009) had the highest anxiety scores.

This article tracks the development of TraceTogether and engages in critical debates that have ensued around the use of the app, namely around the twin implications of privacy protection and the conduct of surveillance in a panoptic and auto-regulatory society that privileges socio-political discipline and control. With health crises and pandemics becoming more commonplace, more people around the world are being persuaded to wear some loss of privacy to trust ‘smart’ technologies to aid us in fighting enemies that are deadly and invisible. Singapore could already be offering a glimpse of how this can be done now, and in the future.","Lee, Terence; Lee, Howard",Media Int. Aust.,,211

METHODS: The H/R injury involved hypoxia for 3 h and then reperfusion for 2 h. Cardiomyocytes recruited from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were randomly divided into control, H/R, H/R+compound C (C.C), H/R+PQS, and H/R+C. C+PQS groups. BrdU assay, lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and early apoptosis rate were evaluated to assess cell damages. Contents of high energy phosphate compounds were conducted to detect the energy production. Protein expression levels of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase a (AMPK&#945;), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), phosphate fructose kinase 2 (PFK2), fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation 36 (FAT/CD36), and acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) in the regulatory pathways were measured by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining of GLUT4 and FAT/CD36 was used to observe the mobilization of metabolic transporters. RESULTS: PQS (50 mg/L) pretreatment significantly alleviated H/R-induced inhibition of NRVMs viability, up-regulation of LDH leakage, acceleration of early apoptosis, and reduction of energy production (P<0.05). Compared with the H/R group, up-regulated expression of AMPK&#945;, GLUT4, PFK2, FAT/CD36 and ACC2 were observed, and more GLUT4 and FAT/CD36 expressions were detected on the membrane in the H/R+PQS group (P<0.05). These effects of PQS on H/R-induced NRVMs were eliminated in the H/R+C.C+PQS group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: PQS has prominent advantages in protecting NRVMs from H/R-induced cell damages and energy metabolic disorders, by activation of AMPK&#945;-mediated GLUT4-PFK2 and FAT/CD36-ACC2 pathways.","Yu, Yong-Hui; Zhang, Pei; Wang, Cheng-Long; Liu, Jian-Gang; Li, Peng; Zhang, Da-Wu",Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,,211

284044,"Mental Health, Risk Factors, and Social Media Use During the COVID-19 Epidemic and Cordon Sanitaire Among the Community and Health Professionals in Wuhan, China: Cross-Sectional Survey",2020,"BACKGROUND: It is nearly impossible to overestimate the burden of chronic pain, which is associated with enormous personal and socioeconomic costs. Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in the world, is associated with multiple psychiatric comorbidities, and has been causally linked to the opioid crisis. Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous organizations. The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, creating a dilemma for physicians charged with the responsibility to limit spread of the contagion and to treat the patients they are entrusted to care for. METHODS: To address these issues, an expert panel was convened that included pain management experts from the military, Veterans Health Administration, and academia. Endorsement from stakeholder societies was sought upon completion of the document within a one-week period. RESULTS: In these guidelines, we provide a framework for pain practitioners and institutions to balance the often-conflicting goals of risk mitigation for health care providers, risk mitigation for patients, conservation of resources, and access to pain management services. Specific issues discussed include general and intervention-specific risk mitigation, patient flow issues and staffing plans, telemedicine options, triaging recommendations, strategies to reduce psychological sequelae in health care providers, and resource utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 public health crisis has strained health care systems, creating a conundrum for patients, pain medicine practitioners, hospital leaders, and regulatory officials. Although this document provides a framework for pain management services, systems-wide and individual decisions must take into account clinical considerations, regional health conditions, government and hospital directives, resource availability, and the welfare of health care providers.","Cohen, Steven P; Baber, Zafeer B; Buvanendran, Asokumar; McLean, Brian C; Chen, Yian; Hooten, W Michael; Laker, Scott R; Wasan, Ajay D; Kennedy, David J; Sandbrink, Friedhelm; King, Scott A; Fowler, Ian M; Stojanovic, Milan P; Hayek, Salim M; Phillips, Christopher R",Pain Med,,211

METHOD: Ecological study that used epidemiological, demographic, environmental and variables on the structure of health services as explanatory variables. The analysis period was from March 15th (the start of the alarm state) until April 22nd, 2020. Incidence and mortality rates were the main response variables. The magnitude of the associations has been estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality rates at the time of decree of alarm status are associated with current incidence, mortality and hospital demand rates. Higher mean temperatures are significantly associated with a lower current incidence of COVID-19 in the autonomous communities. Likewise, a higher proportion of older people in nursing homes is significantly associated with a higher current mortality in the autonomous communities. CONCLUSION: It is possible to predict the evolution of the epidemic through the analysis of incidence and mortality. Lower temperatures and the proportion of older people in residences are factors associated with a worse prognosis. These parameters must be considered in decisions about the timing and intensity of the implementation of containment measures. In this sense, strengthening epidemiological surveillance is essential to improve predictions.","Medeiros Figueiredo, Alexandre; Daponte-Codina, Antonio; Moreira Marculino Figueiredo, Daniela Cristina; Toledo Vianna, Rodrigo Pinheiro; Costa de Lima, Kenio; Gil-García, Eugenia","Gac. sanit.

290271,Comprehensive Medication Review Completion in Medically Underserved Areas and Populations,2021,"The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a worldwide threat to human life since its invasion into the daily lives of the public in the first several months of 2020. Predicting the size of confirmed cases is important for countries and communities to make proper prevention and control policies so as to effectively curb the spread of COVID-19. Different from the 2003 SARS epidemic and the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, COVID-19 has unique epidemiological characteristics in its infectious and recovered compartments. This drives us to formulate a new infectious dynamic model for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic within the human mobility network, named the SaucIR-model in the sense that the new compartmental model extends the benchmark SIR model by dividing the flow of people in the infected state into asymptomatic, pathologically infected but unconfirmed, and confirmed. Furthermore, we employ dynamic modeling of population flow in the model in order that spatial effects can be incorporated effectively. We forecast the spread of accumulated confirmed cases in some provinces of mainland China and other countries that experienced severe infection during the time period from late February to early May 2020. The novelty of incorporating the geographic spread of the pandemic leads to a surprisingly good agreement with published confirmed case reports. The numerical analysis validates the high degree of predictability of our proposed SaucIR model compared to existing resemblance. The proposed forecasting SaucIR model is implemented in Python. A web-based application is also developed by Dash (under construction).","Wang, Xinyu; Yang, Lu; Zhang, Hong; Yang, Zhouwang; Liu, Catherine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00397v1.pdf,211

This paper presents initial intensive-care unit (ICU) experiences with COVID-19 patients at Roskilde Hospital, which was the primary recipient of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care in the Zealand Region, Denmark. METHODS: An evaluation was conducted of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure from 11 March 2020 to 01 April 2020. The number of ICU beds was increased from eight to 22 beds during this period. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (four women) were evaluated. The median age was 69.5 years (range: 56-84 years). All the patients were admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and all needed mechanical ventilation by orotracheal intubation. By 16 April, six patients were still admitted to the ICU, four patients had been discharged from the ICU and seven had died. At present, the average length of ICU stay is 14 ± 9 days (mean ± standard deviation). One patient has remained on ventilatory support for 31 days. The evaluation revealed four key themes.

297514,Disruption to homeostasis,2020,"The ability of influenza A virus to evolve, coupled with increasing antimicrobial resistance, could trigger an influenza pandemic with great morbidity and mortality. Much of the 1918 influenza pandemic mortality was likely due to bacterial coinfection, including Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. S. aureus resists many antibiotics. The lack of new antibiotics suggests alternative antimicrobials, such as bacteriophages, are needed. Potential delivery routes for bacteriophage therapy (BT) include inhalation and intravenous injection. BT has recently been used successfully in compassionate access pulmonary infection cases. Phage lysins, enzymes that hydrolyze bacterial cell walls and which are bactericidal, are efficacious in animal pneumonia models. Clinical trials will be needed to determine whether BT can ameliorate disease in influenza and S. aureus coinfection.","Speck, Peter G; Warner, Morgyn S; Bihari, Shailesh; Bersten, Andrew D; Mitchell, James G; Tucci, Joseph; Gordon, David L",Future Microbiol,,211

METHODS: A questionnaire (n = 19 questions) was sent to all members of the Italian Society of Radiology two months after the first Italian national lockdown was lifted. RESULTS: A total of 327 Italian radiologists took part in the survey (mean age: 49 ± 12 years). After national lockdown, the working-flow came back to normal in the vast majority of cases (285/327, 87.2%). Participants reported that a total of 462 radiological trials were recruiting patients at their institutions prior to COVID-19 outbreak, of which 332 (71.9%) were stopped during the emergency. On the other hand, 252 radiological trials have been started during the pandemic, of which 156 were non-COVID-19 trials (61.9%) and 96 were focused on COVID-19 patients (38.2%). The majority of radiologists surveyed (61.5%) do not conduct research. Of the radiologists who carried on research activities, participants reported a significant increase of the number of hours per week spent for research purposes during national lockdown (mean 4.5 ± 8.9 h during lockdown vs. 3.3 ± 6.8 h before lockdown; p = .046), followed by a significant drop after the lockdown was lifted (3.2 ± 6.5 h per week, p = .035). During national lockdown, 15.6% of participants started new review articles and completed old papers, 14.1% completed old works, and 8.9% started new review articles. Ninety-six surveyed radiologists (29.3%) declared to have submitted at least one article during COVID-19 emergency. CONCLUSION: This study shows the need to support radiology research in challenging scenarios like COVID-19 emergency.","Tagliafico, Alberto Stefano; Albano, Domenico; Torri, Lorenzo; Messina, Carmelo; Gitto, Salvatore; Bruno, Federico; Barile, Antonio; Giovagnoni, Andrea; Miele, Vittorio; Grassi, Roberto; Sconfienza, Luca Maria",Clin Imaging,,211

312280,A Novel Method of Assessing Clinical Preparedness for COVID-19 and Other Disasters,2020,"In my 2019 publication, Constructing Crisis: Leaders, Crisis, and Claims of Urgency, I argued that “crisis” is a label, a claim of urgency employed, typically by leaders, to characterize a set of contingencies that are, together, taken to pose a serious and immediate threat. I then proposed a typology for sorting through any such claim in order to reach a judgment concerning the legitimacy of the claim. Classification systems such as typologies are foundational to knowledge creation in that they enable pattern recognition. How we classify phenomenon has a real impact on how we consider and behave in response to that phenomenon. In the context of a global pandemic, the importance of critical judgment is especially salient. Labeling the global pandemic as a crisis may be non-controversial (to most). But there are enumerable claims being made under the general rubric of that pandemic that are not nearly so widely and easily accepted. Furthermore, claims of urgency will continue long after this particular contingency passes. It is never advisable to relax a critical perspective, especially when assertions of power and interests are involved and the stakes are so high.","Spector, Bert",Leadership,,211

METHODS: Patients with and without COVID-19 were included from 4 Hong Kong hospitals. The database was randomly split into 2:1: for model development database (n = 895) and validation database (n = 435). Multivariable logistic regression was utilised for model creation and validated with the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and calibration plot. Nomograms and probabilities set at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 were calculated to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: A total of 1330 patients (mean age 58.2 ± 24.5 years; 50.7% males; 296 COVID-19 positive) were recruited. The first prediction model developed had age, total white blood cell count, chest x-ray appearances and contact history as significant predictors (AUC = 0.911 [CI = 0.880-0.941]). The second model developed has the same variables except contact history (AUC = 0.880 [CI = 0.844-0.916]). Both were externally validated on the H-L test (p = 0.781 and 0.155, respectively) and calibration plot. Models were converted to nomograms. Lower probabilities give higher sensitivity and NPV; higher probabilities give higher specificity and PPV. CONCLUSION: Two simple-to-use validated nomograms were developed with excellent AUCs based on readily available parameters and can be considered for clinical utilisation.","Ng, Ming-Yen; Wan, Eric Yuk Fai; Wong, Ho Yuen Frank; Leung, Siu Ting; Lee, Jonan Chun Yin; Chin, Thomas Wing-Yan; Lo, Christine Shing Yen; Lui, Macy Mei-Sze; Chan, Edward Hung Tat; Fong, Ambrose Ho-Tung; Fung, Sau Yung; Ching, On Hang; Chiu, Keith Wan-Hang; Chung, Tom Wai Hin; Vardhanbhuti, Varut; Lam, Hiu Yin Sonia; To, Kelvin Kai Wang; Chiu, Jeffrey Long Fung; Lam, Tina Poy Wing; Khong, Pek Lan; Liu, Raymond Wai To; Chan, Johnny Wai Man; Wu, Alan Ka Lun; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai; Lau, Chak Sing; Kuo, Michael D; Ip, Mary Sau-Man",Int J Infect Dis,,211
316012,Challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic for perinatal mental health care: a mixed-methods study of mental health care staff,2021,"AimsFrom the outset of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the lockdown that subsequently ensued, a challenge was posed to reshape previously face-to-face meetings in all walks of life. One area that rose to this, with quick introduction of online sessions, was the Balint Group. We aimed to take a snapshot of the effect virtual Balint sessions have had and analyse the themes that members of virtual Balint groups have been identifying about their online group experience at this particularly challenging time for healthcare workers. We hope this will inform both leaders and participants of future online groups of the benefits and pitfalls found by these members reflecting on their first experiences of virtual Balint.MethodSeven members of virtual Balint groups across the UK were randomly selected for interview from a pool of volunteers facilitated by the UK Balint Society after the first 6 months of their first virtual Balint experience. Interviews were conducted by two academic foundation doctors who were not members of the Balint groups. Qualitative thematic analysis was then conducted on these interview transcripts. Going forward, as Balint groups continue online, the researchers plan to interview further group members and leaders to look for change and development in the primary themes identified.ResultKey positive themes identified when discussing virtual Balint were ease of access, increased anonymity, attention to facial expressions and interaction with participants from different parts of the country. The most common drawback themes were a lack of socialising and different group dynamic as well as the expected technical and environmental challenges. Interestingly all participants reported that ‘silence’ and ‘sitting/stepping back’ were still used in their online sessions. Core theme analysis indicates the virtual Balint descriptions draw out sentiments of safe, open and structured sessions. In these early sessions a frequent theme was the increased role of the leader.ConclusionAll participants interviewed so far have felt their online experiences have had many positive aspects. They highlight areas they feel virtual Balint could develop to better replicate the original sessions. The fact some interviewees would prefer to maintain online Balint groups even when ‘in person’ options resume makes it likely this will not be a transient rise in virtual Balint and that the style may be here to stay. Based on this, the role for feedback and constant evaluation and improvement will be central to virtual Balint evolution.","Handa, Nikhita Garbutt Romy Chudley Sylvia",BJPsych Open,,211
316013,Challenges and opportunities of the COVID-19 pandemic for perinatal mental health care: a mixed-methods study of mental health care staff,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the medical workforce. This has put them at increased risk of burnout at a time when levels are already worryingly high in the profession, with recent studies consistently showing that around half of doctors meet the validated criteria for burnout. OBJECTIVES: To understand the wider factors influencing and impacting upon hospital doctors' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in England. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey and mixed quantitative-qualitative analysis. SETTING: Acute National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust in England. PARTICIPANTS: An online survey was circulated in early June 2020 to all 449 doctors employed by the Trust. 242 doctors completed the survey (54% response rate). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Questions assessed occupational details, self-reported changes in physical and mental health, satisfaction with working hours and patterns, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), medication and facilities, communication and sought to identify areas seen as having a significant effect on doctors' well-being. RESULTS: 96% of respondents requiring PPE were able to access it. Nearly half of the respondents felt that their mental health had deteriorated since the start of the pandemic. Over a third stated that their physical health had also declined. Issues identified as having a negative impact on doctors included increased workload, redeployment, loss of autonomy, personal issues affecting family members, anxiety around recovery plans, inadequate access to changing and storage facilities and to rest areas that allow for social distancing. Doctors appreciated access to 'calm rooms' that were made available for staff, access to clinical psychology support, free drinks and free car parking on site. CONCLUSION: The emerging themes are suggestive of increased burnout risk among doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic and encompass factors well beyond shortage of PPE. Small organisational initiatives and the implementation of changes suggested by survey respondents can have a positive impact on doctors' well-being.","Cubitt, Lyndsey Jayne; Im, Yu Ri; Scott, Ciaran James; Jeynes, Louise Claire; Molyneux, Paul David",BMJ Open,,211
316168,Moving into 2021: Refocusing on the critical issues in child mental health,2021,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged social isolation as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic has been a source of considerable psychological distress for many people. This can manifest in many ways and if left undetected can impact negatively on general health. It is essential to understand the impact of these conditions on inflammatory arthritis (IA) patients, especially axial spondyloarthropathy (axSpA). AIM: To capture the level of psychological distress for patients with IA following prolonged social isolation. METHODS: A survey was sent out to patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IA. This captured changes in sleep, mood, disease activity, employment and general health since the beginning of the social isolation period. A PHQ-4 (Patient Health Questionnaire) was included to determine level of psychological distress. RESULTS: Females with IA reported significantly higher rates of decline in general health (40% vs 16%, p = 0.01), mood disturbance (43.4% vs 26%, p = 0.03) and increased disease activity (50% vs 16%, p = 0.01) compared to males. Evaluating the mean PHQ-4 scores, no significant difference was noted between genders (4.80 vs 3.44, p = 0.10). However, females demonstrated a non-significant trend toward increased rates of moderate to severe psychological distress (40% vs 30%, p = 0.13). Subanalysis of patients with axSpA found high rates of moderate to severe distress in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Females with IA reported significantly higher rates of decline in general health, mood disturbance and increased disease activity during the period of social isolation. This was reflected in a trend towards greater levels of psychological distress.","Maguire, Sinead; O039,; Shea, Finbar",Ir. j. med. sci,,211
316186,Psychometric Evaluation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale Among Chinese Population,2021,"Aggressive immune response, due to overexpressed proinflammatory molecules, has been characterized in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Some of those mediators have a dual and opposite role on immune systems at play behind differential disease severities. We investigated the expression of some cytokines and chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh. We diagnosed the patients by detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in nasal swab samples by the real-time RT-PCR method. Thirty adult patients were preselected based on their disease severities and grouped into mild, moderate, and severe cases. Nine healthy volunteers participated in this study as a control. Relative expression of nine cytokines/chemokine in total leukocytes was semi-quantified in SYBRgreen-based real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We performed statistical tests on transformed log data using SPSS 24.0. At the onset of symptoms (Day 1), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (p < 0.05) and interleukin (IL)-6 (p > 0.05) were upregulated in all COVID-19 groups, although the expression levels did not significantly correlate with disease severities. However, expressions of IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1&#945;, tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), and ACE2, on Day 14, were positively correlated with disease severities. Relative viral load at Day 1 showed no significant correlation with cytokine expression but had a significant positive correlation with RANTES and ACE2 expression on Day 14 (p < 0.05). Male patients had a higher level of IL-6 than female patients on Day 1 (p < 0.05). All COVID-19 patients showed upregulated cytokines and chemokines on Day 14 compared to Day 1 except TNF-&#945;. Female patients had a higher expression of ACE2 and IL-12 on Day 14. Upregulated cytokines/chemokines at the convalescent stage, especially IL-6, may help in targeting anticytokine therapy in post-COVID-19 patients' management.","Nigar, Shireen; Shah, Sm Tanjil; Setu, Md Ali Ahasan; Dip, Sourav Dutta; Ibnat, Habiba; Islam, M Touhidul; Akter, Selina; Jahid, Iqbal Kabir; Hossain, M Anwar",J. med. virol,,211
316643,The Influence of COVID-19 Information Sources on the Attitudes and Practices Toward COVID-19 Among the General Public of Saudi Arabia: Cross-sectional Online Survey Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat to human health. Internet hospitals have emerged as a critical technology to bring epidemic-related web-based services and medical support to the public. However, only a few very recent scientific literature reports have explored the effects of internet hospitals on psychological burden and disease knowledge in major public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the role of internet hospitals in relieving psychological burden and increasing disease knowledge during the early outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey was conducted from January 26 to February 1, 2020, during the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The platform used for the consultation was the WeChat public account of our hospital. To participate in the study, the patient was required to answer a list of questions to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 infection and confirm their willingness to participate voluntarily. Next, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire. After the internet consultation, the participant was directed to complete the self-report questionnaire again. The questionnaire included sections on general information, the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and the participant's worries, disease knowledge, and need for hospital treatment. RESULTS: The total number of internet consultations was 4120. The consultation topics mainly included respiratory symptoms such as cough, expectoration, and fever (2489/4120, 60.4%) and disease knowledge, anxiety, and fear (1023/4120, 24.8%). A total of 1530 people filled out the questionnaires before and after the internet consultation. Of these people, 1398/1530 (91.4%) experienced psychological stress before the internet consultation, which significantly decreased after consultation (260/1530, 17.0%) (&#967;21=1704.8, P<.001). There was no significant difference in the number of people who expressed concern about the COVID-19 pandemic before and after the internet consultation (&#967;21=0.7, P=.43). However, the degree of concern after the internet consultation was significantly alleviated (t2699=90.638, P<.001). The main worries before and after consultation were the dangers posed by the disease and the risk of infection of family members. The scores of the self-assessment risk after the internet consultation were significantly lower than those before consultation (t3058=95.694, P<.001). After the consultation, the participants' knowledge of the symptoms, transmission routes, and preventive measures of COVID-19 was significantly higher than before the consultation (t3058=-106.105, -80.456, and -152.605, respectively; all P<.001). The hospital treatment need score after the internet consultation decreased from 3.3 (SD 1.2) to 1.6 (SD 0.8), and the difference was statistically significant (t3058=45.765, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the early outbreak of COVID-19, internet hospitals could help relieve psychological burdens and increase disease awareness through timely and rapid spread of knowledge regarding COVID-19 prevention and control. Internet hospitals should be an important aspect of a new medical model in public health emergency systems.","Li, Lin; Liu, Gang; Xu, Weiguo; Zhang, Yun; He, Mei",J Med Internet Res,,211

This study aimed to compare anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown among adults from 11 countries and to examine their associations with country-level COVID-19 factors and personal COVID-19 exposure. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults (&#8805;18 years) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, North Macedonia, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Mental health (anxiety, depression, resilient coping, hope) and other study data were collected between June-August 2020. Of the 13,263 participants, 62.8% were female and 51.7% were 18-34 years old. Participants living in Brazil had the highest anxiety and depression symptoms while participants living in Singapore had the lowest. Greater personal COVID-19 exposure was associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms, but country-level COVID-19 factors were not. Higher levels of hope were associated with reduced anxiety and depression; higher levels of resilient coping were associated with reduced anxiety but not depression. Substantial variations exist in anxiety and depression symptoms across countries during the COVID-19 lockdown, with personal COVID-19 exposure being a significant risk factor. Strategies that mitigate COVID-19 exposure and enhance hope and resilience may reduce anxiety and depression during global emergencies.","Ding, Kele; Yang, Jingzhen; Chin, Ming-Kai; Sullivan, Lindsay; Demirhan, Giyasettin; Violant-Holz, Veronica; Uvinha, Ricardo R; Dai, Jianhui; Xu, Xia; Popeska, Biljana; Mladenova, Zornitza; Khan, Waheeda; Kuan, Garry; Balasekaran, Govindasamy; Smith, Gary A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,211
317359,Opportunities for international collaboration in COVID-19 mental health research,2020,"There is increasing evidence that patients with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) present with neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Anosmia, hypogeusia, headache, nausea and altered consciousness are commonly described, although there are emerging clinical reports of more serious and specific conditions such as acute cerebrovascular accident, encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Whether these presentations are directly due to viral invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) or caused by indirect mechanisms has yet to be established. Neuropathological examination of brain tissue at autopsy will be essential to establish the neuro-invasive potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus but, to date, there have been few detailed studies. The pathological changes in the brain probably represent a combination of direct cytopathic effects mediated by SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirect effects due to respiratory failure, injurious cytokine reaction, reduced immune response and cerebrovascular accidents induced by viral infection. Further large-scale molecular and cellular investigations are warranted to clarify the neuropathological correlates of the neurological and psychiatric features seen clinically in COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the current reports of neuropathological examination in COVID-19 patients, in addition to our own experience, and discuss their contribution to the understanding of CNS involvement in this disease.","Al-Sarraj, S; Troakes, C; Hanley, B; Osborn, M; Richardson, M P; Hotopf, M; Bullmore, E; Everall, I P",Neuropathol. appl. neurobiol,,211
318142,Changes in physical activity and rest-activity circadian rhythm among Hong Kong community aged population before and during COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: There is limited published data on antibiotic use in neonatal units in resource-poor settings. Objectives: This study sought to describe antibiotic prescribing practices in three neonatology units in Kigali, Rwanda. Methods: A multi-center, cross-sectional study conducted in two tertiary and one urban district hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. Participants were neonates admitted in neonatology who received a course of antibiotics during their admission. Data collected included risk factors for neonatal sepsis, clinical signs, symptoms, investigations for neonatal sepsis, antibiotics prescribed, and the number of deaths in the included cohort. Results: 126 neonates were enrolled with 42 from each site. Prematurity (38%) followed by membrane rupture more than 18 hours (25%) were the main risk factors for neonatal sepsis. Ampicillin and Gentamicin (85%) were the most commonly used first-line antibiotics for suspected neonatal sepsis. Most neonates (87%) did not receive a second-line antibiotic. Cefotaxime (11%), was the most commonly used second-line antibiotic. The median duration of antibiotic use was four days in all surviving neonates (m=113). In neonates with negative blood culture and normal C-reactive protein (CRP), the median duration of antibiotics was 3.5 days; and for neonates, with positive blood cultures, the median duration was 11 days. Thirteen infants died (10%) at all three sites, with no significant difference between the sites. Conclusion: The median antibiotic duration for neonates with normal lab results exceeded the recommended duration mandated by the national neonatal protocol. We recommend the development of antibiotic stewardship programs in neonatal units in Rwanda to prevent the adverse effects which may be caused by inappropriate or excessive use of antibiotics.","Cartledge, Peter Thomas; Ruzibuka, Fidel Shofel; Rutagarama, Florent; Rutare, Samuel; Rogo, Tanya",Afr Health Sci,,211

In this paper, we investigate the detection problem of ultra high-order quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) FTN signaling where we exploit a mathematical programming technique based on the alternating directions multiplier method (ADMM). The proposed ADMM sequence estimation (ADMMSE) FTN signaling detector demonstrates an excellent trade-off between performance and computational effort enabling, for the first time in the FTN signaling literature, successful detection and SE gains for QAM modulation orders as high as 64K (65,536). The complexity of the proposed ADMMSE detector is polynomial in the length of the transmit symbols sequence and its sensitivity to the modulation order increases only logarithmically. Simulation results show that for 16-QAM, the proposed ADMMSE FTN signaling detector achieves comparable SE gains to the generalized approach semidefinite relaxation-based sequence estimation (GASDRSE) FTN signaling detector, but at an experimentally evaluated much lower computational time. Simulation results additionally show SE gains for modulation orders starting from 4-QAM, or quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), up to and including 64K-QAM when compared to conventional Nyquist signaling. The very low computational effort required makes the proposed ADMMSE detector a practically promising FTN signaling detector for both low order and ultra high-order QAM FTN signaling systems.","Ibrahim, Ahmed; Bedeer, Ebrahim; Yanikomeroglu, Halim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00805v1.pdf,211

We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have a higher mortality-rate (390 of 1012 = 39%) compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin (270 of 1939 = 14%), presenting a risk ratio of 2.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [2.42, 3.16]; p = 4.45e-52). This difference persists even after balancing on a number of covariates including demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and method of oxygenation, with an increased mortality rate on discharge from the hospital of 37% (268 of 733) for unfractionated heparin versus 22% (154 of 711) for enoxaparin, presenting a risk ratio of 1.69 (95% CI: [1.42, 2.00]; p = 1.5e-8).

We used a longitudinal design (Nâ¯=â¯1615, 26% with mental disorder history). Successive samplings were performed from three days before quarantine start and across quarantine phases of up to 103-days duration. Follow-up was one month later. Sex (woman) and age (younger) were significant predictors of worse mental health only in college students without mental disorder background. Having any suicidal behavior background significantly predicted worse mental health in college students both with and without mental disorder history. Loneliness and region of residence were not statistically significant. In the between-groups comparisons, college students having mental disorder background had worse mental health than those without such a background. However, in the within-subject comparisons, no statistically significant changes occurred across time in the mental health of college students having mental disorder history. Conversely, significant changes occurred in those without such a background, but only when the interaction between time and quarantine duration was considered. Worsening mental health occurred during the most heavily restrictive quarantine phases, while some of the remissions occurred during the longest, but less restrictive ones.","López Steinmetz, Lorena Cecilia; Fong, Shao Bing; Godoy, Juan Carlos",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,211

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based retrospective cohort studies. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Men diagnosed with impaired fertility status and subsequently observed to determine incidence risk in developing testicular cancer (TCa) or prostate cancer (PCa). INTERVENTION(S): Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pooled risk ratio (RR) differences among male factor infertility subjects compared with a fertile control population, and meta-regression analysis according to age at baseline, mean follow-up, range of study time, and year of publication. RESULT(S): Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were critically examined. Four studies examined male infertility and TCa (n = 161,634; 174 TCa cases), and four examined infertility in relation to PCa (n = 183,950 men; 377 PCa cases) from 1963 to 2014. The pooled RR was 2.033 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.66-2.48); heterogeneity: Q = 3.04 (degree of freedom [df] = 3); I2 = 1.55% for TCa and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.17-2.4); Q = 23.3(df = 3); I2 = 87.1% for PCa. CONCLUSION(S): Male infertility was associated with a subsequent risk of both TCa and PCa. Although the clinical significance of these findings remains uncertain, future studies should evaluate the underlying mechanisms to determine whether testis and prostate screening practices should be altered in men with male infertility.

This study aims to explore the effect of alcohol intensity and duration, as joint continuous exposures, on HNC risk. METHODS: Data from 26 case-control studies in the INHANCE Consortium were used, including never and current drinkers who drunk &#8804;10 drinks/day for &#8804;54 years (24234 controls, 4085 oral cavity, 3359 oropharyngeal, 983 hypopharyngeal and 3340 laryngeal cancers). The dose-response relationship between the risk and the joint exposure to drinking intensity and duration was investigated through bivariate regression spline models, adjusting for potential confounders, including tobacco smoking. RESULTS: For all subsites, cancer risk steeply increased with increasing drinks/day, with no appreciable threshold effect at lower intensities. For each intensity level, the risk of oral cavity, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers did not vary according to years of drinking, suggesting no effect of duration. For oropharyngeal cancer, the risk increased with durations up to 28 years, flattening thereafter. The risk peaked at the higher levels of intensity and duration for all subsites (odds ratio = 7.95 for oral cavity, 12.86 for oropharynx, 24.96 for hypopharynx and 6.60 for larynx). CONCLUSIONS: Present results further encourage the reduction of alcohol intensity to mitigate HNC risk.","Di Credico, Gioia; Polesel, Jerry; Dal Maso, Luigino; Pauli, Francesco; Torelli, Nicola; Luce, Daniele; Radoï, Loredana; Matsuo, Keitaro; Serraino, Diego; Brennan, Paul; Holcatova, Ivana; Ahrens, Wolfgang; Lagiou, Pagona; Canova, Cristina; Richiardi, Lorenzo; Healy, Claire M; Kjaerheim, Kristina; Conway, David I; Macfarlane, Gary J; Thomson, Peter; Agudo, Antonio; Znaor, Ariana; Franceschi, Silvia; Herrero, Rolando; Toporcov, Tatiana N; Moyses, Raquel A; Muscat, Joshua; Negri, Eva; Vilensky, Marta; Fernandez, Leticia; Curado, Maria Paula; Menezes, Ana; Daudt, Alexander W; Koifman, Rosalina; Wunsch-Filho, Victor; Olshan, Andrew F; Zevallos, Jose P; Sturgis, Erich M; Li, Guojun; Levi, Fabio; Zhang, Zuo-Feng; Morgenstern, Hal; Smith, Elaine; Lazarus, Philip; La Vecchia, Carlo; Garavello, Werner; Chen, Chu; Schwartz, Stephen M; Zheng, Tongzhang; Vaughan, Thomas L",Br. j. cancer,,211

A survey including 24 questions was emailed to dentists in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and South Tyrol (Italy). Questions regarding dentists' field of work, working hours, treatments performed, personal protective equipment and protocols, and economic consequences were asked. 1731 participants were included. 30.4% of participants worked mainly in Austria, 60.8% in Germany, 6% in Switzerland and 2.1% in South Tyrol. A country-specific analysis for the situation of South Tyrol was not possible due to the low participation; 53.7% of German, 45.5% of Austrian, and 11.7% of Swiss respondents reduced their working hours; 42.8% of Austrian, 41.5% of Swiss, and 17.3% of German participants closed their offices temporarily; 52.2% of respondents provided emergency service including pain management, restorations/temporaries, and denture repairs.

We asked for their experiences during COVID-19 confinement regarding everyday life, AN symptoms, and treatment. We used thematic analysis to interpret the data. The main themes identified from the patients' interviews involved restrictions of personal freedom (i.e., leading to tension between patients and family members, reduced motivation to work on recovery), interruption of the treatment routine (emerging risks through self-monitored weight, challenges/opportunities of teletherapy), changes in AN symptoms (more exposure to triggering situations), COVID-19-related fears, and compulsions but also potential opportunities (less stress, better family relationships). The parents discussed changes in daily routines as negative (challenges in maintaining day structures) and positive (more family time, ""slowing down""). They expressed reservations about reduced outpatient monitoring and increased teletherapy and discussed challenges in keeping contact with the child and clinicians during inpatient treatment. Moreover, the parents discussed deteriorations and improvements in the patients' psychopathology. Clinical implications from these in-depth insights include the importance of strengthening communication between changing staff cohorts, patients, and parents;motivational work;and joint weight monitoring with the therapist.","Zeiler, M.; Wittek, T.; Kahlenberg, L.; Grobner, E.

Given that cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity around the world and that several trials have reported severe cardiovascular damage in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, a substantial number of COVID-19 patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases need to continue their medications in order to improve myocardial contractility and to prevent the onset of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including heart failure. Some of the current life-saving medications may actually simultaneously expose patients to a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key counter regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the main entry gate of SARS-CoV-2 into human host cells and an established drug target to prevent heart failure. In fact, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid antagonists may augment ACE2 levels to protect organs from angiotensin II overload. Elevated ACE2 expression on the host cell surface might facilitate viral entrance, at the same time sudden nonadherence to these medications triggers MACEs. Hence, safety issues in the use of RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with cardiac dysfunction remain an unsolved dilemma and need paramount attention. Although ACE2 generally plays an adaptive role in both healthy subjects and patients with systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction, we conducted a literature appraisal on its maladaptive role. Understanding the exact role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients at risk of heart failure is needed to safely manage RAS inhibitors in frail and non-frail critically ill patients.","Razeghian-Jahromi, Iman; Zibaeenezhad, Mohammad Javad; Lu, Zhibing; Zahra, Elyaspour; Mahboobeh, Razmkhah; Lionetti, Vicenzo",Heart fail. rev,,211

AmB which is belonged to the polyene group has a wide spectrum in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity against fungi and parasites, resistance to AmB is rare despite extensive use. Recently, some studies focused on the potential antimicrobial action of AmB against some enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and rubella virus. Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA nucleic acid viruses that have club-like spikes, characterized by a distinctive replication strategy; they are round and sometimes pleomorphic shapes. COVID-19 is regarding the new genera of coronaviridae that appear the first time in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. Due to the continuous spreading of the novel COVID-19 with the exponential rise in death numbers, new therapeutic development is urgent, in general, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines for 2019-novel coronavirus. Hence, this review may serve as an impetus for researchers working in the field of medical microbiology, vaccination, and antiviral drug design by discussion the most recent information about the antiviral action of AmB against COVID-19 infection as well as trying to a deep understanding of major properties, mechanisms of action, immune system responses, and antimicrobial efficiency of AmB. Since AmB is expected to alter the structure of the viral envelope, membrane integrity of cells, and internal cellular organelles, besides its other unique properties such as host immunomodulatory effects, so this review suggested that AmB as an effective anti-fungi drug thus may hold the promise of formulating a novel therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.","Al-Khikani, Falah Hasan Obayes",Ann Thorac Med,,211

We examined 25,381 German SARS-CoV-2 cases, including 6110 from test centres attended by pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly-symptomatic (PAMS) subjects, 9519 who were hospitalised, and 1533 B.1.1.7 lineage infections. The youngest had mean log10 viral load 0.5 (or less) lower than older subjects and an estimated ~78% of the peak cell culture replication probability, due in part to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 109 copies per swab were found in 8% of subjects, one-third of whom were PAMS, with mean age 37.6. We estimate 4.3 days from onset of shedding to peak viral load (8.1) and cell culture isolation probability (0.75). B.1.1.7 subjects had mean log10 viral load 1.05 higher than non-B.1.1.7, with estimated cell culture replication probability 2.6 times higher.","Jones, Terry C; Biele, Guido; Mühlemann, Barbara; Veith, Talitha; Schneider, Julia; Beheim-Schwarzbach, Jörn; Bleicker, Tobias; Tesch, Julia; Schmidt, Marie Luisa; Sander, Leif Erik; Kurth, Florian; Menzel, Peter; Schwarzer, Rolf; Zuchowski, Marta; Hofmann, Jörg; Krumbholz, Andi; Stein, Angela; Edelmann, Anke; Corman, Victor Max; Drosten, Christian",Science (Wash.),,211

The aim of this study was to look for the warning index in severe COVID-19 patients. We investigated 43 adult patients with COVID-19. The patients were classified into mild group (28 patients) and severe group (15 patients). A comparison of the hematological parameters between the mild and severe groups showed significant differences in interleukin-6 (IL-6), d-dimer (d-D), glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein (P < .05). The optimal threshold and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of IL-6 were 24.3 and 0.795 µg/L, respectively, while those of d-D were 0.28 and 0.750 µg/L, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of IL-6 combined with d-D was 0.840. The specificity of predicting the severity of COVID-19 during IL-6 and d-D tandem testing was up to 93.3%, while the sensitivity of IL-6 and d-D by parallel test in the severe COVID-19 was 96.4%. IL-6 and d-D were closely related to the occurrence of severe COVID-19 in the adult patients, and their combined detection had the highest specificity and sensitivity for early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 patients, which has important clinical value.","Gao, Yong; Li, Tuantuan; Han, Mingfeng; Li, Xiuyong; Wu, Dong; Xu, Yuanhong; Zhu, Yulin; Liu, Yan; Wang, Xiaowu; Wang, Linding",J Med Virol,,211

With health systems reliant on the health of their workforce, the importance of protection against disease transmission in healthcare workers (HCWs) is clear. This study collated responses from several countries, provided by clinicians familiar with practice in each location, to identify areas of best practice and policy so as to build consensus of those measures that might reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to HCWs at work. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was designed with ten open and closed questions and sent to a representative sample. The sample was selected on a convenience basis of 27 senior surgeons, members of an international surgical society, who were all frontline workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was reported according to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist. Results: Responses were received by all 27 surgeons from 22 countries across six continents. A number of the study respondents reported COVID-19-related infection and mortality in HCWs in their countries. Differing areas of practice and policy were identified and organized into themes including the specification of units receiving COVID-19 patients, availability and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), other measures to reduce staff exposure, and communicating with and supporting HCWs. Areas more specific to surgery also identified some variation in practice and policy in relation to visitors to the hospital, the outpatient department, and in the operating room for both non-urgent and emergency care. Conclusion: COVID-19 presents a disproportionate risk to HCWs, potentially resulting in a diminished health system capacity, and consequently an impairment to population health. Implementation of these recommendations at an international level could provide a framework to reduce this burden.","Hussain, Zaamin B; Shoman, Haitham; Yau, Peter W P; Thevendran, Gowreeson; Randelli, Filippo; Zhang, Mingzhu; Kocher, Mininder S; Norrish, Alan; Khanduja, Vikas",Bone Jt Open,,211

We describe a novel tool, Cross-Barcode(P,Q), that, given a pair of distributions in a high-dimensional space, tracks multiscale topology spacial discrepancies between manifolds on which the distributions are concentrated. Based on the Cross-Barcode, we introduce the Manifold Topology Divergence score (MTop-Divergence) and apply it to assess the performance of deep generative models in various domains: images, 3D-shapes, time-series, and on different datasets: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, FFHQ, chest X-ray images, market stock data, ShapeNet. We demonstrate that the MTop-Divergence accurately detects various degrees of mode-dropping, intra-mode collapse, mode invention, and image disturbance. Our algorithm scales well (essentially linearly) with the increase of the dimension of the ambient high-dimensional space. It is one of the first TDA-based practical methodologies that can be applied universally to datasets of different sizes and dimensions, including the ones on which the most recent GANs in the visual domain are trained. The proposed method is domain agnostic and does not rely on pre-trained networks.","Barannikov, Serguei; Trofimov, Ilya; Sotnikov, Grigorii; Trimbach, Ekaterina; Korotin, Alexander; Filippov, Alexander; Burnaev, Evgeny",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04024v1.pdf,211

360476,Debate: Promoting capabilities for young people's agency in the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"The implementation of sustainability practices in the tourism system requires the partic-ipation of a variety of actors. While much research has focused on supply-side issues associated with sustainable tourism, there has been less focus on supply-side issues associated with consumer behaviour and business-related travel. This paper addresses the behaviours of this significant market segment. As behavioural change is seen as a key mechanism for achieving emission reduction, this paper focuses on behaviours of business travels from four countries: Canada, Switzerland, Russia and the U.S., using values-attitudes-behaviour (VAB) theory. We employ Principal Components Analysis to reduce the variables down to four factors and related factor scores. Stepwise multiple linear regression was then used to measure causal associations. The findings show how national cultures, demographics and values influence (although at different levels) the sustainable attitudes and behaviour of business travellers. These results have implications for future corporate travel policy. The recent impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is also addressed. © 2021 by the authors.

368807,Medical conspiracy theories: cognitive science and implications for ethics,2020,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 with millions of cases reported globally in the succeeding months. Initial hospitalisation strives to minimise multisystem organ failure and of those that survive, individuals can present with profound rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this case series is to describe occupational therapy (OT) and special technology considerations for three male Veteran patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This is a descriptive case series using a retrospective electronic health record review at a Veterans Administration hospital. The case series includes three male Veterans with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ages 69-78) who were referred to OT. The cases were selected to demonstrate the novel use of technology and strategies to reduce the risk of transmission. In two of three of our cases, we describe acute rehabilitation with a focus on activity tolerance, participation in occupations, and discharge planning. In all cases, we measured vital signs and activity tolerance as primary outcomes. Results and conclusions: The findings suggest that outcome measures focussing on activity tolerance to maintain stable vital signs during the recovery phase is central to the progression of activities. We observed in our cases that the Person-Environment-Occupation-Performance (PEOP) model can guide practice and complement the medical model in management of these patients. We utilised technology to engage family members in the rehabilitation care and minimise exposure risks. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Acute occupational therapy for rehabilitation early in the recovery of Cornavirus-2019 can be guided by the Person-Occupation-Environment-Performance model as seen in this case series of three Veteran patients. Assistive technology can serve dual roles in supporting the rehabilitation of individuals with Cornavirus-2019 and lowering the risk of virus transmission to staff.","Rich, Tonya; Hicks, Brandon; Dahl, Abigail; Sullivan, Elle; Barrett, Benjamin; Bedore, Beau",Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,,211

This study aims to estimate the epidemiological trends of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevalence and mortality using the advanced &#945;-Sutte Indicator, and its prediction accuracy level was compared with the most frequently adopted autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method. Time-series analysis was performed based on the total confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the world, Brazil, Peru, Canada and Chile between 27 February 2020 and 30 June 2020. By comparing the prediction reliability indices, including the root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean error rate, mean absolute percentage error and root mean square percentage error, the &#945;-Sutte Indicator was found to produce lower forecasting error rates than the ARIMA model in all data apart from the prevalence testing set globally. The &#945;-Sutte Indicator can be recommended as a useful tool to nowcast and forecast the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality of these regions except for the prevalence around the globe in the near future, which will help policymakers to plan and prepare health resources effectively.

It is becoming increasingly appreciated that IgA+ PC are not constrained to mucosal barrier sites. Rather, IgA+ PC may leave these sites where they provide both host defense and immunoregulatory function. In this review, we will outline how IgA+ PC are generated within the mucosae and how they subsequently migrate to their ""classical"" effector site, the gut lamina propria. From there we provide examples of IgA+ PC displacement from the gut to other parts of the body, referencing examples during homeostasis and inflammation. Lastly, we will speculate on mechanisms of IgA+ PC displacement to other tissues. Our aim is to provide a new perspective on how IgA+ PC are truly fantastic beasts of the immune system and identify new places to find them.","Isho, Baweleta; Florescu, Alexandra; Wang, Angela A; Gommerman, Jennifer L",Immunol. rev,,211
375964,Review of the current empirical literature on using videoconferencing to deliver individual psychotherapies to adults with mental health problems,2021,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been largely used and investigated as therapy for COVID-19 across various settings at a total dose usually ranging from 2400 mg to 9600 mg. In Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (total 2400 mg over 5 days) was recommended for hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective analysis of in-hospital mortality in the Belgian national COVID-19 hospital surveillance data. Patients treated either with HCQ monotherapy and supportive care (HCQ group) were compared with patients treated with supportive care only (no-HCQ group) using a competing risks proportional hazards regression with discharge alive as competing risk, adjusted for demographic and clinical features with robust standard errors. Of 8075 patients with complete discharge data on 24 May 2020 and diagnosed before 1 May 2020, 4542 received HCQ in monotherapy and 3533 were in the no-HCQ group. Death was reported in 804/4542 (17.7%) and 957/3533 (27.1%), respectively. In the multivariable analysis, mortality was lower in the HCQ group compared with the no-HCQ group [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.684, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.617-0.758]. Compared with the no-HCQ group, mortality in the HCQ group was reduced both in patients diagnosed &#8804;5 days (n = 3975) and >5 days (n = 3487) after symptom onset [aHR = 0.701 (95% CI 0.617-0.796) and aHR = 0.647 (95% CI 0.525-0.797), respectively]. Compared with supportive care only, low-dose HCQ monotherapy was independently associated with lower mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated early or later after symptom onset.","Catteau, Lucy; Dauby, Nicolas; Montourcy, Marion; Bottieau, Emmanuel; Hautekiet, Joris; Goetghebeur, Els; van Ierssel, Sabrina; Duysburgh, Els; Van Oyen, Herman; Wyndham-Thomas, Chloé; Van Beckhoven, Dominique",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,211

375979,The Near-Term Future of Health Care Reform,2021,"Epidemiological data shows a discrepancy in COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes with some regions being more heavily affected than others. However, the factors that determine host susceptibility and pathogenicity remain elusive. An increasing number of publications highlight the role of Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the susceptibility of the host cell to SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of viral spike protein via the host cell's TMPRSS2 enzyme activity mediates viral entry into the host cell. The enzyme synthesis is regulated by the TMPRSS2 gene, which has also been implicated in the entry mechanisms of previously reported Coronavirus infections. In this review, we have investigated the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and disease susceptibility dependence on the TMPRSS2 gene as expressed in various population groups. We further discuss how the differential expression of this gene in various ethnic groups can affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection and Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 outcomes. Moreover, promising new TMPRSS2 protease blockers and inhibitors are discussed for COVID-19 treatment.","Abbasi, Asim Z; Kiyani, Dania A; Hamid, Syeda M; Saalim, Muhammad; Fahim, Ammad; Jalal, Nasir",J Med Virol,,211

380902,36.1 a School Yoga Pilot Program to Promote Psychosocial Well Being among High School Students,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mortality impact of COVID-19 has thus far been described in terms of crude death counts. We aimed to calibrate the scale of the modelled mortality impact of COVID-19 using age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contribution against other, socially determined, causes of death in order to inform governments and the public. METHODS: We compared mortality attributable to suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality with estimates of mortality from an infectious disease model of COVID-19. We calculated age-standardised mortality rates and life expectancy contributions for the UK and its constituent nations. RESULTS: Mortality from a fully unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be responsible for a negative life expectancy contribution of -5.96 years for the UK. This is reduced to -0.33 years in the fully mitigated scenario. The equivalent annual life expectancy contributions of suicide, drug poisoning and socioeconomic inequality-related deaths are -0.25, -0.20 and -3.51 years, respectively. The negative impact of fully unmitigated COVID-19 on life expectancy is therefore equivalent to 24 years of suicide deaths, 30 years of drug poisoning deaths and 1.7 years of inequality-related deaths for the UK. CONCLUSION: Fully mitigating COVID-19 is estimated to prevent a loss of 5.63 years of life expectancy for the UK. Over 10 years, there is a greater negative life expectancy contribution from inequality than around six unmitigated COVID-19 pandemics. To achieve long-term population health improvements it is therefore important to take this opportunity to introduce post-pandemic economic policies to 'build back better'.","McCartney, Gerry; Leyland, Alastair; Walsh, David; Ruth, Dundas",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,211
381718,COVID-19 effect on mental health: patients and workforce,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) causes around 10 hospitalisations per 1000 child-years, each associated with an average 13 non-routine days experienced and more than 4 parent workdays lost. In adults, steroid treatment shortens time to clinical stabilisation without an increase in complications in patients with CAP. However, despite promising data from observational studies, there is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of steroids. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The KIDS-STEP trial is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial of betamethasone treatment on outcome of hospitalised children with CAP. Children are enrolled in paediatric emergency departments of hospitals across Switzerland and randomised to adjunct oral betamethasone for 2 days or matching placebo in addition to standard of care treatment. The co-primary outcomes are the proportion of children clinically stable 48 hours after randomisation and the proportion of children with CAP-related readmission within 28 days after randomisation. Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, time away from routine childcare and healthcare utilisation and total antibiotic prescriptions within 28 days from randomisation.Each of the co-primary outcomes will be analysed separately. We will test clinical stability rates using a proportion test; to test non-inferiority in readmission rates, we will construct 1-&#945; % CI of the estimated difference and test if it contains the pre-defined margin of 7%. Success is conditional on both tests. A simulation-based sample size estimation determined that recruiting 700 patients will ensure a power of 80% for the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial protocol and materials were approved by ethics committees in Switzerland (lead: Ethikkommission Nordwest und Zentralschweiz) and the regulatory authority Swissmedic. Participants and caregivers provide informed consent prior to study procedures commencing. The trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and at national and international conferences. Key messages will also be disseminated via press and social media where appropriate.

METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, we analyze all consecutive patients admitted for electrophysiological procedures during the COVID-19 lockdown in the Tuscany region of Italy, comparing them to patients hospitalized in the corresponding period of the previous year. RESULTS: The impact of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmia management was impressive, with a reduction of more than 50% in all kinds of procedures. A gender gap was observed, with a more relevant reduction for female patients. Arrhythmic urgencies requiring a device implant showed a reduced time from symptoms to first medical contact but the time from first medical contact to procedure was significantly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Hospitals need to consider how outbreaks may affect health systems beyond the immediate infection. Routine activity should be based on a risk assessment between the prompt performance of procedure and its postponement.

388530,Using Internet-Based Psychological Measurement to Capture the Deteriorating Community Mental Health Profile During COVID-19: Observational Study,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To understand the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on persons with alcohol use disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: From a total of 455 titles on COVID-19 and alcohol, 227 abstracts were screened, and 95 articles were reviewed (on November 25th, 2020). The immediate effect was an increase in alcohol related emergencies including alcohol withdrawal, related suicides, and methanol toxicity. Although there are mixed findings with respect to changes in the quantity of drinking, there are reports of binge/heavy drinking during the lockdown as well as relapse postlockdown. Psychological, social, biological, economic and policy-related factors appear to influence the changes in drinking. Although preliminary data suggest no change in alcohol use among persons with comorbid mental illness, findings in this population are presently limited. Among patients with alcohol related liver disease, outcomes appear worse and caution is warranted with the use of medications. Alcohol also appears to increases the risk of COVID-19 infection and complicates its course.Although some nations banned alcohol sales completely during lockdown, others declared it as an essential commodity, resulting in different problems across countries. Alcohol use has added to the burden of the problem particularly among vulnerable groups like the adolescents, elderly, patients with cancer, as well as health professionals. Services for patients with alcohol use disorders have been affected. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on alcohol use, with an increase in alcohol related emergencies, changes in alcohol use patterns, increased risk of contracting COVID-19, effect on alcohol policies and sales, and an effect on vulnerable groups. It is essential to understand and respond to the current situation, intervene early, and prevent further repercussions of the pandemic.Video abstract link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJWtIs6e554PryKWhdma4VB--mjSZq1C/view?usp=sharing.","Murthy, Pratima; Narasimha, Venkata Lakshmi",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,211

However, experimental work examining the direct actions of chloroquine on mechanoreceptive hair cells in common experimental models is lacking. This study examines the effects of chloroquine on hair cells using two common experimental models: the zebrafish lateral line and neonatal mouse cochlear cultures. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine for 1 h or 24 h, and hair cells assessed by antibody staining. A significant, dose-dependent reduction in the number of surviving hair cells was seen across conditions for both exposure periods. Hydroxychloroquine showed similar toxicity. In mouse cochlear cultures, chloroquine damage was specific to outer hair cells in tissue from the cochlear basal turn, consistent with susceptibility to other ototoxic agents. These findings suggest a need for future studies employing hearing and balance monitoring during exposure to chloroquine and related compounds, particularly with interest in these compounds as therapeutics against viral infections including coronavirus.","Davis, Samantha N; Wu, Patricia; Camci, Esra D; Simon, Julian A; Rubel, Edwin W; Raible, David W",Hear Res,,211

397162,Paying attention to the measures used in psychiatric research and services,2021,"Computer-Aided Diagnosis has shown stellar performance in providing accurate medical diagnoses across multiple testing modalities (medical images, electrophysiological signals, etc.). While this field has typically focused on fully harvesting the signal provided by a single (and generally extremely reliable) modality, fewer efforts have utilized imprecise data lacking reliable ground truth labels. In this unsupervised, noisy setting, the robustification and quantification of the diagnosis uncertainty become paramount, thus posing a new challenge: how can we combine multiple sources of information -- often themselves with vastly varying levels of precision and uncertainty -- to provide a diagnosis estimate with confidence bounds? Motivated by a concrete application in antibody testing, we devise a Stochastic Expectation-Maximization algorithm that allows the principled integration of heterogeneous, and potentially unreliable, data types. Our Bayesian formalism is essential in (a) flexibly combining these heterogeneous data sources and their corresponding levels of uncertainty, (b) quantifying the degree of confidence associated with a given diagnostic, and (c) dealing with the missing values that typically plague medical data. We quantify the potential of this approach on simulated data, and showcase its practicality by deploying it on a real COVID-19 immunity study.","Donnat, Claire; Miolane, Nina; Bunbury, Frederick de St Pierre; Kreindler, Jack",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13847v1.pdf,211

In the infectious context, exploring the innate and adaptive immune responses will help to investigate their contribution to viral control or toxicity. After vaccination, immunomonitoring of the correlate(s) and surrogate(s) of protection is a major asset for measuring vaccine immune efficacy. Conventional immunomonitoring methods include antibody-based technologies that are easy to use. However, promising sensitive high-throughput technologies allowed the emergence of holistic approaches. This raises the question of data integration methods and tools. These approaches allow us to increase our knowledge on immune mechanisms as well as the identification of key effectors of the immune response. However, the depiction of relevant findings requires a well-rounded consideration beforehand about the hypotheses, conception, organization and objectives of the immunomonitoring. Therefore, well-standardized and comprehensive studies fuel insight to design more efficient, rationale-based vaccines and therapeutics to fight against infectious diseases. Hence, we will illustrate this review with examples of the immunomonitoring approaches used during vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adam, L.; Rosenbaum, P.; Bonduelle, O.; Combadiere, B.",Vaccines (Basel),,211

This may be due to a hypercoagulable state induced by the severe inflammation that results from the SAR-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to determine hypercoagulable states' incidence based on thromboelastography study and its association with thrombotic events in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fifty-two COVID-19 patients who had thromboelastography study were retrospectively included. All patients received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The hypercoagulable state was observed in 16 patients (30.8%). Among them, maximum amplitude and a-angle were elevated in 75% and 25%, respectively. Reaction time and K were low in only 12.5% for both of them. Inflammatory and coagulation markers, as well as thromboprophylaxis regimens, were not associated with a hypercoagulable state. Fourteen patients (27%) experienced a total of 16 thrombotic events, including 8 (57%) deep venous thrombosis, 6 (43%) pulmonary embolism, and 2 (14.3%) arterial thrombosis. The hypercoagulable state was not significantly associated with thrombotic events. In summary, we observed a lower rate of hypercoagulable state on thromboelastography study in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Also, the hypercoagulable state was not associated with the occurrence of thrombotic events.","Salem, Nouran; Atallah, Bassam; El Nekidy, Wasim S; Sadik, Ziad G; Park, Woosup Michael; Mallat, Jihad",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,211
399094,"Exploring women's childbirth experiences and perceptions of delivery care in peri-urban settings in Nairobi, Kenya",2021,"BACKGROUND: Because of the absence of a specific diagnostic test and pathognomonic clinical features, physicians must rely on the presence of specific clinical criteria and laboratory data that support the diagnosis of KD. To help clinicians distinguish KD, KDSS, septic shock, and TSS earlier, we suggest differential diagnosis and treatment guideline. METHODS: Medical records of immunocompetent patients who were admitted to the pediatric department with a diagnosis of KDSS, septic shock or TSS (SS group) were retrospectively reviewed. In addition, KD patients were selected by seasonal matching to each case of KDSS patient by date of admission (± 2 weeks). RESULTS: There were 13 patients with KDSS, 35 patients with SS group, and 91 patients with KD. In comparison between KDSS and septic shock group, KDSS group had significantly higher rate of coronary aneurysm incidence, and higher left ventricle dysfunction rate. In comparison between KDSS and TSS, patients with KDSS had a significantly higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and significantly lower creatinine. Receiver operation characteristic curve revealed that the optimal ESR cut off value for determining the KDSS was 56.0 (sensitivity 75.0%, specificity of 100.0%) and the optimal creatinine cut off value for determining the TSS was 0.695 (sensitivity 76.9%, specificity 84.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical symptoms, laboratory finding, echocardiography, and culture studies can be used to differentiate KD, KDSS, septic shock and TSS.","Park, Woo Young; Lee, Sang Yun; Kim, Gi Beom; Song, Mi Kyoung; Kwon, Hye Won; Bae, Eun Jung; Choi, Eun Hwa; Park, June Dong",BMC Pediatr,,211
399643,Mental Health Outcomes Associated with COVID-19 Pandemic in a Group of Health Care Professionals,2021,"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV), also termed camel flu, is a new viral infection that first reported in the year 2012 in the Middle East region and further spread during the last seven years. MERS CoV is characterized by its high mortality rate among different human coronaviruses. MERS CoV polymerase shares more than 20% sequence identity with the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-structural 5b (NS5b) RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Despite the low sequence identity, the active site is conserved between the two proteins, with two consecutive aspartates that are crucial in the nucleotide transfer reaction. In this study, seven nucleotide inhibitors have been tested against MERS CoV RdRp using molecular modeling and docking simulations, from which four are novel compounds. Molecular Dynamics Simulation for 260 nanoseconds is performed on the MERS CoV RdRp model to test the effect of protein dynamics on the binding affinities to the tested nucleotide inhibitors. Results support the hypothesis of using the anti-polymerases (Anti-HCV drugs) against MERS CoV RdRp as a potent candidates. Besides four novel compounds are suggested as a seed for high performance inhibitors against MERS CoV RdRp.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Objective: We evaluated the clinical performance of two Korean SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kits available in South America, AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, South Korea) and Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, South Korea), for RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using the CDC protocol as a gold standard. Results: We found strong differences among both kits clinical performance and analytical sensitivity; while the Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay has sensitivity of 96.5% and an estimated limit of detection of 4,000 copies/ml, the AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex RT-PCR kit has a sensitivity of 75.5% and limit of detection estimated to be bigger than 20,000 copies/ml. Conclusions: AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex RT-PCR kit and Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay are both made in South Korea but EUA by Korean CDC was only granted to the later. Our results support that Korean CDC EUA should be considered as a quality control proxy for Korean SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kits prior to importation by developing countries to guarantee high sensitivity diagnosis.","Freire-Paspuel, Byron; Garcia-Bereguiain, Miguel Angel",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,211

The aim of this study was to assess the early impact of nationwide school closure (March-May 2020) and social distancing for COVID-19 on the number of inpatients with major childhood infectious diseases in Japan. Using data from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination system in Japan, we identified patients aged 15 years or younger with admissions for a diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), influenza, gastrointestinal infection (GII), appendicitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) between July 2018 and June 2020. Changes in the trend of the weekly number of inpatients between the two periods were assessed using interrupted time-series analysis. A total of 75,053 patients in 210 hospitals were included. The overall weekly number of inpatients was decreased by 52.5%, 77.4%, and by 83.4% in the last week of March, April, and May 2020, respectively, when compared on a year-on-year basis. The estimated impact was a reduction of 581 (standard error 42.9) inpatients per week in the post-school-closure period (p < 0.001). The main part of the reduction was for pre-school children. Remarkable decreases in the number of inpatients with URI, LRTI, and GII were observed, while there were relatively mild changes in the other groups.Conclusion: We confirmed a marked reduction in the number of inpatients with childhood non-COVID-19 acute infections in the post-school-closure period. What is Known: â¢ Most countries have implemented social distancing measures to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). â¢ A large decrease in pediatric emergency visits has been reported from several countries after the social distancing.

406636,Children Exposed to IPV: Impact of Multiple Father Figures,2021,"Events in 2020 have sparked a reimagination of how both individuals and institutions should consider race, power, health, and marginalization in society. In a response to these developments, we examine the current and past limitations of the ways in which bioethicists have considered race and, more generally, discourses of marginalization. We argue that the foundational principle of justice necessitates that bioethics, as an institution, maintain an active voice against systemic injustice. To carry out this charge, bioethics as a field should promote alternative narratives-""counter storytelling""-to the mainstream voices that have traditionally been heard and accepted, largely without opposition. Additionally, we engage with both Post-Colonial and Critical Race Theory, which we believe are important tools for bioethics in pursuit of equity. Ultimately, we advocate for a proactive form of bioethics that actively resists and denounces injustice and which considers a much wider variety of voices about justice than bioethics has historically considered.","Mithani, Zamina; Cooper, Jane; Boyd, J Wesley",Am J Bioeth,,211

Extensive contract tracing during the outbreak has resulted in a dataset of epidemiologically linked cases. This data contains useful information about the transmission dynamics of the virus, its dependence on factors such as age, and its response to different control measures. We use Monte-Carlo network construction techniques to provide an estimate of the number of secondary cases for every individual infected during the outbreak. We then apply standard statistical techniques to quantify differences between groups of individuals. Children under 10 years old are significantly under-represented in the case data. Children infected fewer people on average and had a lower probability of transmitting the disease in comparison to adults and the elderly. Imported cases infected fewer people on average and also had a lower probability of transmitting than domestically acquired cases. Superspreading is a significant contributor to the epidemic dynamics, with 20% of cases among adults responsible for 65-85% of transmission. Subclinical cases infected fewer individuals than clinical cases. After controlling for outliers serial intervals were approximated with a normal distribution (µ = 4.4 days, &#963; = 4.7 days). Border controls and strong social distancing measures, particularly when targeted at superspreading, play a significant role in reducing the spread of COVID-19.","James, Alex; Plank, Michael J; Hendy, Shaun; Binny, Rachelle N; Lustig, Audrey; Steyn, Nic",PLoS One,,211

This study aimed to understand reasons behind students’ preferred mode of online learning during the pandemic and to explore the impact of online cooperative learning on students’ class participation by analyzing their voluntary comments. A qualitative content analysis identified three factors that are related to students’ decisions and motivation about participating in synchronous online classes: mutuality resulting from interaction, the impact of COVID-19 on their life and learning, and individual circumstances. This small-scale study was conducted under the unusual circumstance of the pandemic, and the quality of student interaction was excluded from the analysis. However, their enjoyment arising from interaction encouraged their participation in a synchronous class and discussion. They expressed themselves and listened to others attentively, creating a favorable climate for learning. Students’ positive interdependence observed in this study suggests that cooperative learning cultivates a classroom culture where students are willing to contribute without the fear of losing face. This study indicated that participation, cooperation, and active engagement create a positive feedback loop, promoting each aspect even in an online setting.","Sugino, Chie",Education Sciences,,211

Corona is an infection that originates from an unknown animal virus, which is of three known types and COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading since late 2019. Based on the SIR model, the virus can easily transmit from one person to several, causing an epidemic over time. Considering the characteristics and behavior of this virus, the current paper presents an optimization algorithm called Corona virus optimization (CVO) which is feasible, effective, and applicable. A set of benchmark functions evaluates the performance of this algorithm for discrete and continuous problems by comparing the results with those of other well-known optimization algorithms. The CVO algorithm aims to find suitable solutions to application problems by solving several continuous mathematical functions as well as three continuous and discrete applications. Experimental results denote that the proposed optimization method has a credible, reasonable, and acceptable performance.","Salehan, Alireza Deldari Arash",The Journal of Supercomputing,,211

ObjectiveTo prospectively characterize early SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding in persons with incident infection. DesignProspective cohort study. SettingSecondary data analysis from a multicenter study in the U.S. ParticipantsThe samples derived from a randomized controlled trial of 829 community-based asymptomatic participants recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with SARS-CoV-2. Participants collected daily mid-turbinate swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection by polymerase-chain-reaction and symptom diaries for 14-days. Persons with negative swab for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline who developed infection during the study were included in the analysis. ExposureLaboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcomes and measuresThe observed SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding characteristics were summarized and shedding trajectories were examined using a piece-wise linear mixed-effects modeling. Whole viral genome sequencing was performed on samples with cycle threshold (Ct)<34. ResultsNinety-seven persons (57% women, median age 37-years) developed incident infections during 14-days of follow-up. Two-hundred fifteen sequenced samples were assigned to 15 lineages that belonged to the G614 variant. Forty-two (43%), 18(19%), and 31(32%) participants had viral shedding for 1 day, 2-6 days, and [≥]7 days, with median peak viral load Ct of 38.5, 36.7, and 18.3, respectively. Six (6%) participants had 1-6 days of observed viral shedding with censored duration. The peak average viral load was observed on day 3 of viral shedding. The average Ct value was lower, indicating higher viral load, in persons reporting COVID-19 symptoms than asymptomatic. Using the statistical model, the median time from shedding onset to peak viral load was 1.4 days followed by a median of 9.7 days before clearance. Conclusions and RelevanceIncident SARS-CoV-2 G614 infection resulted in a rapid viral load peak followed by slower decay and positive correlation between peak viral load and shedding duration; duration of shedding was heterogeneous. This longitudinal evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 G614 variant with frequent molecular testing may serve as a reference for comparing emergent viral lineages to inform clinical trial designs and public health strategies to contain the spread of the virus.

Early light signs such as fever and nonproductive cough give a chance for early detection of disease and appropriate treatment. Imaging features that can be obtained using computed tomography (CT) images are of the most significant aspects of COVID-19 for screening, examination, therapy evaluation, and follow-up. This paper proposes an intelligent method for early detection of COVID-19 based on CT images and deep neural networks. In the developed method, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for automatic feature extraction from CT images and long-short term memory (LSTM) is used for final classification. Moreover, the Harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm is implemented for finding the best possible value of internal parameters of CNN and LSTM, such as the number of convolution/pooling layers, size, and the number of convolution kernels with the aim of increasing the classification accuracy. The developed method tested on data collected in Mashi Daneshvari Hospital in Iran. The obtained results showed that the developed method could detect the COVID-19 with high accuracy without needing radiologist experts.","Memon, M. H.; Golilarz, N. A.; Li, J.

We aimed to identify previously unreported immune markers able to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and to predict mild and severe disease. METHODS: An observational, prospective, multicentric study was conducted in patients with confirmed mild/moderate (n = 7) and severe (n = 19) COVID-19. Immunophenotyping of whole-blood leukocytes was performed in patients upon hospital ward or intensive care unit admission and in healthy controls (n = 25). Clinically relevant associations were identified through unsupervised analysis. RESULTS: Granulocytic (neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil) markers were enriched during COVID-19 and discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease. Increased counts of CD15+CD16+ neutrophils, decreased granulocytic expression of integrin CD11b, and Th2-related CRTH2 downregulation in eosinophils and basophils established a COVID-19 signature. Severity was associated with emergence of PD-L1 checkpoint expression in basophils and eosinophils. This granulocytic signature was accompanied by monocyte and lymphocyte immunoparalysis. Correlation with validated clinical scores supported pathophysiological relevance. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic markers of circulating granulocytes are strong discriminators between infected and uninfected individuals as well as between severity stages. COVID-19 alters the frequency and functional phenotypes of granulocyte subsets with emergence of CRTH2 as a disease biomarker.","Vitte, Joana; Diallo, Aïssatou Bailo; Boumaza, Asma; Lopez, Alexandre; Michel, Moïse; Allardet-Servent, Jérôme; Mezouar, Soraya; Sereme, Youssouf; Busnel, Jean-Marc; Miloud, Tewfik; Malergue, Fabrice; Morange, Pierre-Emmanuel; Halfon, Philippe; Olive, Daniel; Leone, Marc; Mege, Jean-Louis",J Infect Dis,,211

The increased incidence of fake and falsified product distribution is one of these problems with tremendous impact, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Up to a tenth of medicines including antibiotics and antimalarial drugs in the African market are considered falsified. Pandemics make this worse by creating an ecosystem of confusion, distraction, and vulnerability stemming from the pandemic as health systems become more stressed and the workload of individuals increased. These environments create opportunities for substandard and falsified medicines to be more easily introduced into the marketplace by unscrupulous operators. In this work we discuss some of the challenges with fake or falsified product distribution in the context of COVID-19 and proposed strategies to best manage this problem.","Tesfaye, Wubshet; Abrha, Solomon; Sinnollareddy, Mahipal; Arnold, Bruce; Brown, Andrew; Matthew, Cynthia; Oguoma, Victor M; Peterson, Gregory M; Thomas, Jackson",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,211

Recent findings: A range of investigations on the SARS-CoV-2 genomics, on its similarities with SARS-CoV-1, and with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been accomplished and the host immune dodging mechanisms by the SARS-CoV-2 have been unraveled which in turn led the scientists around the world to work rigorously on the vaccine development. Working with various vaccine platforms so far revealed the efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine as the most effective one as resulted through the clinical trials which resulted in 95% positive output. Summary: Although currently commercialized mRNA-1273 vaccine appears to be effective, still several points are to be pondered regarding the sustainability of vaccine efficacy against the rising variants of SARS-CoV-2.","Noor, Rashed",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,,211

428424,The Parents Are Not Alright: A Call for Caregiver Mental Health Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"We have developed periscope, a tool for the detection and quantification of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data. The translation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed ""subgenomic RNAs."" sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription, which relies on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF start codons and that of the TRS-L, which is located in the 5' UTR. TRS-L is immediately preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5' end of all sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, United Kingdom, and validated our findings using orthogonal data sets and in vitro cell systems. By using a simple local alignment to detect reads that contain the leader sequence, we were able to identify and quantify reads arising from canonical and noncanonical sgRNA. We were able to detect all canonical sgRNAs at the expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of recurrent noncanonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis. In VeroE6 ACE2+/- cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in orthogonal sequencing data sets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to all sequenced COVID-19 samples worldwide to provide comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA.","Parker, Matthew D; Lindsey, Benjamin B; Leary, Shay; Gaudieri, Silvana; Chopra, Abha; Wyles, Matthew; Angyal, Adrienn; Green, Luke R; Parsons, Paul; Tucker, Rachel M; Brown, Rebecca; Groves, Danielle; Johnson, Katie; Carrilero, Laura; Heffer, Joe; Partridge, David G; Evans, Cariad; Raza, Mohammad; Keeley, Alexander J; Smith, Nikki; Filipe, Ana Da Silva; Shepherd, James G; Davis, Chris; Bennett, Sahan; Sreenu, Vattipally B; Kohl, Alain; Aranday-Cortes, Elihu; Tong, Lily; Nichols, Jenna; Thomson, Emma C; Wang, Dennis; Mallal, Simon; de Silva, Thushan I",Genome Res,,211

433222,Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Schwannomas are uncommon tumors of the omentum with only 16 reported cases originating from the greater omentum in the literature. We report for the first time a synchronous presentation of an omental schwannoma and cervical cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old female presented with an abdominal mass and heavy vaginal bleeding. An 11.5 × 14.6 × 16.6 cm complex omental mass and 5.4 × 6.2 × 4.4 cm lobulated heterogeneous cervical mass were noted on CT-scan. Wide excision of the complex mass and radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection was performed. The final biopsy revealed benign omental schwannoma and poorly differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Schwannomas originating from the greater omentum are less common than in the lesser omentum due to the paucity of nervous tissue in the former. They can undergo malignant transformation and the most common presentation is abdominal pain/discomfort. Larger tumors may cause catastrophic bleeding. Prompt surgery should be offered and wide local excision with sufficient margins be performed when there is suspicion of malignancy. Schwannomas presenting with multiple or synchronous lesions are commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, and Carney's complex. Whether this co-occurrence is simply incidental or has a causal relationship remains to be established. CONCLUSION: Benign schwannoma of the greater omentum is rare and only requires complete tumor excision. However, surgeons should be aware that synchronous presentation of cervical cancer is possible and that thorough examination of both sites should be undertaken when either primary tumor presents.","Yap, Ralph Victor; Santos, Al Marion; Roble, Vincent Matthew",Int J Surg Case Rep,,211

442413,Predicting Health Disparities in Regions at Risk of Severe Illness to Inform Health Care Resource Allocation During Pandemics: Observational Study,2020,"ABSTRACT: Social distancing protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a rapid expansion of telemedicine. It has allowed patients to save time and money on clinic visits, and physicians to communicate with patients who live remotely. Telemedicine has also been valuable in plastic surgery during initial consultations, transfers, and follow up visits. However, given the often-sensitive nature of plastic surgery, the professionalism and expectations of telemedicine have to be reviewed. A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through October 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine and its use in plastic surgery. Data on the effectiveness, challenges, and professionalism of telemedicine were collected. Our review suggests that telemedicine can be an effective mode of communication in many realms of plastic surgery, including cleft care and craniofacial deformities. However, many plastic surgeons are unfamiliar with the existing platforms, and there are no clear guidelines on the most optimal platforms. Physicians have to recognize that patients might have low digital health literacy or may not even possess digital device for telemedicine. There also needs to be an overall improvement in patient education. Given that telemedicine use will continue to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant platforms and specific guidelines on telemedicine visits, such as undressing, chaperones, privacy matters, need to be established while maintaining a professional relationship between the patient and the physician.","Tam, Anson K; Kim, Minji; Mathew, Prakash J; Thaller, Seth R",J. craniofac. surg,,211

The FDA is yet to approve a vaccine for human novel coronavirus. Here, we developed a peptide-based vaccine and used high-throughput screening by molecular dynamics simulation to identify T-cell- and ß-cell-recognized epitopes for producing specific antibodies against SARS-nCoV-2. We construct ~ 12 P' antigenic epitope peptides to develop a more effective vaccine and identify specific antibodies. These epitope peptides selectively presented the best antigen presentation scores for both human pMHC class I and II alleles to develop a strong binding affinity. All antigens identified of SARS-nCoV-2 different proteins by each attached specific ~ 1-7 L linker adaptor were used to construct a broad single peripheral peptide vaccine. It is expected to be highly antigenic with a minimum allergic effect. As a result of these exciting outcomes, expressing a vaccine using the intimated peptide was highly promising and positive to be highly proposed as epitope-based peptide vaccine of specific antibody against SARS-nCoV-2 by initiating T cells and ß-cells. An in vitro study for the proposed peptide-based vaccine is mostly recommended. Further clinical trials are required to check the efficacy of this vaccine.","Abduljaleel, Zainularifeen; Al-Allaf, Faisal A; Aziz, Syed A",Biodes Manuf,,211

451148,Frontline Health Care Workers' Mental Workload During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"The COVID-19 coronavirus is currently spreading around the globe with limited treatment options available. This article presents the rationale for potentially using old drugs (emetine, other ipecac alkaloids or analogues) that have been used to treat amoebiasis in the treatment of COVID-19. Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. While EC50 concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs. Furthermore, based on the relative EC50s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with Entamoeba histolytica, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis. This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19. Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.","Bleasel, Martin D; Peterson, Gregory M",,,211

452101,Obesity and Hunger Threaten the Foundations of Child Health,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to an abrupt suspension of face-to-face teaching activities in higher education institutions across the globe. The instructors and faculty at most institutions have had to adapt, invent, and implement adjustments quickly to adopt an online learning environment. This has been an extraordinarily challenging time for both students and instructors, particularly as many were not aware of the affordances and weaknesses of the online learning environment before it was uptaken. Particularly for chemistry and related disciplines, this change in delivery mode is even more disruptive in courses that have laboratory components due to loss of access to laboratories. As a teaching community, it was our responsibility to respond quickly and effectively to students' learning needs during this unprecedented global crisis. In our course, we provided succinct pre-recorded lecture-videos by topic rather than live-streaming of lectures. The recordings were made available to students a minimum of 24 h before the scheduled lecture time. Students were then provided opportunities to attend live tutorial sessions (held on Zoom and live Q&A feature on Piazza) if they had any questions that they wanted to ask the lecturer directly. We believe that the asynchronous sessions were more equitable than synchronous ones. This meant that students with difficult and challenging home/learning environments (i.e., disruptions at home, work/family schedules, poor internet, limited access to devices, etc.) were minimally disadvantaged. The approach worked well in general for teaching chemistry to pharmacy students and we believe that it can be adopted for other subjects.","Pilkington, Lisa I; Hanif, Muhammad",Biochem Mol Biol Educ,,211

This paper proposes a simple bioreactor to mechanically stimulate up to three constructs for tendon and ligament repair, composed of a stainless-steel frame and an electric motor. METHODS: The deformation is produced by a cam wheel, whose eccentricity defines the maximum deformation. The test samples, braids of PLA seeded in surface with mouse fibroblasts, are immersed in the culture medium during mechanical stimulation. RESULTS: Its advantages over existing similar bioreactor designs include: easy renewal of the culture medium and an external electric motor to avoid heating and contamination issues. After 14 days of stretching, the culture samples showed enhanced cellular proliferation and cell fiber alignment in addition to higher production of type I collagen. The cells initially seeded on the braid surface migrated to the inside of the braid. CONCLUSION: Although the results obtained have a poor statistical basis, they do suggest that the bioreactor could be usefully applied to stimulate constructs for tendon and ligament repair. Anyway, further experiments should be conducted in the future.","Araque-Monrós, María Carmen; Gil-Santos, Luis; Pradas, Manuel Monleón; Más-Estellés, Jorge",Expert Rev Med Devices,,211

The present study examines the attitude of Indian citizens towards the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Social media posts were used for this research. Using Python, we have collected social media posts of Indians focusing on side effects of COVID -19 vaccines. In study one, sentimental analysis was done to find overall attitude of Indian citizens towards the side effects of COVID-19 vaccine and in study two, topic modeling done to analyze the major side effects voiced out by the citizens after taking COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: The studies conducted have revealed that nearly 78.5% of tweets posted by Indian citizens about the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine were either in neutral or positive sentiments. Our topic modeling studies have found that fear of efficiency in the workplace and the fear of death as the prime two issues that contributes Indian citizens to have negative sentiment about the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: While it is important for the Indian government to actively encourage its citizens to have vaccine, it is also important to help the citizens understand the important of the vaccination program. The best way to educate citizens regarding the positive aspect of the vaccination program is by addressing the fears, Indian citizens have voiced in their social media post about the COVID-19 vaccines.","Sv, Praveen; Tandon, Jyoti; Hinduja, Hitesh",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,211
468700,Cochrane Corner: Coronavirus (COVID-19): implementation facilitators to supporting programmes for improving the resilience and mental health of frontline workers during and after an epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only reservoirs of wild poliovirus transmission. Prior modeling suggested that before the COVID-19 pandemic, plans to stop the transmission of serotype 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) did not appear on track to succeed. METHODS: We updated an existing poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model for Pakistan and Afghanistan to characterize the impacts of immunization disruptions and restrictions on human interactions (i.e., population mixing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also consider different options for responding to outbreaks and for preventive supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). RESULTS: The modeling suggests that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, Pakistan and Afghanistan would remain off-track for stopping all transmission through 2023 without improvements in quality. CONCLUSIONS: Using trivalent OPV (tOPV) for SIAs instead of serotype 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2) offers substantial benefits for ending the transmission of both WPV1 and cVDPV2, because tOPV increases population immunity for both serotypes 1 and 2 while requiring fewer SIA rounds, when effectively delivered in transmission areas.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Pallansch, Mark A; Cochi, Stephen L; Thompson, Kimberly M",J. infect. dis,,211

471219,An efficient way to assess the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in the general population,2021,"PURPOSE: After the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 (COVID-19), physicians who inject OnabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) were left with determining risks and benefits in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy. Many of these patients have pre-existing conditions that make them more prone to COVID-19 symptoms, and this susceptibility potentially increases after BoNT-A injections. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 500 patients identified 256 pediatric patients with cerebral palsy who received an intramuscular BoNT-A injection to determine relative doses used for each Gross Motor Functional Classification Score (GMFCS). Data regarding age, weight, GMFCS, BoNT-A total body dosage, and inpatient hospitalizations for 6 months post-injection were collected. Differences between GMFCS levels were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance testing. Inpatient hospitalizations were recorded and assessed using relative risk to determine the population risk of hospitalization in the setting of initiating injections during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Based on GMFCS level, patients who were GMFCS I or II received fewer units of BoNT-A medication per kilogram of body weight compared to GMFCS III-V (p< 0.0005, F= 25.38). There was no statistically significant difference in frequency or time to hospitalization when comparing patients receiving BoNT-A compared to a control group. CONCLUSIONS: Resumption of BoNT-A injections during the time of COVID-19 requires a systematic approach based on risks and potential benefits. Data from this analysis does not show increased risk for patients who received injections historically; however, recommendations for resumption of injections has not previously been proposed in the setting of a pandemic. In this manuscript, a tiered approach to considerations for injections was proposed. Botulinum toxin type A injections have a history of improving spasticity in the pediatric patient with cerebral palsy. Ensuring appropriate selection of patients for injection with BoNT-A during this pandemic is increasingly important.","McLaughlin, Matthew J; Fisher, Mark T; Vadivelu, Sathya; Ramsey, Justin; Ratnasingam, Denesh; McGhee, Emily; Hartman, Kim",J Pediatr Rehabil Med,,211
472433,Combating COVID-related mental health problems: The experience from Wuhan,2020,"Treatment options for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited with no clarity on efficacy and safety profiles. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on patients &#8805;18 years reporting data on therapeutic interventions in SARS-CoV-2. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes were rates of mechanical ventilation, viral clearance, adverse events, discharge, and progression to severe disease. Pooled rates and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Twenty-nine studies with 5207 patients were included. Pooled all-cause mortality in intervention arm was 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1%-17.4%). Mortality was significantly higher for studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for intervention (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.97-1.89). Adverse events were also higher in HCQ subgroup (OR: 3.88; 95% CI: 1.60-9.45). There was no difference in other secondary outcomes. There is a need for well-designed randomized clinical trials for further investigation of every therapeutic intervention for further insight into different therapeutic options.","Thoguluva Chandrasekar, Viveksandeep; Venkatesalu, Bhanuprasad; Patel, Harsh K; Spadaccini, Marco; Manteuffel, Jacob; Ramesh, Mayur",J. med. virol,,211

473433,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: early quarantine-related anxiety and its correlates among Jordanians,2020,"Targeted wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proposed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Wastewater Surveillance System as a complementary approach to clinical surveillance to detect the presence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) at high-density facilities and institutions such as university campuses, nursing homes, and correctional facilities. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of targeted wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA together with individual-level testing for outbreak mitigation on a university campus during Fall 2020 semester. Wastewater samples (nâ¯=â¯117) were collected weekly from manholes or sewer cleanouts that receive wastewater inputs from dormitories, community-use buildings, and a COVID-19 isolation dormitory. Quantitative RT-PCR N1 and N2 assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid genes in wastewater. Due to varying human waste input in different buildings, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) RNA was also measured in all samples and used to normalize SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 RNA wastewater concentrations. In this study, temporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples mirrored trends in COVID-19 cases detected on campus. Normalizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations using human fecal indicator, PMMV enhanced the correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with COVID-19 cases. N1 and N2 genes were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases in dormitories, and the N2 gene was significantly correlated with the number of detected COVID-19 cases in dormitories. By implementing several public health surveillance programs include targeted wastewater surveillance, individual-level testing, contact tracing, and quarantine/isolation facilities, university health administrators could act decisively during an outbreak on campus, resulting in rapid decline of newly detected COVID-19 cases. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is a proactive outbreak monitoring tool for university campuses seeking to continue higher education practices in person during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Scott, Laura C; Aubee, Alexandra; Babahaji, Layla; Vigil, Katie; Tims, Scott; Aw, Tiong Gim",Environ Res,,211
473869,Optimism in times of despair- a perspective from a forensic mental health rehabilitation unit,2020,"In December 2019, a novel laboratory-confirmed coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which has caused clusters of severe illnesses, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China. This foodborne illness, which reportedly most likely originated in a seafood market where wild animals are sold illegally, has transmitted among humans through close contact, across the world. The aim of this study is to explore health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward healthy/risky food in the immediate context of food crisis. More specifically, by using the data collected from 1008 respondents in January 2020, the time when China was hit hard by the ""Corona Virus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19), this study investigates the overall and different generational respondents' health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat. The results reveal that, firstly, based on their food health and risk perceptions of healthy and risky food, the respondents' general attitudes are positive toward organic food but relatively negative toward game meat. Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations' attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values. In addition, this research also indicates that the COVID-19 crisis influences the respondents' perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat consumption. However, the likelihood of its impact on older generations' future change in diets is smaller, which implies that older generations' food beliefs are more stable.","Xie, Xiaoru; Huang, Liman; Li, Jun Justin; Zhu, Hong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,211

Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, the best-studied inflammasome, has contrasting roles in cancer development and progressions. In head-and-neck cancers, the upregulated level of NLRP3 promotes tumor progression. The main objective of this review is to provide current knowledge on the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in head-and-neck cancers. Deeper understanding of the biology of this dynamic protein complex provides new scope for the development of more effective anticancer therapies.","Sheeja, K; Lakshmi, S",J Cancer Res Ther,,211

We conducted a study to evaluate two academic laboratories' fingerstick capillary blood collection kits suitable for home use for laboratory measurement of HbA1c. Methods: Four clinical sites recruited 240 participants (aged 4-80 years, HbA1c 5.1%-13.5%). Capillary blood samples were obtained by the participant or parent using collection kits from two laboratories (University of Minnesota Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL) and Children's Mercy Hospital Laboratory (CMH)) and mailed under varying shipping conditions by United States Postal Service to the laboratories. Comparisons were made between HbA1c measurements from capillary samples and contemporaneously obtained venous samples. The primary outcome was percentage of capillary HbA1c values within 5% of the corresponding venous values. Results: HbA1c values were within 5% of venous values for 96% of ARDL kit specimens shipped with a cold pack and 98% without a cold pack and 99% and 99%, respectively, for the CMH kits. R2 values were 0.98, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. Results appeared similar across HbA1c levels and for pediatric and adult participants. Usability survey scores were high. Conclusions: Capillary blood collection kits, suitable for home use, from two academic laboratories, were demonstrated to be easy to use and provided results that are comparable with those obtained from venous specimens. Based on these results, there is strong evidence that HbA1c measurements from capillary specimens obtained with these specific kits can be used interchangeably with HbA1c measurements from venous specimens for clinical research and clinical care.","Beck, Roy W; Bocchino, Laura E; Lum, John W; Kollman, Craig; Barnes-Lomen, Victoria; Sulik, Mark; Haller, Michael J; Bode, Bruce; Cernich, Joseph T; Killeen, Anthony A; Garg, Uttam; Liljenquist, David; Adams, Janey G; Clements, Margaret; Gabrielson, Deanna; Johnson, Terri; Clements, Mark A",Diabetes technol. ther,,211

Participants were recruited through purposeful sampling. Interview transcripts underwent thematic analysis using Dedoose software. RESULTS: Seven ENT trainees were interviewed, ranging from specialty trainee years four to eight ('ST4' to 'ST8') in grade. Six core themes were identified: organisation of redeployment, utilisation of skill set, emotional impact of redeployment, redeployed team dynamics, concerns about safety and impact on training. CONCLUSION: The ENT trainees' experiences of redeployment described highlight some important lessons and considerations for future redeployments.","Lion, P; McClenaghan, F; Hall, A; Mackinnon, S; Navaratnam, A V",J Laryngol Otol,,211

As pressure mounted to scale back measures, understanding public priorities was critical. We assessed initial public adherence with and support for stay-at-home orders in nations and cities with different SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 death rates. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were administered to representative samples of adults aged &#8805;18 years from regions with different SARS-CoV-2 prevalences from April 2-8, 2020. Regions included two nations [the United States (US-high prevalence) and Australia (AU-low prevalence)] and two US cities [New York City (NY-high prevalence) and Los Angeles (LA-low prevalence)]. Regional SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 prevalence (cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19 deaths) as of April 8, 2020: US (363,321, 10,845), AU (5956, 45), NY (81,803, 4571), LA (7530, 198). Of 8718 eligible potential respondents, 5573 (response rate, 63.9%) completed surveys. Median age was 47 years (range, 18-89); 3039 (54.5%) were female. RESULTS: Of 5573 total respondents, 4560 (81.8%) reported adherence with recommended quarantine or stay-at-home policies (range of samples, 75.5-88.2%). Additionally, 29.1% of respondents screened positive for anxiety or depression symptoms (range of samples, 28.6-32.0%), with higher prevalences among those of younger age, female gender, and those in quarantine or staying at home most of the time versus those who did not report these behaviours. Despite elevated prevalences of adverse mental health symptoms and significant life disruptions, 5022 respondents (90.1%) supported government-imposed stay-at-home orders (range of samples, 88.9-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believed orders should last at least three more weeks or until public health or government officials recommended, with support spanning the political spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: Public adherence with COVID-19 mitigation policies was highly prevalent, in both highly-affected (US, NY) and minimally-affected regions (AU, LA). Despite disruption of respondents' lives, the vast majority supported continuation of extended stay-at-home orders. Despite common support, these two countries diverged in stringent mitigation implementation, which may have contributed to subsequent outcomes.

METHODS: 25 inpatients with AN were tested roughly weekly for up to 16 weeks. Muscle power was assessed by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Intra-class coefficients (ICCs) indicated high Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) for the HGS (10 participants). Cohen's Kappa showed moderate IRR for the SUSS test (25 participants). Stepwise multiple regression showed that the SUSS tests plus HGS predicted BMI and BMI risk level explaining about two-third of the variance. Each test individually had lower predictive value. There was a little difference between the two versions of the SUSS tested. CONCLUSIONS: HGS and SUSS are valid and reliable measurements of muscle power in AN. Together, the SUSS tests and the HGS represent a useful and effective measure of muscle power and hence one aspect of physical risk in Anorexia Nervosa. In the light of Covid restrictions, the SUSS test is one way that physical state can be monitored on video link in a way that is hard to falsify.","Etemadi, Sara; Sun, Grey Xiaoliai; Leung, Sum-Ping; Siddique, Arshad; Cooper, Steven; Ezenwa, Nwabunma Christiana; Treasure, Janet; Robinson, Paul",Eur Eat Disord Rev,,211

We investigated the genetic diversity and evolution of this virus during the early outbreak months between 14th February to 24th April 2020, using whole genome sequences. METHODS: We performed recombination analysis against closely related CoV, Bayesian time scaled phylogeny and investigated spike protein amino acid mutations. RESULTS: recombination signals were observed between the AfrSARSCoV-2 sequences and reference sequences within the RdRPs and S genes. The evolutionary rate of the AfrSARSCoV-2 was 4.133 × 10-4 Highest Posterior Density (HPD 4.132 × 10-4 to 4.134 × 10-4) substitutions/site/year. The time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the African strains was December 7th 2019, (95% HPD November 12th 2019-December 29th 2019). The AfrSARCoV-2 sequences diversified into two lineages A and B with B being more diverse with multiple sub-lineages confirmed by both maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and PANGOLIN software. There was a high prevalence of the D614-G spike protein amino acid mutation 59/69(82.61%) among the African strains.

486598,Debate: COVID-19 and children in India,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, has one of the largest burns, hands and plastics department in the UK, totalling 83 doctors. Our response to the COVID-19 response was uniquely far reaching, with our department being given responsibility of an entire 36 bed medical COVID-19 ward in addition to our commitment to specialty-specific work, and saw half of our work force re-deployed to Intensive Treatment Unit (ITU). Our aim was to exploit the high calibre of doctors found in plastic surgery, and to demonstrate, we were able to support the COVID-19 effort beyond our normal scope of practice. In order to achieve this aim, the department underwent significant structural and leadership changes. Factors considered included: rota and shift pattern changes to implement depth and resilience to sudden fluctuations in staffing levels; a preparatory phase for focussed upskilling and relevant training packages to be delivered; managing the COVID-19 ward cover and ITU deployment; adjustments to our front of house and elective specialty-specific service, including developing alternative and streamlined patient pathways; mitigating the effects on plastic surgical training during the pandemic; the importance of communications for patient care and physician wellbeing; and leadership techniques and styles we considered important. By sharing our experience during this pandemic, we hope to reflect on and share lessons learned, as well as to demonstrate that it is possible to rapidly mobilise and retrain plastic surgeons at all levels to contribute safely and productively beyond a specialty-specific scope of care.","Leng, C; Challoner, T; Hausien, O; Filobbos, G; Baden, J",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,211

487845,Mental health considerations for children quarantined because of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Evaluating whether an infectious disease has reached a turning point is important for planning additional intervention efforts. This study aimed to analyze the changing patterns and the tempogeographic features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China, to provide further evidence for real-time responses. METHODS: Daily data on COVID-19 cases between 31 December 2019 and 26 February 2020 were collected and analyzed for Hubei and non-Hubei regions in China. Observed trends for new and cumulative cases were analyzed through joinpoint regression analysis. Spatial analysis was applied to show the geographic distribution and changing patterns of the epidemic. RESULTS: By 26 February 2020, 78â 630 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in China. In Hubei, an increasing trend (slopeâ =â 221) was observed for new cases between 24 January and 7 February 2020, after which a decline commenced (slopeâ =â -868). However, as the diagnosis criteria changed, a sudden increase (slopeâ =â 5530) was observed on 12 February, which sharply decreased afterward (slopeâ =â -4898). In non-Hubei regions, the number of new cases increased from 20 January to 3 February and started to decline afterward (slopeâ =â -53). The spatial analysis identified Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Changsha, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Shanghai, Xinyang, Jining, and Beijing as the hotspots outside of Hubei Province in China. CONCLUSIONS: The joinpoint regression analysis indicated that the epidemic might be under control in China, especially for regions outside of Hubei Province. Further improvement in the response strategies based on these new patterns is needed.","Tang, Weiming; Liao, Huipeng; Marley, Gifty; Wang, Zaisheng; Cheng, Weibin; Wu, Dan; Yu, Rongbinand",Clin Infect Dis,,211

Novel solutions are needed to enhance substance use treatment during a time when many patients are disconnected from clinical care and social support. Digital phenotyping, which leverages the unique functionality of smartphone sensors (GPS, social behavior, and typing patterns), can buttress clinical treatment in a remote, scalable fashion. Specifically, digital phenotyping has the potential to improve relapse prediction and intervention, relapse detection, and overdose intervention. Digital phenotyping may enhance relapse prediction through coupling machine learning algorithms with the enormous amount of collected behavioral data. Activity-based analysis in real time can potentially be used to prevent relapse by warning substance users when they approach locational triggers such as bars or liquor stores. Wearable devices detect when a person has relapsed to substances through measuring physiological changes such as electrodermal activity and locomotion. Despite the initial promise of this approach, privacy, security, and barriers to access are important issues to address.","Hsu, Michael; Ahern, David K; Suzuki, Joji",JMIR Ment Health,,211
497120,"Pandemic emotions: the extent, correlates, and mental health consequences of fear of COVID-19",2021,"Overview: US growth upgrade boosts global outlook ▀ We have raised our global economic forecasts again this month and maintain a relatively upbeat outlook about the pace of the economic recovery. We now expect world GDP to grow 6.3% this year and 4.6% in 2022, 0.2pp and 0.4pp higher than we were projecting a month ago. ▀ While recent Covid-related developments confirm that the pandemic is far from over, the economic data have continued to paint a positive picture. Not only has the hard economic data exceeded consensus expectations, but the April rise in the global services PMI to its highest level since 2007 suggests the recovery is broadening away from industry. ▀ We have made some downward revisions to the near-term outlook for some key current Covid hotspots such as India and Brazil. However, these downward revisions have been more than offset by increased optimism about mid-year growth prospects in the rest of the world. ▀ A key driver of the upward revision to our 2022 global GDP forecast and beyond is the inclusion of the $2.7trn American Jobs plan in our baseline forecast. This had led to an upgrade to our US growth forecast to 7.7% this year and 4.5% in 2022. ▀ The latest changes in forecasts mean that booming world growth in 2021 will be followed by another year of strong underlying growth by post-global financial crisis standards as economies regain ground lost during the pandemic. And there are upside risks to the 2022 from a larger unwind of households' excess savings in the advanced economies. ▀ We have also raised our world CPI inflation forecast slightly in response to the more upbeat growth assessment. Although the risk of overheating varies among economies, we still expect structural factors to ensure that the inevitable near-term rise in inflation does not morph into a sustained period of strong inflation.","Anonymous,",Economic Outlook,,211

503295,Interest and readiness for digital mental health in coordinate specialty care for early course psychosis: A survey study of 42 programs in 30 states,2020,"BACKGROUND: Physicians, including psychiatrists and general practitioners (GPs), have been reported as essential sources of stigma towards people diagnosed with a mental disorder (PDMDs), which constitutes an important barrier to recovery and is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Therefore, psychiatrists and GPs are key populations where it is crucial to examine stigma, improve attitudes and reduce discrimination towards psychiatric patients. AIMS: This study is the first to explore mental health-related stigma among Portuguese psychiatrists and GPs, examining the differences between these two specialities and assessing whether sociodemographic and professional variables are associated with stigma. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed between June 2018 and August 2019. A consecutive sample of 55 Psychiatrists and 67 GPs working in Porto (Portugal) filled a 25-item self-report questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards PDMDs in clinical practice. The instrument was designed by the authors, based on previous mental health-related stigma studies and validated scales. The questionnaire includes 12 stigma dimensions (Autonomy, Coercion, Incompetence, Dangerousness, Permanence, Pity, Responsibility, Segregation, Labelling, Diagnostic Overshadowing, Shame and Parental Incompetence), and its total score was used to measure Overall Stigma (OS). Sample characteristics were examined using descriptive statistics, and the factors affecting stigma were assessed through regression analysis. RESULTS: GPs exhibit significantly higher OS levels than psychiatrists, and present higher scores in the dimensions of dangerousness, parental incompetence, diagnostic overshadowing and responsibility. Besides medical speciality, several other sociodemographic variables were associated with sigma, including age, gender, having a friend with a mental disorder, professional category, agreement that Psychiatry diverges from core medicine and physician's interest in mental health topics. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that both psychiatrists and GPs hold some degree of stigmatizing attitudes towards PDMDs. Overall, these results bring new light to stigma research, and provide information to tailor anti-stigma interventions to Portuguese psychiatrists and GPs.","Almeida, Bárbara; Samouco, Ana; Grilo, Filipe; Pimenta, Sónia; Moreira, Ana Maria",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,211

This technology offers an extremely good energy resolution, comparable to semiconductor detectors, and a wide choice of target materials, making low temperature calorimetric detectors ideal for a variety of particle physics applications. Rare event searches have continued to require ever greater exposures, which has driven them to ever larger cryogenic detectors, with the CUORE experiment being the first to reach a tonne-scale, mK-cooled, experimental mass. CUORE, designed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay, has been operational since 2017 at a temperature of about 10 mK. This result has been attained by the use of an unprecedentedly large cryogenic infrastructure called the CUORE cryostat: conceived, designed and commissioned for this purpose. In this article the main characteristics and features of the cryogenic facility developed for the CUORE experiment are highlighted. A brief introduction of the evolution of the field and of the past cryogenic facilities are given. The motivation behind the design and development of the CUORE cryogenic facility is detailed as are the steps taken toward realization, commissioning, and operation of the CUORE cryostat. The major challenges overcome by the collaboration and the solutions implemented throughout the building of the cryogenic facility will be discussed along with the potential improvements for future facilities. The success of CUORE has opened the door to a new generation of large-scale cryogenic facilities in numerous fields of science.

504844,KSADS-COMP Perspectives on Child Psychiatric Diagnostic Assessment and Treatment Planning,2020,"Background: A large number of people contracted moderate-type COVID-19 around the world. However, to our knowledge no studies have covered the clinical course of patients with moderate-type COVID-19. This study describes the clinical course of moderate-type patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan City and Yiyang City, and explores factors relevant to the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Methods: The study analyzed the clinical course of 107 moderate-type patients with COVID-19 from the outbreak area (Wuhan) and the imported area (Yiyang), and used automatic linear modeling and multivariate linear regression analysis to explore the factors relevant to the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Furthermore, we created a scoring system to value the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief. Results: Lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, increased LDH, bilateral lung GGO (ground glass opacity), and lung consolidation were more likely to appear in ordinary inpatients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Wuhan (P < 0.05), compared to infected medical staff from Wuhan and ordinary inpatients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Yiyang. Meanwhile, the length of hospitalization and symptoms relief was longer in ordinary patients with moderate-type COVID-19 from Wuhan (P < 0.05). Onset of symptoms to admission, ESR, leucocytes count, and bilateral lung GGO were linearly related to the length of hospitalization (P < 0.05); onset of symptoms to admission, leucocytes count, bilateral lung GGO, and lung consolidation were linearly related to the length of symptoms relief (P < 0.05). By using the scoring system, we found that the time of hospitalization and symptoms relief lengthened as the scores increased. Conclusions: This study described the clinical course of patients with moderate-type COVID-19, and found that ordinary patients with moderate-type COVID-19 in outbreak areas were more serious and needed stronger treatment and longer treatment time. Onset of symptoms to admission, ESR, leucocytes count, and bilateral lung GGO can be effective predictors of the length of hospitalization. And onset of symptoms to admission, leucocytes count, bilateral lung GGO, and lung consolidation can be effective predictors of the amount of time until symptoms relief. Most importantly, we have created a scoring system, which could contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Liao, Xiaohua; Lv, Xin; Song, Cheng; Jiang, Mao; He, Ronglin; Han, Yuanyuan; Li, Mengyu; Zhang, Yan; Jiang, Yupeng; Meng, Jie",Front Public Health,,211

Asthma is one such condition, which may be exacerbated by both prolonged adverse in-home exposures if quarantining in unhealthy homes and prolonged outdoor exposures if the ambient air quality is unhealthy or hazardous. As both are often the case in Environmental Justice (EJ) communities, here we have analyzed data at the census tract (CT) level for Louisiana to assess any correlation between social and environmental vulnerability, and health issues like COVID-19 and asthma. Higher Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Particulate Matter less than 2.5 {micro}m in diameter (PM2.5) and Ozone levels were associated with higher rates of cumulative COVID-19 incidence at various time points during the pandemic, as well as higher average annual asthma hospitalization rates and estimated asthma prevalence. Further, cumulative COVID-19 incidence during the first three months of the pandemic was moderately correlated with both asthma hospitalizations and estimated prevalence, suggesting similar underlying factors may be affecting both conditions. Additionally, 137 CTs were identified where social and environmental vulnerabilities co-existed, of which 75 (55%) had high estimated prevalence of asthma. These areas are likely to benefit from asthma outreach that considers both social and environmental risk factors. Fifteen out of the 137 CTs (11%) not only had higher estimated prevalence of asthma but also a high burden of COVID-19. Further research in these areas may help to elucidate any common social determinants of health that underlie both asthma and COVID-19 burdens, as well as better clarify the possible role of the environment as related to the COVID-19 burden in Louisiana.","Bakshi, Arundhati; Doren, Alicia Van; Maser, Colette; Aubin, Kathleen; Stewart, Collette; Soileau, Shannon; Friedman, Kate; Williams, Alexis",,,211

Although 84% of patients reported receiving Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, more asymptomatic patients had BCG than symptomatic (p = 0.017). Almost all patients (97.5%) had an elevated D-dimer level. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein were elevated in 50% and 42.7% of patients, respectively. High ESR found to be the predictor of abnormal chest radiograph observed in 13 (16%) patients with OR of 14.26 (95% CI 1.37–147.97, p = 0.026). Conclusions: An outbreak of COVID-19 infection in northern Jordan affected more females and relatively young individuals and caused mainly mild illnesses. The strict outbreak response measures applied at early stages probably contributed to the lenient nature of this outbreak, but the contribution of other factors to such variability in COVID-19 presentation is yet to be explained.","Samrah, Shaher M.; W Al-Mistarehi, Abdel-Hameed; Ibnian, Ali M.; Raffee, Liqaa A.; Momany, Suleiman M.; Al-Ali, Musa; Hayajneh, Wail A.; Yusef, Dawood H.; Awad, Samah M.; Khassawneh, Basheer Y.",Ann.

While e-pharmacy businesses were initially the preserve of high-income countries, in the past decade they have been growing rapidly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Public health concerns associated with e-pharmacy include the sale of prescription-only medicines without a prescription and the sale of substandard and falsified medicines. There are also non-health-related risks such as consumer fraud and lack of data privacy. However, e-pharmacy may also have the potential to improve access to medicines. Drawing on existing literature and a set of key informant interviews in Kenya, Nigeria and India, we examine the e-pharmacy regulatory systems in LMICs. None of the study countries had yet enacted a regulatory framework specific to e-pharmacy. Key regulatory challenges included the lack of consensus on regulatory models, lack of regulatory capacity, regulating sales across borders and risks of over-regulation. However, e-pharmacy also presents opportunities to enhance medicine regulation-through consolidation in the sector, and the traceability and transparency that online records offer. The regulatory process needs to be adapted to keep pace with this dynamic landscape and exploit these possibilities. This will require exploration of a range of innovative regulatory options, collaboration with larger, more compliant businesses, and engagement with global regulatory bodies. A key first step must be ensuring that national regulators are equipped with the necessary awareness and technical expertise to actively oversee this e-pharmacy activity.","Miller, Rosalind; Wafula, Francis; Onoka, Chima A; Saligram, Prasanna; Musiega, Anita; Ogira, Dosila; Okpani, Ikedichi; Ejughemre, Ufuoma; Murthy, Shrutika; Garimella, Surekha; Sanderson, Marie; Ettelt, Stefanie; Allen, Pauline; Nambiar, Devaki; Salam, Abdul; Kweyu, Emmanuel; Hanson, Kara; Goodman, Catherine",,,211

In the face of the global pandemic, access to traditional training techniques is limited. As health and safety have become top priorities, surgical residents have been reassigned to COVID units and most elective surgeries have been either postponed or canceled. The current global pandemic provides an opportunity to re-examine surgical education. As many technical skills training programs are temporarily put on hold, residents, as well as medical students, are concerned about their ability to acquire the necessary skillsets to allow them to provide excellent care to their patients. Simulators can be used to help trainees become familiar with specific surgical procedures, analyze 3D anatomical structures, and practice technical skills in risk-free environments. Intelligent tutoring systems are automated teaching platforms capable of providing individualized performance feedback to learners using a variety of simulators. The authors are not advocating for the replacement of the present educational paradigms by automated systems. They recognize that human interaction is vital to learning.

517392,Structural Inequities and the Impact of COVID-19 on Latinx Children: Implications for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Practice,2021,"Introduction: At the beginning of 2020, the worldwide infection of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) changed many aspects of human lives. The controlled lockdown was not only an obligatory lifestyle change to communities across the globe, but it was also an emotional struggle. The aim of the presented study was to identify and compare the main difficulties that final-year students (both Polish and foreigners) of Dentistry, Faculty of Medical Sciences in Zabrze Medical University of Silesia had to cope with during the first wave of the pandemic. Application of the biographical method in the form of essays written was done. Authors discussed the following issues: possible losses and benefits subjectively felt by individuals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adaptation to online type of studying, students’ opinions regarding change of habits, and psychological impact of the lockdown. Students’ responses varied between groups in the aspect of what they considered as the biggest struggle of the pandemic time period. Adaptation to e-learning was easier for the group of foreign students. The Polish group considered it as a serious stress factor. Foreigners were much more worried about not being able to help their families in comparison to Polish students. Polish students’ fear was related to the fear of virus transmission to their older relatives. Both groups were aware of how serious the situation was and of the possible impact of lack of practical classes on their future internships. As benefits of that situation, both groups listed development of new hobbies and increased sport activities. The Polish group emphasized improvement of interpersonal bonds during the lockdown in their families. The main conclusion proved an awareness of the seriousness of the situation in which students of medical, especially dental faculties found themselves. Concerns were related to the form of further studies and the possibility of taking up employment after graduation. Polish students declared more intense concerns about e-learning and remote study than foreign-language students who were more familiar with this form of communication. A particularly valuable form of teaching for students may be increased numbers of online consultations, since even though they cannot replace practical classes, they may still be helpful in explaining doubts and simply “being there”. Encouraging young people to discover constructive benefits of the pandemic can also be one of a task-oriented strategies of help.","Trzcionka, Agata Zalewska Irena Tanasiewicz Marta",Healthcare,,211

Pb adverse effects on nitric oxide (NO-) production and variable effects on inflammatory cytokines in activated macrophages have been reported, but no effects have been reported in anti-inflammatory macrophages. We studied Pb (0.03-6 µg/dL equivalent to 0.014-2.89 µM) effects on the function of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) induced to either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes, with LPS + IFNÎ³ or IL-4+IL-13, respectively, and whether these effects are related. Pb did not induce cytotoxicity at any concentration in both macrophage phenotypes. In inflammatory BMDM, Pb (6 µg/dL) inhibited NO- production without affecting inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels or basal arginase activity. At 3 and 6 µg/dL, Pb enhanced the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) membrane expression but did not modify CD86 expression, TNF&#945;, or IL-1ß production and secretion. In anti-inflammatory BMDM, Pb did not alter arginase activity, but at 3 and 6 µg/dL, increased TGF-ß1 and mannose receptor expression. Results showed that environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb alter functional outcomes or phenotypic markers of anti-inflammatory for the first time. The Pb effects on the inflammatory macrophages are not dependent on negative feedback resulting from the Pb effect on the anti-inflammatory phenotype. The Pb affected only some molecules or specific pathways related to both phenotypes. These effects could be related to Pb effects on immune defense against intracellular pathogens and allergy susceptibility.","Ortiz-Robles, Christian D; Cortés-Montoya, Vanessa; Reyes-Aguilar, Sandra S; Albores, Arnulfo; Calderón-Aranda, Emma S",Toxicology,,211

523082,Positive Correlation Between General Public Knowledge and Attitudes Regarding COVID-19 Outbreak 1 Month After First Cases Reported in Indonesia,2020,"Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), present in 1-5 % of healthy individuals, are associated with the risk of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is the most common form of acquired thrombophilia. APLs may appear following infections or vaccinations and have been reported in patients with COronaVIrus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, their association with COVID-19 vaccination is unclear. Notably, a few cases of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events resembling APS have been reported to develop in recipients of either adenoviral vector- or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of this review is therefore to speculate on the plausible role of aPLs in the pathogenesis of these rare adverse events. Adenoviral vector-based vaccines can bind platelets and induce their destruction in the reticuloendothelial organs. Liposomal mRNA-based vaccines may instead favour activation of coagulation factors and confer a pro-thrombotic phenotype to endothelial cells and platelets. Furthermore, both formulations may trigger a type I interferon response associated with the generation of aPLs. In turn, aPLs may lead to aberrant activation of the immune response with participation of innate immune cells, cytokines and the complement cascade. NETosis, monocyte recruitment and cytokine release may further support endothelial dysfunction and promote platelet aggregation. These considerations suggest that aPLs may represent a risk factor for thrombotic events following COVID-19 vaccination, and deserve further investigations.","Talotta, Rossella; Robertson, Erle S",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,211

The authors hypothesized that more patients at academic sites than at community‐based sites would be willing to consider these procedures. METHODS: In total, 198 patients with early stage breast cancer were recruited from 3 academic centers (n = 102) and from 1 community oncology practice (n = 96). The primary objective was to compare the proportion of patients willing to consider donating excess tissue biospecimens from surgery, from a clinically indicated breast biopsy, or from a research purposes‐only biopsy (RPOB) between practice types. RESULTS: Most patients (93% at academic sites, 94% at the community oncology site) said they would consider donating excess tissue from surgery for research. One‐half of patients from academic or community sites would consider donating tissue from a clinically indicated breast biopsy. On univariate analysis, significantly fewer patients from academic sites would consider an RPOB (22% at academic sites, 42% at the community site; P = .003); however, this difference was no longer significant on multivariate analysis (P = .96). Longer transportation times and unfavorable prior experiences were associated with less willingness to consider an RPOB on multivariate analysis. Significantly fewer patients from academic sites (14%) than from the community site (35%) would consider a research biopsy in a clinical trial (P = .04). Contributing to scientific knowledge, return of results, and a personal request by their physician were the strongest factors influencing patients' willingness to undergo research biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: The current results rejected the hypothesis that more patients with early breast cancer at academic sites would be willing to donate tissue biospecimens for research compared with those at community oncology sites. These findings identify modifiable factors to consider in biobanking studies and clinical trials.","Seah, Davinia S.; Leone, Jose Pablo; Openshaw, Thomas H.; Scott, Sarah M.; Tayob, Nabihah; Hu, Jiani; Lederman, Ruth I.; Frank, Elizabeth S.; Sohl, Jessica J.; Stadler, Zsofia K.; Erick, Timothy K.; Silverman, Stuart G.; Peppercorn, Jeffrey M.; Winer, Eric P.; Come, Steven E.; Lin, Nancy U.",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320362/,211

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in plasma, bronchoalveolar aspirate (BAS) and CSF in two critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Remdesivir was administered at 200 mg loading dose on the first day followed by 12 days of 100 mg in two critically ill patients. Blood samples were collected immediately after (C(0)) and at 1 (C(1)) and 24 h (C(24)) after intravenous administration on day 3 until day 9. BAS samples were collected on Days 4, 7 and 9 from both patients while one CSF on Day 7 was obtained in one patient. Remdesivir and GS-441524 concentrations were measured in these samples using a validated UHPLC-MS/MS method. RESULTS: We observed higher concentrations of remdesivir at C(0) (6- to 7-fold higher than EC(50) from in vitro studies) and a notable decay at C(1). GS-441524 plasma concentrations reached a peak at C(1) and persisted until the next administration. Higher concentrations of GS-441524 were observed in the patient with mild renal dysfunction.

Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic. None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on people’s movements. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse. Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel society’s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories. The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war. In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on people’s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on. Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies. I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month. The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015). The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others. The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19.","Herat, Manel",Social sciences & humanities open,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291120300310?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173488/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590291120300310,211

Implications for Practice The findings in the pathogenesis panel have several implications for both research and clinical practice. The most urgent areas appear to be to continue monitoring the emergence of novel otopathogens, and the need to develop prevention and preventative therapies that do not rely on antibiotics and protect against the development of the initial OM episode.","Thornton, R.

596975,THE ROLE OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS WHEN DISASTER STRIKES: A TRAINING COURSE IN THE AGE OF COVID-19,2020-10-31,"Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is a serious complication after lung transplantation and thought to represent chronic rejection. Increased expression of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an acute phase protein, was associated with worse outcome in lung transplant patients. To determine the role of recipient PTX3 in development of chronic rejection, we used a minor alloantigen-mismatched murine orthotopic single lung transplant model. Male C57BL/10 mice were used as donors. Male PTX3 knockout (KO) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates on 129/SvEv/C57BL6/J background were used as recipients. In KO recipients, 7/13 grafted lungs were consolidated without volume recovery on CT scan, while only 2/9 WT mice showed similar graft consolidation. For grafts where lung volume could be reliably analyzed by CT scan, the lung volume recovery was significantly reduced in KO mice compared to WT. Interstitial inflammation, parenchymal fibrosis and bronchiolitis obliterans scores were significantly higher in KO mice. Presence of myofibroblasts and lymphoid aggregation was significantly enhanced in the grafts of PTX3 KO recipients. Recipient PTX3 deficiency enhanced chronic rejection-like lesions by promoting a fibrotic process in the airways and lung parenchyma. The underlying mechanisms and potential protective role of exogenous PTX3 as a therapy should be further explored.","Yoshida, Mitsuteru; Oishi, Hisashi; Martinu, Tereza; Hwang, David M.; Takizawa, Hiromitsu; Sugihara, Junichi; McKee, Trevor D.; Bai, Xiaohui; Guana, Zehong; Lua, Christina; Cho, Hae-Ra; Juvet, Stephen; Cypel, Marcelo; Keshavjee, Shaf; Liu, Mingyao",Oncotarget,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29492210/; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.23902,211

Data are also lacking as to whether and how adaptive immune and inflammatory responses differ in individuals that experience persistent symptomatic sequelae months following acute infection compared to those with complete, rapid recovery. We measured SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, soluble markers of inflammation, and antibody levels and neutralization capacity longitudinally up to 9 months following infection in a diverse group of 70 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The participants had varying degrees of initial disease severity and were enrolled in the northern California Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort. Adaptive T cell responses remained remarkably stable in all participants across disease severity during the entire study interval. Whereas the magnitude of the early CD4+ T cell immune response is determined by the severity of initial infection (participants requiring hospitalization or intensive care), pre-existing lung disease was significantly associated with higher long-term SARS-CoV2-specific CD8+ T cell responses, independent of initial disease severity or age. Neutralizing antibody levels were strongly correlated with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T but not CD8+ T cell responses. Importantly, we did not identify substantial differences in long-term virus-specific T cell or antibody responses between participants with and without COVID-19-related symptoms that persist months after initial infection.","Peluso, Michael J.; Deitchman, Amelia N.; Torres, Leonel; Iyer, Nikita S.; Nixon, Christopher C.; Munter, Sadie E.; Donatelli, Joanna; Thanh, Cassandra; Takahashi, Saki; Hakim, Jill; Turcios, Keirstinne; Janson, Owen; Hoh, Rebecca; Tai, Viva; Hernandez, Yanel; Fehrman, Emily; Spinelli, Matthew A.; Gandhi, Monica; Trinh, Lan; Wrin, Terri; Petropoulos, Christos J.; Aweeka, Francesca T.; Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel; Kelly, J.

597969,Canada's universal health-care system: achieving its potential,2018-02-23,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has deeply altered social and working environments in several ways. Social distancing policies, mandatory lockdowns, isolation periods, and anxiety of getting sick, along with the suspension of productive activity, loss of income, and fear of the future, jointly influence the mental health of citizens and workers. Workplace aspects can play a crucial role on moderating or worsening mental health of people facing this pandemic scenario. The purpose of this literature review is to deepen the psychological aspects linked to workplace factors, following the epidemic rise of COVID-19, in order to address upcoming psychological critical issues in the workplaces. We performed a literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, selecting papers focusing on workers’ psychological problems that can be related to the workplace during the pandemic. Thirty-five articles were included. Mental issues related to the health emergency, such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disorders are more likely to affect healthcare workers, especially those on the frontline, migrant workers, and workers in contact with the public. Job insecurity, long periods of isolation, and uncertainty of the future worsen the psychological condition, especially in younger people and in those with a higher educational background. Multiple organizational and work-related interventions can mitigate this scenario, such as the improvement of workplace infrastructures, the adoption of correct and shared anti-contagion measures, including regular personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, and the implementation of resilience training programs. This review sets the basis for a better understanding of the psychological conditions of workers during the pandemic, integrating individual and social perspectives, and providing insight into possible individual, social, and occupational approaches to this “psychological pandemic”.","Giorgi, Gabriele; Lecca, Luigi Isaia; Alessio, Federico; Finstad, Georgia Libera; Bondanini, Giorgia; Lulli, Lucrezia Ginevra; Arcangeli, Giulio; Mucci, Nicola",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120930/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17217857,211

Research exploring low-grade systemic inflammation and its impact on the development and progression of neurodegenerative disease has increased. A particular research focus has been whether systemic inflammation arises only as a secondary effect of disease, or it is also a cause of pathology. The inflammasomes, and more specifically the NLRP3 inflammasome, are crucial components of the innate immune system and are usually activated in response to infection or tissue damage. Although inflammasome activation plays critical roles against various pathogens in host defense, overactivation of inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. This review summarizes the current literature on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of AD, and its involvement in infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2. NLRP3 might represent the crossroad between the hypothesized neurodegeneration and the primary COVID-19 infection.","Sita, Giulia; Graziosi, Agnese; Hrelia, Patrizia; Morroni, Fabiana",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22136984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209586/,211

The search for new or repurposed drugs for treatment of COVID-19 continues. We have witnessed anecdotal use of herbal medicines, including Artemisia spp. extracts, in low-income countries, and exaggerated claims of their efficacies that are not evidence based, with subsequent political controversy. These events highlight the urgent need for further research on herbal compounds to evaluate efficacy through RCTs, and, when efficacious compounds are identified, to establish the active ingredients, develop formulations and dosing, and define pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and safety to enable drug development.

Although, the disease appeared in Africa later than other regions, it has now spread to virtually all countries on the continent. We provide early spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 within the first 62 days of the disease's appearance on the African continent. We used a two-parameter hurdle Poisson model to simultaneously analyse the zero counts and the frequency of occurrence. We investigate the effects of important healthcare capacities including hospital beds and number of medical doctors in different countries. The results show that cases of the pandemic vary geographically across Africa with notably high incidence in neighbouring countries particularly in West and North Africa. The burden of the disease (per 100 000) mostly impacted Djibouti, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Temporally, during the first 4 weeks, the burden was highest in Senegal, Egypt and Mauritania, but by mid-April it shifted to Somalia, Chad, Guinea, Tanzania, Gabon, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Currently, Namibia, Angola, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda have the least burden. These findings could be useful in guiding epidemiological interventions and the allocation of scarce resources based on heterogeneity of the disease patterns.","Gayawan, Ezra; Awe, Olushina O.; Oseni, Bamidele M.; Uzochukwu, Ikemefuna C.; Adekunle, Adeshina; Samuel, Gbemisola; Eisen, Damon P.; Adegboye, Oyelola A.",Epidemiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820001983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873352/,211

Stem Cell transplantation is used for the treatment for a wide variety of diseases, including leukemia and lymphoma. PURPOSE: This study highlights prevention strategies of infectious diseases among HSCT donors and recipients in our institute as guided by International guidelines. We aim to highlight the strategy for extensive screening of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis cases in all the stem cell units stored in our facility METHODS: We searched the institutional database to identify cases of infectious diseases among HSC transplants. Extensive donor evaluation was conducted through screening and laboratory infectious disease testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis. RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2014, 263 consecutive adult HSCT were performed. An approximate equal number of autologous and allogeneic HSC collections were undertaken. The median age for autologous donors was 35 years, whereas that of allogeneic donors is 25 years. Of the 263 stem cell donors, we found 18 patients (autologous) and 2 donors (allogeneic) to be infected. We did not find any of the donors infected with HIV by the serology as well as the NAT testing protocol CONCLUSION: Donor screening and testing is the most critical parameter in stem cell transplantation in order to ensure the safety of the product to be transplanted. Modifications in the regulations related to donor screening are aimed at providing safe transplantation and negate the risk of accidental infection of the donor.","Alsuhaibani, Omar; Pereira, Winston Costa; Tareeqanwar, Mohammed; Khizzi, Nora El; Bakheswain, Saadia; Shaker, Amira; Elyamany, Ghaleb",Ann Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.5214/ans.0972.7531.220206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26130912/,211

There is a dearth of data investigating adoption of preventive behaviors in the initial phase of the A/H1N1 pandemic. METHODS: Three round of random, population-based, anonymous telephone survey were conducted in Hong Kong during the pre-community outbreak phase (May 7 to June 6, 2009) of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong (n = 999). RESULTS: Respectively, 46.65%, 88.75%, and 21.5% washed hands more than 10 times/day, wore face masks when having influenza-like illness (ILI), and wore face masks regularly in public areas. Perceptions related to bodily damages, efficacy of frequent handwashing, nonavailability of effective vaccines, high chance of having a large scale local outbreak, and mental distress because of influenza A/H1N1 were associated with frequent handwashing (odds ratio [OR], 1.46 to 2.15). Perceived vaccine availability was associated with face mask use when having ILI (OR, 1.60). Perceived fatality, efficacy of wearing face masks, and mental distress because of influenza A/H1N1 were associated with face mask use in public areas (OR, 1.53 to 2.52). CONCLUSION: Preventive behaviors were prevalently adopted by the public and were associated with cognitive and affective factors.

We aim to identify independent risk factors to serve as prediction markers for critical illness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Fifty-two critical and 200 non-critical SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive patients hospitalized in 15 hospitals outside Wuhan from January 19 to March 6, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Multivariable logistic regression and LASSO logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for critical illness. RESULTS: Age older than 60 years, dyspnea, respiratory rate > 24 breaths per min, leukocytosis > 9.5 × 10(9)/L, neutrophilia > 6.3 × 10(9)/L, lymphopenia < 1.1 × 10(9)/L, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 3.53, fibrinogen > 4 g/L, d-dimer > 0.55 μg/mL, blood urea nitrogen > 7.1 mM, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin > 21 μM, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 were identified as risk factors for critical illness. LASSO logistic regression identified the best combination of risk factors as SOFA score, age, dyspnea, and leukocytosis. The Area Under the Receiver-Operator Curve values for the risk factors in predicting critical illness were 0.921 for SOFA score, 0.776 for age, 0.764 for dyspnea, 0.658 for leukocytosis, and 0.960 for the combination of the four risk factors.

We aimed to investigate this association using the population based National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) data in the US. MethodsThe harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data from 54 clinical sites in N3C were used for this study. Logistic and multinominal logistic regression models were employed to estimate the association between HIV infection and hospitalization, mortality and clinical severity of COVID-19, with models being initially adjusted for age and sex, then cumulatively adjusted for race and ethnicity, smoking and obesity, and a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess modification effect by age, sex, and race. FindingsAmong a total of 1,436,622 adult COVID-19 cases between January 2020 and May 2021, 13,170 had HIV infection. A total of 26,130 deaths occurred, with 445 among PLWH. PLWH had higher risk of COVID-19 death and hospitalization than non-PLWH after adjusting for age and sex. The associations were attenuated, but remained significant, after adjusting for lifestyle factors and comorbidities (COVID-19 death: [adjusted OR(AOR): 1.38; 95%CI: 1.25-1.54]; hospitalization: [AOR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.18-1.28]). In terms of COVID-19 disease severity, PLWH were less likely to have mild/moderate illness but more likely to have severe illness when only controlling for demographics, smoking and BMI, although the estimated risk was obviated after controlling for comorbidities. Interaction terms revealed that the elevated risk was higher among older age group, males and black/African American. InterpretationPLWH in the US had increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality comparing with non-PLWH. The adverse COVID-19 outcomes might not only be accounted for by HIV but also by other risk factors that are highly prevalent in PLWH.

Ecosystem disturbances and decreased host species richness have been associated with the emergence of zoonotic diseases. In this study, we aimed at (a) characterizing the viral diversity in seven neotropical rodent species living in four types of habitats and (b) exploring how the extent of environmental disturbance influences this diversity. Through a metagenomic approach, we identified 77,767 viral sequences from spleen, kidney, and serum samples. These viral sequences were attributed to 27 viral families known to infect vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and amoeba. Viral diversities were greater in pristine habitats compared with disturbed ones, and lowest in peri-urban areas. High viral richness was observed in savannah areas. Differences in these diversities were explained by rare viruses that were generally more frequent in pristine forest and savannah habitats. Moreover, changes in the ecology and behavior of rodent hosts, in a given habitat, such as modifications to the diet in disturbed vs. pristine forests, are major determinants of viral composition. Lastly, the phylogenetic relationships of four vertebrate-related viral families (Polyomaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Phenuiviridae) highlighted the wide diversity of these viral families, and in some cases, a potential risk of transmission to humans. All these findings provide significant insights into the diversity of rodent viruses in Amazonia, and emphasize that habitats and the host’s dietary ecology may drive viral diversity. Linking viral richness and abundance to the ecology of their hosts and their responses to habitat disturbance could be the starting point for a better understanding of viral emergence and for future management of ecosystems.","Tirera, Sourakhata; de Thoisy, Benoit; Donato, Damien; Bouchier, Christiane; Lacoste, Vincent; Franc, Alain; Lavergne, Anne",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578272/,211

METHODS: Eight participants complete three trials in randomised order: one normothermic (CON) and two with elevated (38.5°C) core temperature, induced by prior immersion in neutral versus hot water The CON trial and one hot trial (HOT) used a water mouth-rinse following each cognitive task of the trial, (HOT) while the other used a menthol mouth-rinse (MENT). Participants walked in humid heat (33°C, 75% relative humidity) in military clothing, completing a cognitive battery of reaction time, perceptual processing, working memory, executive function, cognitive flexibility, vigilance, and declarative memory. RESULTS: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between any conditions. Near-infrared spectroscopy showed greater oxygenated haemoglobin tissue content in HOT and MENT compared to CON (ΔO(2)Hb-deO(2)Hb: 2.3 ± 4.5 µM, p < .024), and lower deoxygenated haemoglobin in MENT than in CON or HOT (p = .017), suggesting higher brain metabolism during the more stressful conditions. CONCLUSION: Moderately elevated core (38.5°C) and skin temperature does not appear to impair cognitive performance during exercise despite mildly elevated cerebral metabolism. The effects of menthol remain undetermined due to the lack of heat-mediated cognitive impairment.","Ashworth, Edward Tom; Cotter, James David; Kilding, Andrew Edward",Eur J Appl Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-020-04591-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426575/,211

610870,Stress levels in high-school students after a semester of home-schooling,2021-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has been associated primarily with pneumonia, recent data show that the causative agent of COVID‐19, the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), can infect a large number of vital organs beyond the lungs, such as the heart, kidneys, and the brain. Thus, there is evidence showing possible retrograde transmission of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to regions of the brain stem. METHODS: This is a literature review article. The research design method is an evidence‐based rapid review. The present discourse aim is first to scrutinize and assess the available literature on COVID‐19 repercussion on the central nervous system (CNS). Standard literature and database searches were implemented, gathered relevant material, and extracted information was then assessed. RESULTS: The angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors being the receptor for the virus, the threat to the central nervous system is expected. Neurons and glial cells express ACE2 receptors in the CNS, and recent studies suggest that activated glial cells contribute to neuroinflammation and the devastating effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on the CNS. The SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced immune‐mediated demyelinating disease, cerebrovascular damage, neurodegeneration, and depression are some of the neurological complications discussed here. CONCLUSION: This review correlates present clinical manifestations of COVID‐19 patients with possible neurological consequences in the future, thus preparing healthcare providers for possible future consequences of COVID‐19.","Mahalakshmi, Arehally M.; Ray, Bipul; Tuladhar, Sunanda; Bhat, Abid; Paneyala, Shasthara; Patteswari, Duraisamy; Sakharkar, Meena Kishore; Hamdan, Hamdan; Ojcius, David M.; Bolla, Srinivasa Rao; Essa, Musthafa Mohamed; Chidambaram, Saravana Babu; Qoronfleh, M.

Purdue University student pharmacists participated in a clinical research focused APPE in London, England. To prepare for this APPE, students completed a one-credit course focused on intercultural learning and travel preparation. The purpose of this report is to describe the implementation and assessment of ICL during this course and international APPE. The course includes interactive ICL activities, reflective assignments, and personalized assessments. During the eight-week APPE, student pharmacists worked on an individualized Intercultural Development Plan(®), which includes ICL activities, focused reflection, and check-ins. ICL was assessed using the Intercultural Development Inventory(®) (IDI(®)) at the beginning of the course and at least four weeks after APPE completion. Student APPE feedback was also reviewed for evidence of ICL. Twenty-seven students completed the course and APPE from 2018 to 2020. The average IDI developmental orientation (DO) before the course was 91.7, placing students in minimization. The average perceived orientation was 120.9, placing students in acceptance. There were 18 students who completed the post-APPE IDI: 12 students demonstrated growth in the DO (range: 1.5–23.72), and six students experienced a decrease in their DO. Intercultural learning can be implemented and assessed as part of an international APPE.","Schellhase, Ellen; Hasan, Ishmum; Hendricks, Stephanie; Miller, Monica L.",Pharmacy (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9010037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670428/,211

Unfortunately, psychologists are not included in these gala celebrations. It seems appropriate to take time to praise the hard work and dedication that is required to publish in an academic journal. The present article summarizes the results from the 3rd annual psychotherapy award program designed to highlight the valuable contributions made in eleven different categories. A total of 81 academic journals were reviewed for their articles published during 2019, and 150 papers were found useful and relevant to the field of psychotherapy. The list was then shortened to 44 articles that were organized into eleven award categories, and the best paper in each category was selected by a panel from the journal's editorial board.

Methods One hundred patients with(fifty) or without COVID-19 PCR positivity(fifty), were enrolled in a prospective cohort study after signing a written informed consent. Results The COVID-19 positive patients had significantly higher median VOC episodes/year i.e 3 /year (IQR, 1-6 /year) v/s 2 /year (IQR, 2-12 /year) (p < 0.05) respectively, however the need for hospitalization was similar. There was a higher culture proven infection in COVID-19 negative group (P = 0.05). COVID-19 positive group had more osteonecrosis (p < 0.05), splenic sequestration, splenomegaly, and hepatic crisis (P values 0.05, 0.006 and 0.02 respectively). Symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, abdominal pain and anosmia were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the COVID-19 positive patients. Both cohorts, showed a fall in the mean haemoglobin, lymphocyte subset, platelets, and reticulocytes, whereas, the LDH and ferritin were significantly elevated. In SCA COVID-19 positive patients the rise in WBC, reticulocyte%, platelets, and ferritin was subdued (p < 0.05). Two died in COVID-19 positive, whereas three died in the COVID-19 negative, without statistically significant difference in mortality. Conclusions Although COVID-19 infection may have triggered the onset of VOC, it did not significantly influence the morbidity or mortality in this SCA cohort.","Alkindi, S.; Elsadek, R.

619162,Implementing COVID-19 Mitigation in the Community Mental Health Setting: March 2020 and Lessons Learned,2020-07-17,"A surprising feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to date is the low burdens reported in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries relative to other global regions. Potential explanations (for example, warmer environments1, younger populations2-4) have yet to be framed within a comprehensive analysis. We synthesized factors hypothesized to drive the pace and burden of this pandemic in SSA during the period from 25 February to 20 December 2020, encompassing demographic, comorbidity, climatic, healthcare capacity, intervention efforts and human mobility dimensions. Large diversity in the probable drivers indicates a need for caution in interpreting analyses that aggregate data across low- and middle-income settings. Our simulation shows that climatic variation between SSA population centers has little effect on early outbreak trajectories; however, heterogeneity in connectivity, although rarely considered, is likely an important contributor to variance in the pace of viral spread across SSA. Our synthesis points to the potential benefits of context-specific adaptation of surveillance systems during the ongoing pandemic. In particular, characterizing patterns of severity over age will be a priority in settings with high comorbidity burdens and poor access to care. Understanding the spatial extent of outbreaks warrants emphasis in settings where low connectivity could drive prolonged, asynchronous outbreaks resulting in extended stress to health systems.","Rice, Benjamin L; Annapragada, Akshaya; Baker, Rachel E; Bruijning, Marjolein; Dotse-Gborgbortsi, Winfred; Mensah, Keitly; Miller, Ian F; Motaze, Nkengafac Villyen; Raherinandrasana, Antso; Rajeev, Malavika; Rakotonirina, Julio; Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Yu, Weiyu; Grenfell, Bryan T; Tatem, Andrew J; Metcalf, C Jessica E",Nat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531710/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01234-8,211

The spread rate and severity showed different properties within the COVID-19 different waves. The present work aims to compare the spread and the severity of the different waves using the available data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and death cases. Real-datasets collected from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science were used to perform a comparative study between COVID-19 different waves in 12 countries with the highest total performed tests for SARS-Cov-2 detection in the world (Italy, Brazil, Japan, Germany, Spain, India, USA, UAE, Poland, Colombia, Turkey, and Switzerland). The total number of confirmed cases and death cases in different waves of COVID-19 were compared to that of the previous one for equivalent periods. The total number of death cases in each wave was presented as a percentage of the total number of confirmed cases for the same periods. In all the selected 12 countries, wave 2 had a much higher number of confirmed cases than that in wave 1. However, the death cases increase was not comparable with that of the confirmed cases to the extent that some countries had lower death cases than in wave 1, UAE, and Spain. The death cases as a percentage of the total number of confirmed cases in wave 1 was much higher than that in wave 2. Some countries had waves 3 and 4. Waves 3 and 4 were had lower confirmed cases than wave 2, however, the death cases were variable in different countries. The death cases in waves 3 and 4 were similar to or higher than wave 2 in most countries. Wave 2 of COVID-19 had a much higher spread rate but much lower severity resulting in a lower death rate in wave 2 compared to that of the first wave. Waves 3 and 4 had lower confirmed cases than wave 2; that could be due to the presence of proper treatment and vaccination. However, that was not reflected in the death cases which were similar to or higher than wave 2 in most countries. Further studies are needed to explain these findings.

Knowledge of how to cure the disease is urgently needed. Emerging immune escaping mutants of the virus suggested that it may be potentially persistent in human society as a regular health threat as the flu virus. Therefore, it is imperative to identify appropriate biomarkers to indicate pathological and physiological states, and more importantly, clinic outcomes. Proteins are the performers of life functions, and their abundance and modification status can directly reflect the immune status. Protein glycosylation serves a great impact in modulating protein function. The use of both unmodified and glycosylated proteins as biomarkers has also been proved feasible in the studies of SARS, Zika virus, influenza, etc. In recent years, mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics, as well as proteomics approaches, advanced significantly due to the evolution of mass spectrometry. We focus on the current development of the mass spectrometry-based strategy for COVID-19 biomarkers’ investigation.

Social distancing, i.e., reducing interactions between individuals in order to slow down the spread of the virus, has become the new norm. In this viewpoint I will discuss the potential implications of social distancing on daily travel patterns. Avoiding social contact might completely change the number and types of out-of-home activities people perform, and how people reach these activities. It can be expected that the demand for travel will reduce and that people will travel less by public transport. Social distancing might negatively affect subjective well-being and health status, as it might result in social isolation and limited physical activity. As a result, walking and cycling, recreationally or utilitarian, can be important ways to maintain satisfactory levels of health and well-being. Policymakers and planners should consequently try to encourage active travel, while public transport operators should focus on creating ways to safely use public transport.","De Vos, Jonas",Transportation research interdisciplinary perspectives,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198220300324; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171016/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220300324?v=s5,211

These changes include anosmia and dysgeusia. In some cases, these clinical manifestations appear even before the general flu-like symptoms, e.g., sore throat, thoracic oppression and fever. There is no direct report available on the loss of these chemical senses in obese COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, obesity has been shown to be associated with low ONS cues. These alterations in obese subjects are due to obesity-induced altered expression of olfacto-taste receptors. Besides, obesity may further aggravate the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as this pathology is associated with a high degree of inflammation/immunosuppression and reduced protection against viral infections. Hence, obesity represents a great risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it may hide the viral-associated altered ONS symptoms, thus leading to a high mortality rate in these subjects.","Khan, Amira Sayed; Hichami, Aziz; Khan, Naim Akhtar",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650509/,211

In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed. AIMS: To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk/epidemiological factors. METHODS: Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit/paediatric intensive care unit were included. FINDINGS: Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N = 162) or RV (N = 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P = 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). RV-associated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P < 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and/or antibiotics (P < 0.05).

630781,Needs assessment for the creation of a community of practice in a community health navigator cohort,2021-07-05,"Seed security is being promoted as a means of achieving productivity, food security, and resilience among smallholders. This has resulted in notions that vulnerabilities among smallholders in Africa are the outcomes of inadequate adoption of improved seeds. What these perspectives have neglected is: How politics mediate access to seeds? and Whether and how politics influence farmers' perception of seed security? This study draws upon a case study of Northern Ghanaian Savannahs to examine politics and seed security among smallholders. The logistic analysis shows that the presence of recurring conflicts significantly determines how farmers perceived vulnerability to seed insecurity. Thus, farmers from relatively peaceful villages were 4.705 times more likely to rate themselves as not vulnerable to seed insecurity compared to their counterparts experiencing recurring conflicts. Analysis further shows that smallholder vulnerabilities to seed insecurity are constructed at the intersection of historical ethnic conflicts and neoliberal policies in ways that contest the dominant narratives. Key for achieving seed security is a better understanding of how local and macro politics influence perceptions and mediate access to healthy and desirable seeds.","Madin, Michael Biwalib",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230364/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-020-10340-y,211

To confirm that the prepared data can be discriminated using DL, image classification was performed using the VGG-16 network. We comprehensively investigated the performances of the learned networks in the regression problem. The generalization ability was evaluated from independent images with the unlearned χN. We found that, except for large χN values, the standard deviation values were approximately 0.1 and 0.5 for A-component fractions of 0.2 and 0.35, respectively. The images for larger χN values were more difficult to distinguish. In addition, the learning performances for the 4-class problem were comparable to those for the 8-class problem, except when the χN values were large. This information is useful for the analysis of real experimental image data, where the variation of samples is limited.","Hagita, Katsumi; Aoyagi, Takeshi; Abe, Yuto; Genda, Shinya; Honda, Takashi",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91761-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112914/,211

However, with the increase in drug repurposing initiatives, niclosamide has emerged as a true hit in many screens against various diseases. Indeed, from being an anthelmintic drug, it has now shown potential in treating Parkinson's disease, diabetes, viral and microbial infections, as well as various cancers. Such diverse pharmacological activities are a result of niclosamide's ability to uncouple mitochondrial phosphorylation and modulate a selection of signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β‐catenin, mTOR and JAK/STAT3, which are implicated in many diseases. In this highlight, we discuss the plethora of diseases that niclosamide has shown promise in treating.","Kadri, Hachemi; Lambourne, Olivia A.; Mehellou, Youcef",ChemMedChem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29603892/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.201800100,211

Therefore, large number of serological assays are developed in the commercial market to measure SARS CoV 2 antibodies, which requires evaluation before their application in large scale. Objectives To evaluate the performances of commercially available serological assays for detecting SARS CoV 2 antibodies. Methods The study compared the performances of six different methods for detection of antibodies against SARS CoV 2 which includes (i) Genscript SARS CoV 2 surrogate virus neutralization test kit [Test A] (ii) Diasorin SARS CoV 2 S1 S2 IgG detection [Test B] (iii) Alinity SARS CoV 2 IgG II [Test C] (iv) Diasorin SARS CoV 2 TrimericS IgG [Test D] (v) Roche Elecsys Anti SARS CoV 2 cobas [Test E] (vi) AESKULISA (AESKU Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) [Test F] against the gold standard Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). Results Test E had the highest sensitivity and Test A had the highest specificity The ROC for tests A, C, D and E showed optimum cutoffs that differed from the manufacturers recommendation. Test D had the best performance considering all the performance indicators with the highest agreement with the PRNT results. Parallel testing of test A with test D and test B had the optimum performance. Conclusion Serological assays that are commercially available are very promising and show good agreement with the standard PRNT results. Studies on large samples for optimization of the assay cutoff values and cost effective evaluations on parallel testing methods are needed to make recommendations on these commercial assays.","Mahmoud, D.

We aimed to synthesize all available research on the asymptomatic rates and transmission rates where possible. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 trials, and European PMC for pre-print platforms such as MedRxiv. We included primary studies reporting on asymptomatic prevalence where: (a) the sample frame includes at-risk population, and (b) there was sufficiently long follow up to identify pre-symptomatic cases. Meta-analysis used fixed effect and random effects models. Results: We screened 571 articles and included five low risk-of-bias studies from three countries (China (2), USA (2), Italy (1)) that tested 9,242 at-risk people, of which 413 were positive and 65 were asymptomatic. Diagnosis in all studies was confirmed using a RT-qPCR test. The proportion of asymptomatic cases ranged from 6% to 41%. Meta-analysis (fixed effect) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 16% (95% CI: 12% - 20%) overall; higher in non-aged care 19% (15% - 24%), and lower in long-term aged care 8% (4% - 14%). Two studies provided direct evidence of forward transmission of the infection by asymptomatic cases but suggested lower rates than symptomatic cases. Conclusion: Our estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are lower than many highly publicized studies, but still substantial. Further robust epidemiological evidence is urgently needed, including in sub-populations such as children, to better understand the importance of asymptomatic cases for driving spread of the pandemic.","Byambasuren, O.; Cardona, M.; Bell, K.; Clark, J.; McLaws, M.-L.; Glasziou, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097543; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.10.20097543v1?rss=1,211

These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30 g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological, muscular, cartilage, neurological, and cardiovascular health. The present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). Dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. Furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system.

635665,Early Intervention Protocols: Proposing a Default Bimodal Bilingual Approach for Deaf Children,2020-09-08,"The COVID-19 reported initially in December 2019 led to thousands and millions of people infections, deaths at a rapid scale, and a global scale. Metropolitans suffered serious pandemic problems as the built environments of metropolitans contain a large number of people in a relatively small area and allow frequent contacts to let virus spread through people's contacting with each other. The spread inside a metropolitan is heterogeneous, and we propose that the spatial variation of built environments has a measurable association with the spread of COVID-19. This paper is the pioneering work to investigate the missing link between the built environment and the spread of the COVID-19. In particular, we intend to examine two research questions: (1) What are the association of the built environment with the risk of being infected by the COVID-19? (2) What are the association of the built environment with the duration of suffering from COVID-19? Using the Hong Kong census data, confirmed cases of COVID-19 between January to August 2020 and large size of built environment sample data from the Hong Kong government, our analysis are carried out. The data is divided into two phases before (Phase 1) and during the social distancing measure was relaxed (Phase 2). Through survival analysis, ordinary least squares analysis, and count data analysis, we find that (1) In Phase 1, clinics and restaurants are more likely to influence the prevalence of COVID-19. In Phase 2, public transportation (i.e. MTR), public market, and the clinics influence the prevalence of COVID-19. (2) In Phase 1, the areas of tertiary planning units (i.e., TPU) with more restaurants are found to be positively associated with the period of the prevalence of COVID-19. In Phase 2, restaurants and public markets induce long time occurrence of the COVID-19. (3) In Phase 1, restaurant and public markets are the two built environments that influence the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. In Phase 2, the number of restaurants is positively related to the number of COVID-19 reported cases. It is suggested that governments should not be too optimistic to relax the necessary measures. In other words, the social distancing measure should remain in force until the signals of the COVID-19 dies out.","Yip, Tsz Leung; Huang, Yaoxuan; Liang, Cong",Build Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320308386?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250560/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107471; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132320308386,211

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that is easily transmitted from human to human through the respiratory route. Usually, it presents with fever, headache, fatigue accompanied by respiratory symptoms like cough and dyspnea, and other systemic involvements. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common lymphoproliferative neoplasm characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and demonstration of clonality unlike other causes of lymphocytosis. Patients with CLL are considered immunocompromised because of impaired humoral immunity (mainly) and cellular immunity. Therefore, they are vulnerable to various infections including COVID-19. Little is known about the COVID-19 infection when it unmasks CLL. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old man with no significant previous illnesses, and an unremarkable family history, presented with a moderate COVID-19 infection. He initially presented to the emergency department with fever and mild shortness of breath. A complete blood count showed a high white blood cell count with absolute lymphocytosis. Flow cytometry revealed the clonality of the lymphocytes confirming the diagnosis of CLL. Despite having CLL, he developed a moderate COVID-19 infection and recovered in a few days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CLL, which presented with a COVID-19 infection as the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytosis is an unexpected finding in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and the elevated lymphocytes may be indicative of other conditions. Secondary causes of lymphocytosis like malignancy or other infections should be considered in these cases.","Ali, Elrazi; Badawi, Mohamed; Abdelmahmuod, Elabbass; Kohla, Samah; Yassin, Mohamed A.",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098641/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.926062,211

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study, sitagliptin, an oral and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, was added to standard of care (e.g., insulin administration) at the time of hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Every center also recruited at a 1:1 ratio untreated control subjects matched for age and sex. All patients had pneumonia and exhibited oxygen saturation <95% when breathing ambient air or when receiving oxygen support. The primary end points were discharge from the hospital/death and improvement of clinical outcomes, defined as an increase in at least two points on a seven-category modified ordinal scale. Data were collected retrospectively from patients receiving sitagliptin from 1 March through 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Of the 338 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 admitted in Northern Italy hospitals included in this study, 169 were on sitagliptin, while 169 were on standard of care. Treatment with sitagliptin at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality (18% vs. 37% of deceased patients; hazard ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.29–0.66]; P = 0.0001), with an improvement in clinical outcomes (60% vs. 38% of improved patients; P = 0.0001) and with a greater number of hospital discharges (120 vs. 89 of discharged patients; P = 0.0008) compared with patients receiving standard of care, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study of patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, sitagliptin treatment at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality and improved clinical outcomes as compared with standard-of-care treatment.

A Pilot Study of Romantic Partner Influence on Exercise Adherence and Cardiometabolic Risk in African-American Couples,2020-11-11,"ABSTRACT Background The pandemic of COVID-19 is growing, and a shortage of masks and respirators has been reported globally. Policies of health organizations for healthcare workers are inconsistent, with a change in policy in the US for universal face mask use. The aim of this study was to review the evidence around the efficacy of masks and respirators for healthcare workers, sick patients and the general public. Methods A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials on use of respiratory protection by healthcare workers, sick patients and community members was conducted. Articles were searched on Medline and Embase using key search terms. Results A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study – 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks appeared to be more effective than hand hygiene alone, and both together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts. Conclusion The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings. Trials in healthcare workers support the use of respirators continuously during a shift. This may prevent health worker infections and deaths from COVID-19, as aerosolisation in the hospital setting has been documented.","MacIntyre, C.

We assessed two reform packages, performance-based financing (PBF) and direct facility financing (DFF), against each other and business-as-usual for maternal and child healthcare (MCH) provision in Nigeria. METHODS: We sampled 571 facilities (269 in PBF; 302 in DFF) in 52 districts randomly assigned to PBF or DFF, and 215 facilities in 25 observable-matched control districts. PBF facilities received $2 ($1 for operating grants plus $1 for bonuses) for every $1 received by DFF facilities (operating grants alone). Both received autonomy, supervision, and enhanced community engagement, isolating the impact of additional performance-linked facility and health worker payments. Facilities and households with recent pregnancies in facility catchments were surveyed at baseline (2014) and endline (2017). Outcomes were Penta3 immunization, institutional deliveries, modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR), four-plus antenatal care (ANC) visits, insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) use by under-fives, and directly observed quality of care (QOC). We estimated difference-in-differences with state fixed effects and clustered standard errors. RESULTS: PBF increased institutional deliveries by 10% points over DFF and 7% over business-as-usual (p<0.01). PBF and DFF were more effective than business-as-usual for Penta3 (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively); PBF also for mCPR (p<0.05). Twenty-one of 26 QOC indicators improved in both PBF and DFF relative to business-as-usual (p<0.05). However, except for deliveries, PBF was as or less effective than DFF: Penta3 immunization and ITN use were each 6% less than DFF (p<0.1 for both) and QOC gains were also comparable. Utilization gains come from the middle of the rural wealth distribution (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that both PBF and DFF represent significant improvements over business-as-usual for service provision and quality of care. However, except for institutional delivery, PBF and DFF do not differ from each other despite PBF disbursing $2 for every dollar disbursed by DFF. These findings highlight the importance of direct facility financing and decentralization in improving PHC and suggest potential complementarities between the two approaches in strengthening MCH service delivery.

642951,COVID-19 vaccine use in immunocompromised patients: A commentary on evidence and recommendations,2021-08-29,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 99% of adults in Hong Kong use face masks in public. With the limited supply of face masks in the market and the uncertainty about the future development of COVID-19, reusing face masks is a legitimate way to reduce usage. Although this practice is not recommended, reusing face masks is common in Hong Kong. This study aimed to examine the practice of reusing face masks among adults in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with their health beliefs toward this health crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. A quota sample of 1000 adults was recruited in Hong Kong in April 2020. Guided by the Health Belief Model, the subjects were invited to answer questions on their practice of reusing face masks and health beliefs toward COVID-19 through telephone interview. Their practice on reuse, storage, and decontamination of used face masks were summarized by descriptive statistics. The difference in health beliefs between the subjects who reused and did not reuse face masks was examined by conducting an independent t test. The association between health beliefs and reuse of face masks was determined by conducting a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One-third (n = 345, 35.4%) of the subjects reused face masks in an average of 2.5 days. Among them, 207 subjects stored and 115 subjects decontaminated their used face masks by using various methods. The subjects who reused face masks significantly perceived having inadequate face masks (t = 3.905; p < 0.001). Having a higher level of perception of having inadequate face masks increased the likelihood of reusing face masks (OR = 0.784; CI 95%: 0.659–0.934; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Despite having 90 face masks in stock, the adults who reused face masks significantly perceived that they had inadequate face masks. Concerted effort of health care professionals, community organizations, and the government will improve individuals’ practice in use of face masks and alleviate their actual and perceived feeling of having inadequate face masks, which lead them to reuse.","Lee, Linda Yin-king; Chan, Issac Chun-wing; Wong, Owen Pak-man; Ng, Yaki Hoi-ying; Ng, Crystal Kit-ying; Chan, Max Hin-wa; Ng, Joe Ka-chun; Koo, Hailey Hei-tung; Lam, Suk-ting; Chu, Ada Cho-wai; Wong, Rachel Yuen-shan; Leung, Heidi Po-ying; Pun, Angel Lok-ching",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34187439/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11346-y,211
646538,Suicidality in children and adolescents: lessons to be learned from the COVID-19 crisis,2020-06-02,"Recent outbreaks of zoonotic coronaviruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have caused tremendous casualties and great economic shock. Although some repurposed drugs have shown potential therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, specific therapeutic agents targeting coronaviruses have not yet been developed. During coronavirus replication, a replicase gene cluster, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is alternatively translated via a process called -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF) by an RNA pseudoknot structure encoded in viral RNAs. The coronavirus frameshifting has been identified previously as a target for antiviral therapy. In this study, the frameshifting efficiencies of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were determined using an in vitro −1 PRF assay system. Our group has searched approximately 9689 small molecules to identify potential −1 PRF inhibitors. Herein, we found that a novel compound, 2-(5-acetylthiophen-2yl)furo[2,3-b]quinoline (KCB261770), inhibits the frameshifting of MERS-CoV and effectively suppresses viral propagation in MERS-CoV-infected cells. The inhibitory effects of 87 derivatives of furo[2,3-b]quinolines were also examined showing less prominent inhibitory effect when compared to compound KCB261770. We demonstrated that KCB261770 inhibits the frameshifting without suppressing cap-dependent translation. Furthermore, this compound was able to inhibit the frameshifting, to some extent, of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the novel compound 2-(5-acetylthiophen-2yl)furo[2,3-b]quinoline may serve as a promising drug candidate to interfere with pan-coronavirus frameshifting.","Ahn, Dae-Gyun; Yoon, Gun Young; Lee, Sunhee; Ku, Keun Bon; Kim, Chonsaeng; Kim, Kyun-Do; Kwon, Young-Chan; Kim, Geon-Woo; Kim, Bum-Tae; Kim, Seong-Jun",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452503/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081639,211

The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from 2008 to 2020 in the SUS and to assess the impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the number of procedures and death rate of CABG performed in 2020 through the database DATASUS. METHODS: This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures and death rates. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. RESULTS: We identified 281,760 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2020. The average number of procedures until the end of 2019 was of 22,104. During 2020 there was a 25% reduction CABG procedures, to 16,501. There was an increase in the national death rate caused by a statistical significant increase in death rates in Brazil's Southeast and Central‐west regions. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic remains a global challenge for Brazil's health care system. During the year of 2020 there was a reduction in access to CABG related to an increase in the number of COVID‐19 cases. There was also an increase in the national CABG death rate.","Khalil, Kalil Hussein; Sá, Michel Pompeu B.

The lockdown was employed to delay the pandemic. However, it had an unintentional impact on acute cardiovascular care, especially acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Observational studies have shown a decrease in hospital admissions for AMI in several developed countries during the pandemic period.We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the AMI admissions patterns across India. METHODS: In this multicentric, retrospective, cross-sectional study, we included all AMI cases admitted to participating hospitals during the study period 15(th) March to 15(th) June 2020 and compared them using a historical control of all cases of AMI admitted during the corresponding period in the year 2019. Major objective of the study is to analyze the changes inthe number of hospital admissions for AMI in hospitals across India. In addition, we intend to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the weekly AMI admission rates, and other performance measures like rates of thrombolysis/primary percutaneous interventions (PCI), window period, door to balloon time, and door to needle time. Other objectives include evaluation of changes in the major complications and mortality rates of AMI and its predictors during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This CSI-AMI study will provide scientific evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on AMI care in India. Based on this study, we may be able to suggest appropriate changes to the existing MI guidelines and to educate the public regarding emergency care for AMI during COVID-19 pandemic.","Ramakrishnan, Sivasubramanian; Jabir, Abdullakutty; Jayagopal, Pathiyil Balagopalan; Mohanan, Padinhare Purayil; Nair, Venugopal Krishnan; Das, Mrinal Kanti; Mandal, Manoranjan; Roy, Debabrata; Reddy, Seemala Saikrishna; Malviya, Amit; Singh, Bateshwar Prasad; Bharti, Bishwa Bhushan; Majumder, Biswajit; Karunadas, Chakkalakkal Prabhakaran; Meena, Chandra Bhan; Girish, Meennahalli Palleda; Ezhilan, Janakiraman; Tummala, Karthik; Katyal, Virender Kumar; Subramanyam, Kodangala; Goyal, Krishna Kishore; Kenchappa, Kumar; Gupta, Mohit Dayal; Hanumanthappa, Natesh Bangalore; Bardoloi, Neil; Modi, Nitin; Bhattacharyya, Pranab Jyoti; Gadkari, Pushkraj; Patil, Rahul Raosaheb; Murty, Rambhatla Suryanarayana; Baruah, Rituparna; Krishnappa, Santhosh; Kumar, Satish; Routray, Satyanarayan; Tewari, Satyendra; Gupta, Shashi Bhushan; Maduramuthu, Sivabalan; Yerram, Sreekanth; Kumar, Sudeep; Jadhav, Uday; Manjunath, Cholenahally Nanjappa; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj; Kerker, Prafulla; Yadav, Rakesh; Guha, Santanu; Deb, Pradip Kumar; Zachariah, Geevar",Indian Heart J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ihj.2020.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357642/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019483220302273; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483220302273?v=s5,211
649271,Morbidity in the COVID‐19 era: Ethanol intoxication secondary to hand sanitiser ingestion,2020-08-05,"BACKGROUND: During the validation of a highly sensitive pan-species coronavirus (CoV) semi-nested RT-PCR assay, we found canine CoV (CCoV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from eight (2.5%) of 301 patients hospitalized with pneumonia during 2017-18 in Sarawak, Malaysia. Most patients were children living in rural areas with frequent exposure to domesticated animals and wildlife. METHODS: Specimens were further studied with universal and species-specific CoV and CCoV one-step RT-PCR assays, and viral isolation was performed in A72 canine cells. Complete genome sequencing was conducted using Sanger method. RESULTS: Two of eight specimens contained sufficient amounts of CCoVs as confirmed by less-sensitive single-step RT-PCR assays, and one specimen demonstrated cytopathic effects (CPE) in A72 cells. Complete genome sequencing of the virus causing CPE identified it as a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus (genotype II) that we named CCoV-HuPn-2018. Most of CCoV-HuPn-2018 genome is more closely related to a CCoV TN-449, while its S gene shared significantly higher sequence identity with CCoV-UCD-1 (S1 domain) and a feline CoV WSU 79-1683 (S2 domain). CCoV-HuPn-2018 is unique for a 36 nt (12-aa) deletion in the N protein and the presence of full-length and truncated 7b non-structural protein which may have clinical relevance. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus isolated from a human pneumonia patient. If confirmed as a pathogen, it may represent the eighth unique coronavirus known to cause disease in humans. Our findings underscore the public health threat of animal CoVs and a need to conduct better surveillance for them.","Vlasova, Anastasia N; Diaz, Annika; Damtie, Debasu; Xiu, Leshan; Toh, Teck-Hock; Lee, Jeffrey Soon-Yit; Saif, Linda J; Gray, Gregory C",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013321/,211
649608,"General Public Perception of Social Media, Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic, and Related Misconceptions",2021-07-15,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in the suspension of many routine audiology services due to the risk of cross-infections in closed spaces. This has driven the need for exploring alternatives to conventional face-to-face consultations in the hospital outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of remote consultations and assessments for patients on the waiting list for consideration of bone conduction hearing devices (BCHDs), and whether this type of consultation could continue beyond the COVID-19 era. METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study in a tertiary Neuro-otology Department. All new patients on the waiting list for assessment for BCHD as of 1 March 2020 were included. Patients’ case notes were reviewed. All underwent a telephone consultation with an implant audiologist. If the patient wanted to go ahead with the remote trial, a BCHD sound processor on a headband would be mailed out and the patient would then have to use the device for two weeks and return the device after with their diary. RESULTS: There were 49 patients. The mean age was 55 (range 27–88, SD 16.3). Four did not proceed with the trial. All patients returned their devices to the department. Majority of patients (95.6%, n = 43), completed their diary. 75.6% wanted to proceed with surgery. All patients proceeding with surgery were happy with the remote assessment and would recommend this for the future. CONCLUSION: It is possible to satisfactorily assess appropriately screened patients for BCHDs remotely with a structured approach and explanation of process and expectations. It might be possible to consider this type of consultation as an option for assessing potential candidates for BCHDs beyond the COVID-19 era to reduce the number of hospital visits for patients.","Lau, Kimberley; Greenwood, Larissa; Proctor, Vicki; Yardley, Mark; Ray, Jaydip",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34363503/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-021-07025-8,211

At present, the management of COVID 19 largely depends on antiviral therapeutics along with the anti-inflammatory drug. The vaccine is under the final clinical phase, and emergency use is available. We aim at ACE2 and Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase as potential drug candidate in COVID 19 management in the present work. For drug designing, various computational simulation strategies have been employed like Swiss-Model, Hawk Dock, HDOCK, py Dock, and PockDrug for homology modeling, binding energies of the molecule with a target, simulate the conformation and binding poses, statistics of protein lock with target key and drug ability, respectively. The current in-silico screening depicts that the spike protein receptor is complementary to the target when bound to each other and forms a stable complex. The MMGBSA free energy binding property of receptor and ligand is critical. The intermolecular Statistics with the target Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase complex are plausible. We have also observed a high-affinity pocket binding site with the target. Therefore, the favorable intermolecular interactions and Physico-chemical properties emanate as a drug candidate treating COVID-19. This study has approached computational tools to analyze the conformation, binding affinity, and drug ability of receptor-ligand. Thus, the spike receptor with its ACE2 receptor with Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase complex would be a potent drug against SARS CoV-2 and can cure the infection as per consensus scoring.","Siddiqa, M A.; Rao, D.

An aberrant inflammatory response and impaired respiratory function have been suggested as underlying mechanisms. We investigated whether obesity is associated with differences in inflammatory, respiratory, and clinical outcome parameters in critically ill COVID-19 patients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sixty-seven COVID-19 ICU patients were divided into obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2), n = 18, 72% class I obesity, 28% class II obesity) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m(2), n = 49) groups. Concentrations of circulating interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) were determined from ICU admission until 10 days afterward, and routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected. RESULTS: BMI was 32.6 [31.2–34.5] and 26.0 [24.4–27.7] kg/m(2) in the obese and non-obese group, respectively. Apart from temperature, which was significantly lower in obese patients (38.1 [36.9–38.9] vs. 38.7 [38.0 −39.5] °C, p = 0.02), there were no between-group differences on ICU admission. Plasma cytokine concentrations declined over time (p < 0.05 for all), but no differences between obese and non-obese patients were observed. Also, BMI did not correlate with the cytokine response (IL-6 r = 0.09, p = 0.61, TNF-α r = 0.03, p = 0.99, IP-10 r = 0.28, p = 0.11). The kinetics of clinical inflammatory parameters and respiratory mechanics were also similar in both groups. Finally, no differences in time on ventilator, ICU length of stay or 40-day mortality between obese and non-obese patients were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU, a higher BMI is not related to a different immunological response, unfavorable respiratory mechanics, or impaired outcome.","Kooistra, Emma J.; de Nooijer, Aline H.; Claassen, Wout J.; Grondman, Inge; Janssen, Nico A.

651959,Optimism in times of despair– A perspective from a Forensic mental health rehabilitation unit,2020-08-29,"INTRODUCTION: The initial International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 contains the first reference to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights (SRHR). It has been considered agreed language on SRHR in future United Nations (UN) documents. However, opposition to SRHR in global forums has increased, including in conjunction with an increase in religious, far-right populist politics. This study provides an empirical analysis of UN documents to discover whether opposition to SRHR has resulted in changes in the language on SRHR between and what these changes are. METHODS: This is a qualitative policy analysis in which 14 UN resolutions, 6 outcome documents from the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) and 522 country and group statements and 5 outcome reports from the Commission on Population and Development were collected from the organisations websites from 2014 to 2019. Framework analysis was used. The text from documents was charted and indexed and themes developed from these. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a disappearance of the language on abortion in the CSW outcome documents from 2017 and a change in the language on comprehensive sexuality education in the CSW as well as the UN General Assembly resolutions from 2018. This change included a removal of ‘sexuality’ to an increased emphasis on the role of families. Furthermore, documents showed an inability of some states to accept any mention of sexual and reproductive health at all, expanding from the usual contestations over abortion. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the global shift in politics and anti-SRHR actors at UN negotiations and conferences have removed previously agreed on language on SRHR from future UN resolutions and outcome documents. This is a concern for the global realisation of SRHR.","Gilby, Lynda; Koivusalo, Meri; Atkins, Salla",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781994/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004659,211
652088,COVID-19 in the Indigenous Population of Brazil,2020-10-06,"PURPOSE: In the elderly population, the influenza infection and its clinical complications are important causes of hospitalization and death, particularly, in longer-lived age. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of influenza virus circulation on mortality in the elderly and adults, in years with different predominant virus strains. METHODS: We performed a time trend study to evaluated excess of mortality for pneumonia and influenza, respiratory disease, and all-causes in southern region of Brazil, from 2002 to 2015. After considering other models, we opted for Serfling regression. Excess of death rates per 100,000 inhabitants were analyzed in specific age groups (24–59, 60–69, 70–79, ≥80 years) and by year of occurrence. Mortality information were taken from Brazilian Mortality Information System and etiological data were accessed in Sentinel Virological Surveillance database, getting the weekly positivity of the immunofluorescence tests for influenza A (H1N1, H3N2), and B. RESULTS: In southern Brazil, there is an evident seasonal pattern of all death outcomes among different age groups in the dry and cold season (April–September). The highest excess mortality rates occurs among older, particularly in years of circulation of influenza AH3N2, especially among people ≥80 years, in 2003 and 2007—years of great severity of influenza activity. After 2009, with the introduction of the pandemic influenza AH1N1, we observed a lower impact on the mortality of the elderly compared to <60 years. DISCUSSION: A cross reactivity antibody response from past exposure probably provided protection against disease in the elderly. Despite not controlling for comorbidities, climate, and vaccination, for the >70 years, ratio of respiratory diseases excess mortality rates between AH1N1 (2009) and severe year of H3N2 (2007) shows protection in the pandemic year and great vulnerability during AH3N2 virus predominance. CONCLUSION: The reduced immune response to infection, and to vaccination, and presence of comorbidities recommend a special attention to this age group in Brazil. Besides medical assistance, the timeliness of vaccine campaigns, its composition, and etiological surveillance of respiratory diseases are some of the preventive and public health measures.","Freitas, André Ricardo Ribas; Donalisio, Maria Rita",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375560/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01903,211

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, bioRxiv and medRxiv were surveyed up to 8th February 2021 for studies reporting data on mortality of patients with COVID-19 after IHCA. The primary outcome sought was mortality (in-hospital or at 30 days) after IHCA with attempted CPR. Additional outcomes were the overall rate of IHCA, the rate of non-shockable presenting rhythms, the rate of ROSC and the rate of survival with favorable neurological status. RESULTS: Ten articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, for a total of 1179 COVID-19 patients after IHCA with attempted CPR. The estimated overall mortality rate (in-hospital or at 30 days) was 89.9% (95% Predicted Interval [P.I.] 83.1%–94.2%; 1060/1179 patients; I(2) = 82%). The estimated rate of non-shockable presenting rhythms was 89% (95% P.I. 82.8%-93.1%; 1022/1205 patients; I(2) = 85%), and the estimated rate of ROSC was 32.9% (95% P.I. 26%-40.6%; 365/1205 patients; I(2) = 82%). The estimated overall rate of survival with favorable neurological status at 30 days was 6.3% (95% P.I. 4%-9.7%; 50/851 patients; I(2) = 48%).

We demonstrate that despite the large size of the viral RNA genome (~30 kb), infectious full-length cDNA is readily assembled in vitro by a circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) methodology without the need for technically demanding intermediate steps. Overlapping cDNA fragments are generated from viral RNA and assembled together with a linker fragment containing CMV promoter into a circular full-length viral cDNA in a single reaction. Transfection of the circular cDNA into mammalian cells results in the recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus that exhibits properties comparable to the parental virus in vitro and in vivo. CPER is also used to generate insect-specific Casuarina virus with ~20 kb genome and the human pathogens Ross River virus (Alphavirus) and Norovirus (Calicivirus), with the latter from a clinical sample. Additionally, reporter and mutant viruses are generated and employed to study virus replication and virus-receptor interactions.","Amarilla, Alberto A.; Sng, Julian D.

AIM: To describe the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and citric acid (SPMC) bowel preparation in children. METHODS: Phase 3, randomized, assessor-blinded, multicenter study of low-volume, divided dose SPMC enrolled children 9-16 years undergoing elective colonoscopy. Participants 9-12 years were randomized 1:1:1 to SPMC ½ dose × 2, SPMC 1 dose × 2, or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Participants 13-16 years were randomized 1:1 to SPMC 1 dose × 2 or PEG. PEG-based bowel preparations were administered per local protocol. Primary efficacy endpoint for quality of bowel preparation was responders (rating of 'excellent' or 'good') by modified Aronchick Scale. Secondary efficacy endpoint was participant's tolerability and satisfaction from a 7-item questionnaire. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs) and laboratory evaluations. RESULTS: 78 participants were randomized, 48 were 9-12 years, 30 were 13-16 years. For the primary efficacy endpoint in 9-12 years, 50.0%, 87.5%, and 81.3% were responders for SPMC ½ dose × 2, SPMC 1 dose × 2, and PEG groups, respectively. Responder rates for 13-16 years were 81.3% for SPMC 1 dose × 2 and 85.7% for PEG. Overall, 43.8% of participants receiving SPMC 1 dose × 2 reported it was 'very easy' or 'easy' to drink, compared with 20.0% receiving PEG. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 45.5% of participants receiving SPMC 1 dose × 2 and 63.0% receiving PEG. CONCLUSION: SPMC was an efficacious and safe for bowel preparation in children 9-16 years, with comparable efficacy to PEG.

Beginning early in the pandemic, at the University Health Network in Toronto, cancer care rapidly transitioned from in-person to virtual outpatient cancer care. Elective surgeries were also restricted, particularly for low risk malignancies. We herein discuss our experience conducting an ongoing study on decision-making regarding surgery or active surveillance for small, low risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study protocol was adapted due to safety considerations, including adopting virtual telephone/video teleconferencing patient visits and verbal consent procedures, and allowing for increased flexibility in appointment scheduling. We discuss some preliminary observations on our study process and outcomes during the pandemic. ABSTRACT: We describe our experience conducting a prospective observational cohort study on the management of small, low risk papillary thyroid cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study participants are given the choice of active surveillance (AS) or surgery, and those in the AS arm are followed at the study center, whereas surgical patients undergo usual care. During the pandemic we have transitioned from in-person research patient visits to largely virtual care of patients under AS. As of 30 October 2020, we had enrolled 181 patients enrolled in our study (including 25 during the pandemic), of which 92.3% (167/181) consented to telephone communication and 79.0% (143/181) consented to secure videoconferencing communication. Prior to the pandemic, 74.5% (117/157) of our patients chose AS over surgery, whereas during the pandemic, 96.0% (24/25) chose AS. Of the 133 study patients who were under AS within the timeframe from 12 March 2020, to 30 October 2020, the percentage of patients who missed appointments was 8.3% (11/133, for neck ultrasound and physician visits, respectively) and delayed appointments was 23.3% (31/133). This preliminary data suggests that prospective observational research on AS of thyroid cancer can safely continue during the pandemic.","Sawka, Anna M.; Ghai, Sangeet; Ihekire, Ogemdi; Jones, Jennifer M.; Gafni, Amiram; Baxter, Nancy N.; Goldstein, David P.; Group, on behalf of the Canadian Thyroid Cancer Active Surveillance Study",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13030371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498497/,211

These proteins are critical components of the innate immune system and function to limit the severity and host range of virus infections. Here we review the current knowledge on the mechanisms of action of several restriction factors that affect multiple viruses at distinct stages of their life cycles. For example, APOBEC3G deaminates cytosines to hypermutate reverse transcribed viral DNA; IFITM3 alters membranes to inhibit virus membrane fusion; MXA/B oligomerize on viral protein complexes to inhibit virus replication; SAMHD1 decreases dNTP intracellular concentrations to prevent reverse transcription of retrovirus genomes; tetherin prevents release of budding virions from cells; Viperin catalyzes formation of a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases; and ZAP binds virus RNAs to target them for degradation. We also discuss countermeasures employed by specific viruses against these restriction factors, and mention secondary functions of several of these factors in modulating immune responses. These important examples highlight the diverse strategies cells have evolved to combat virus infections.","Chemudupati, Mahesh; Kenney, Adam D.; Bonifati, Serena; Zani, Ashley; McMichael, Temet M.; Wu, Li; Yount, Jacob S.",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488918304166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30290238/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488918304166; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2018.09.012,211

We performed our analysis using GeneWeaver (GW), Reactome, and several biomedical ontologies to represent and compare common COVID-19 comorbidities. Phenotypic analysis of shared genes revealed significant enrichment for immune system phenotypes and for cardiovascular-related phenotypes, which might point to alleles and phenotypes in mouse models that could be evaluated for clues to COVID-19 severity.

663668,Theoretical orientation of a range of psychological approaches to address mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries. Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students’ perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1–10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students’ psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak.","Al-Rabiaah, Abdulkarim; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman A.; Hasan, Gamal M.; Al-Zamil, Fahad; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Alsohime, Fahad; Jamal, Amr; Alhaboob, Ali; Al-Saadi, Basma; Somily, Ali Mohammed",J Infect Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32001194/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120300058; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120300058,211

The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.","Weber, Jan; Klein, Timo; Abeln, Vera",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093553/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75127-0,211

On day 8, saline microbubble contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography revealed a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with RTLIAS. Invasive ventilation was initiated the next day. The course was complicated by intermittent severe desaturation without worsening aeration or haemodynamic instability, so PFO closure was considered. However, on day 12, saline microbubble contrast-enhanced transoesophageal echocardiography excluded RTLIAS. The patient was extubated on day 27 and discharged home 12 days later. Thus, RTLIAS may be dynamic and changes can be detected and monitored by serial imaging.

Understanding infection dynamics has important implications for methods employed in hospitals to prevent nosocomial-transmission events. Methods In this case series report we describe a cluster of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) in a tertiary care university hospital, in the early phases of the epidemic, after hospital visiting had been stopped and when the UK lockdown was in place. Findings A 48 year old patient developed COVID-19 31 days post-admission and four days after admission to a medical ward from ITU. Infection was likely acquired from an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare worker (HCW). Subsequent investigation over a 14 day period revealed symptoms in 23 staff members and five linked cases in patients on the same ward. Nine of the 23 affected staff members provided care for and had direct exposure with the index case. Four staff reported caring for the index case without use of personal protective equipment. One was coughed on directly by the patient 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. Conclusion SARS CoV2 infection can be introduced to a ward area by asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic healthcare workers. Staff members and patients can act as Trojan horses carrying infection into and around the hospital, setting up unexpected transmission events. Transmission of infection from pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic individuals means that universal use of measures to prevent transmission is required for successful reduction of transmission events in the hospital setting.","Asad, H.; Johnston, C.; Blyth, I.; Holborow, A.; Bone, A.; Porter, L.; Tidswell, P.; Healy, B.",Infection prevention in practice,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088920300378; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590088920300378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100073,211

Controlling of COVID-19 spreading rate in the social environment is a challenge for all individuals. In the present study, simulation of the lockdown effect on the COVID-19 spreading rate in India and mapping of its recovery percentage (until May, 2020) were investigated. Investigation of the lockdown impact dependent on first order reaction kinetics demonstrated higher effect of lockdown 1 on controlling the COVID-19 spreading rate when contrasted with lockdown 2 and 3. Although decreasing trend was followed for the reaction rate constant of different lockdown stages, the distinction between the lockdown 2 and 3 was minimal. Mathematical and feed forward neural network (FFNN) approaches were applied for the simulation of COVID-19 spreading rate. In case of mathematical approach, exponential model indicated adequate performance for the prediction of the spreading rate behavior. For the FFNN based modeling, 1-5-1 was selected as the best architecture so as to predict adequate spreading rate for all the cases. The architecture also showed effective performance in order to forecast number of cases for next 14 days. The recovery percentage was modeled as a function of number of days with the assistance of polynomial fitting. Therefore, the investigation recommends proper social distancing and efficient management of corona virus in order to achieve higher decreasing trend of reaction rate constant and required recovery percentage for the stabilization of India.","Chakraborty, Sourav; Choudhary, Arun Kumar; Sarma, Mausumi; Hazarika, Manuj Kumar",Infect Dis Model,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300476?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989426/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300476,211

Many EDs have leveraged telehealth to innovatively respond to these challenges. This review describes the landscape of telehealth initiatives in emergency care that have been described during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the literature using PubMed, supplemented by a review of the gray literature (ie, non‐peer reviewed), with input from subject matter experts to identify telehealth initiatives in emergency care during coronavirus disease 2019. We categorized types of telehealth use based on purpose and user characteristics. RESULTS: We included 27 papers from our review of the medical literature and another 8 sources from gray literature review. The vast majority of studies (32/35) were descriptive in nature, with the additional inclusion of 2 cohort studies and one randomized clinical trial. There were 5 categories of ED telehealth use during the pandemic: (1) pre‐ED evaluation and screening, (2) within ED (including as a means of limiting staff and patient exposure and facilitating consultation with specialists), (3) post‐ED discharge monitoring and treatment, (4) educating trainees and health care workers, and (5) coordinating resources and patient care. CONCLUSION: Telehealth has been used in a variety of manners during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, enabling innovation in emergency care delivery. The findings from this study can be used by institutions to consider how telehealth may address challenges in emergency care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and beyond. Because few studies included cost data and given the variability in institutional resources, how organizations implement telehealth programs will likely vary. Future work should further explore barriers and facilitators of innovation, and the impact on care delivery and patient outcomes.","Jaffe, Todd A.; Hayden, Emily; Uscher‐Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Schwamm, Lee H.; Mehrotra, Ateev; Zachrison, Kori S.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969356/; https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12443,211

We assessed renal involvement of COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong, including the association with risk factors, length of hospitalization, critical presentation and mortality. METHOD: Linked electronic records of all confirmed patients from 5 major designated hospitals were extracted. Primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital AKI. Secondary outcomes were AKI-associated mortality, incident RRT, intensive care admission, prolonged hospitalization and disease course (defined as >90th percentile of hospitalization duration and duration from symptom onset to discharge, respectively), and change of eGFR. Patients were further stratified into being symptomatic or asymptomatic. RESULTS: Patients were characterized by young age (median:38.4, IQR:28.4-55.8 years old) and short time (Median:5, IQR:2-9 days) from symptom onset to admission. Among the 591 patients, 22 (3.72%) developed AKI and 4 (0.68%) required RRT. AKI increased the odds of prolonged hospitalization and disease course by 2.0 and 3.5 folds, respectively. Estimated GFR 24 weeks post-discharge reduced by 7.51 and 1.06 ml/min/1.73m(2) versus baseline (at admission) in the AKI and non-AKI groups, respectively. The incidence of AKI was comparable between asymptomatic (4.8%) and symptomatic (3.7%) patients. CONCLUSION: The overall rate of AKI among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong is low, which could be attributable to a vigilant screening program and early hospitalization. Among patients who developed in-hospital AKI, the duration of hospitalization is prolonged and kidney function impairment can persist for up to 6 months post-discharge.

In particular, since from the beginning of the pandemic it has been clear that people from Black and African American backgrounds seem to be hit especially hard by the virus, creating a substantial infection gap. The observed abnormal impact on these ethnic groups could probably be due to the co-occurrence of other known risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation and response to cures, although those factors do not seem able to explain fully and in depth the excess incidence of infections and deaths among African Americans. Here, we introduce the concept of diffusion segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on major US cities, we found that the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in African American communities at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with their level of diffusion segregation. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is potentially much more important to contain and curb the spreading of infectious diseases.","Bassolas, Aleix; Sousa, Sandro; Nicosia, Vincenzo",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499765/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0961,211

Here, we investigated self-reported life satisfaction during the first wave of the pandemic in Sweden, and perceived changes in life satisfaction in relation to various sociodemographic factors. A total of 1082 people (mean age 48 (SD 12.2); 82% women) responded to an online survey during autumn 2020 including the “Life Satisfaction Questionnaire-11”. A majority (69%) were satisfied with life as a whole, and with other important life domains, with the exception of contact with friends and sexual life. An equal share reported that life as a whole had either deteriorated (28%) or improved (29%). Of those that perceived a deterioration, 95% considered it to be due to the pandemic. Regarding deteriorated satisfaction with life as a whole, higher odds were found in the following groups: having no children living at home; being middle aged; having other sources of income than being employed; and having a chronic disease. The Swedish strategy might have contributed to the high proportion of satisfied people. Those who perceived a deterioration in life satisfaction may, however, need attention from Swedish Welfare Authorities.","Brogårdh, Christina; Hammarlund, Catharina Sjödahl; Eek, Frida; Stigmar, Kjerstin; Lindgren, Ingrid; Schouenborg, Anna Trulsson; Hansson, Eva Ekvall",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207621/,211

Because the epidemic started later in Turkey than other European countries, it has the least number of deaths according to the current data. Outbreak management in COVID-19 is of great importance for public safety and public health. For this reason, prediction models can decide the precautionary warning to control the spread of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a forecasting model, considering statistical data for Turkey. Box-Jenkins Methods (ARIMA), Brown’s Exponential Smoothing model and RNN-LSTM are employed. ARIMA was selected with the lowest AIC values (12.0342, -2.51411, 12.0253, 3.67729, -4.24405, and 3.66077) as the best fit for the number of total case, the growth rate of total cases, the number of new cases, the number of total death, the growth rate of total deaths and the number of new deaths, respectively. The forecast values of the number of each indicator are stable over time. In the near future, it will not show an increasing trend in the number of cases for Turkey. In addition, the pandemic will become a steady state and an increase in mortality rates will not be expected between 17-31 May. ARIMA models can be used in fresh outbreak situations to ensure health and safety. It is vital to make quick and accurate decisions on the precautions for epidemic preparedness and management, so corrective and preventive actions can be updated considering obtained values.","Guleryuz, Didem",Process Saf Environ Prot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776248/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582021001464?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957582021001464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2021.03.032,211

The omics-based development of biomarkers and pharmaco-omics-based drug development programmes are evidences for the advancement. However, the field where it has proved to be most useful is in the development of various modalities of treatment in oncology. Various drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, tyrosine kinase receptor and rat sarcoma mutations have come to the forefront proving to be beneficial in many cancers. Some of the classic drugs developed using this concept include trastuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab among others. Precision medicine has been put to best use in the COVID-19 pandemic through use of various biomarkers such as IL-6 and c-reactive protein in assessing severity of disease, for development of various therapies and also to judge efficacy of vaccines. Precision medicine is also finding its place in management of infectious diseases, chronic diseases such as asthma, connective tissue diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity. India has also made its presence felt in the field by launching various initiatives such as the Indian genome project and Indian cancer genome atlas. Numerous challenges still exist to the future of precision medicine such as cost involved, ethics, security of the Big data, merger of various platforms to integrate data and also availability of trained manpower to manage the data and algorithms. This new age medicine is a big step forward for mankind and hopefully it will bring more benefits for both patients and the caregivers in the near future.","Naithani, Nardeep; Atal, Amar Tej; Tilak, T V S V G K; Vasudevan, Biju; Misra, Pratibha; Sinha, Sharmila","Medical journal, Armed Forces India",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305277/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.06.020,211

WHO recommends considering outbreak risk using epidemiological criteria when deciding whether to conduct preventive vaccination campaigns during the pandemic. METHODS: We used two to three models per infection to estimate the health impact of 50% reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 and delay of campaign vaccination from 2020 to 2021 for measles vaccination in Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Sudan, for meningococcal A vaccination in Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, and for yellow fever vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Our counterfactual comparative scenario was sustaining immunisation services at coverage projections made prior to COVID-19 (i.e. without any disruption). RESULTS: Reduced routine vaccination coverage in 2020 without catch-up vaccination may lead to an increase in measles and yellow fever disease burden in the modelled countries. Delaying planned campaigns in Ethiopia and Nigeria by a year may significantly increase the risk of measles outbreaks (both countries did complete their supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) planned for 2020). For yellow fever vaccination, delay in campaigns leads to a potential disease burden rise of >1 death per 100,000 people per year until the campaigns are implemented. For meningococcal A vaccination, short-term disruptions in 2020 are unlikely to have a significant impact due to the persistence of direct and indirect benefits from past introductory campaigns of the 1- to 29-year-old population, bolstered by inclusion of the vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule accompanied by further catch-up campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19-related disruption to vaccination programs varies between infections and countries. Planning and implementation of campaigns should consider country and infection-specific epidemiological factors and local immunity gaps worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic when prioritising vaccines and strategies for catch-up vaccination.

Since then, to prevent its propagation, the Moroccan government declared a state of health emergency. A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities, limiting population's mobility and prohibiting almost all avoidable activities. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM(10), NO(2) and SO(2)) in Salé city (North-Western Morocco) during the lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM(10), SO(2) and NO(2) was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the lockdown period were respectively 75%, 49% and 96% for PM(10), SO(2) and NO(2). PM(10) levels were much less reduced than NO(2). The three-dimensional air mass backward trajectories, using the HYSPLIT model, demonstrated the benefits of PM(10) local emission reductions related to the lockdown were overwhelmed by the contribution of long-range transported aerosols outside areas. In addition, noteworthy differences in the air mass back trajectories and the meteorology between these two periods were evidenced.","Otmani, Anas; Benchrif, Abdelfettah; Tahri, Mounia; Bounakhla, Moussa; Chakir, El Mahjoub; El Bouch, Mohammed; Krombi, M'hamed",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139541; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720330588?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445829/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720330588,211

The purpose of this study was to analyze gender differences associated with various hyperinflammatory conditions (HIC) and mortality in the Indian COVID-19 patients Methods: This study was conducted at the Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital (ELMCH), ERA University, which is located in the northern part of India. Starting from July 4, 2020 till December 3, 2020 a total of 2997 patients were treated at ELMCH. We randomly collected blood samples from 150 severe COVID-19 patients (required oxygen) between August 10 and September 15, 2020 for analyzing the following HIC and associated laboratory markers: hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin), hematological dysfunctions (lymphocytopenia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein), coagulopathy (D-dimer), liver inflammation (aspartate aminotransferase), renal inflammation (blood urea and creatinine), and hyperglycemia (random blood glucose). The threshold values/cut off limits of these laboratory markers used for analyzing the risk of mortality in male and female COVID-19 patients were set according to the scale validated recently by Webb et al, (2020). Results: In the above cohort of consecutively admitted COVID-19 patients, analysis of various HIC revealed hyperferritinaemia (odd ratio: 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0), hematological dysfunctions (odd ratio: 2.10, 95% CI 1.0-4.2), hepatic inflammation (odd ratio: 2.0, 95% CI 0.52-7.40), and coagulopathy (odd ratio: 1.5, 95% CI 1.50, 95% CI 0.50-4.60) were more prevalent and sever in male COVID-19 patients. Approximately 86% male to 64% female COVID-19 patients developed lymphocytopenia. Regarding mortality, while hyperferritinaemia (odd ratio: 1.70, 95% CI 0.37-7.43) and cytokinaemia (odd ratio: 1.60, 95% CI 0.37 -7.30) were strongly associated with mortality in male COVID-19 patients, coagulopathy (odd ratio: 3.30, 95% CI 0.31-35), and hematological dysfunctions (odd ratio: 1.70, 95% CI 0.27-10) were more commonly associated with mortality in female COVID-19 patients. Nearly 80% male and female COVID-19 patients, who died had developed [≥]2 criteria of HIS criteria. Chronic renal disease was associated with more deaths in female than male COVID-19 patients (odd ratio: 2.0, 95% CI 0.54 - 7.4). While the mortality proportion was slightly higher in male (6.3%) than female (4.5%) COVID-19 patients, survival curves of the two genders were not different (hazard ratio: 1.02, 95% CI 0.71-1.40, P = 0. 953). Conclusion: Distinct HIC were associated with the severity, and mortality in male and female COVID-19 patients. Coagulopathy and renal injury were detrimental, specifically, for female COVID-19 patients. The overall mortality proportion was around 5.3%. The above results suggest that gender differences associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality arise due to differences in various HIC. These results may help in developing personalized or gender based treatments for COVID-19 patients.

679032,Quality of primary health care in China: challenges and recommendations,2020-06-04,"Food insecurity increases with human and natural disasters. Two tools were developed to assist effective food relief in Western Australia: the Food Stress Index (similar to rental stress, predicts the likelihood of household food insecurity by geographic location) and a basic and nutritious Food Basket Recommendation (that quantifies the types and amounts of food to meet dietary recommendations for different family types). This study aims to understand and compare the processes and impact of using these tools for organisations and their clients involved in emergency food assistance and/or disaster preparedness. A multiple case-study design analysed organisation’s use of the tools to assist the response to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and the catastrophic bushfires in Australia. Qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone and Zoom (a cloud-based video conferencing service) in July–August 2020. A purposeful sample of eight interviewees representing seven cases (government, food relief and community organisations involved in emergency food assistance and/or disaster preparedness). Three themes emerged from the analysis, (1) organisations are confident users of the tools; (2) Collaborations were “Ready to Go” and (3) Food Stress Index is a “game changer”. Findings demonstrate the intrinsic value of the tools in the provision of emergency food relief under both normal circumstances and in times of increased need, i.e., COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlights the value and importance of ongoing intersectoral collaborations for food relief and food security (e.g., the Western Australian Food Relief Framework) and suggests that upscaling of the Food Stress Index and food baskets will increase the effectiveness of measures to address food insecurity in Australia.","Pollard, Christina Mary; Landrigan, Timothy John; Gray, Jennie Margaret; McDonald, Lockie; Creed, Helen; Booth, Sue",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209708/,211

Retrospective reviews have described pneumopericardium as a complication of laparoscopic surgery, however, without any symptoms. By this report, we present a case who developed acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy because of pneumopericardium. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Vietnamese woman was admitted due to left flank pain. She was diagnosed with left dysfunctional hydronephrosis and right urolithiasis. Six hours post-operation of an elective retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, she suddenly developed severe substernal chest pain and dyspnea. Evaluations for acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism were immediately ordered with no abnormality. However, computed tomography scan of the chest showed pneumopericardium, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, gas collection in sub-peritoneal space and next to the aortic arch. She was then closely monitored and effectively managed by conservative treatments. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Pneumopericardium is a rare complication of laparoscopy and mainly detected by radiographical measures incidentally. Several case studies reported symptomatic pneumopericardium, as in our presenting case. Some factors might contribute to the mechanism of our case that include retroperitoneal approach, thoroughly dissection the renal helium area and long-lasting operation. Post-operative collection of carbon dioxide is well self-limited; therefore, conservative treatments are efficient for stable cases. CONCLUSION: Pneumopericardium following laparoscopy is uncommon, and mostly subclinical. However, it can manifest as acute cardiopulmonary symptoms and signs that require carefully evaluation. The presence of gas in pericardial space is a negative prognosis factor itself; consequently, clinicians should be aware of when managing pneumopericardium subsequent to laparoscopic procedures.","Ngo, Trung Kien; Le, Duy Binh; Bui, Hoang Thao; Pham, Van Khiet",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33508612/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.01.059,211

Family units with fewer economic resources living in social dwellings could suffer from fuel poverty if they want to use air conditioning systems. Otherwise, they could face discomfort hours because of a natural ventilation without clear control criteria. This study analyses quantitatively and qualitatively the possibilities of natural ventilation through mixed-mode and the possibility of reducing fuel poverty for family units living in social dwellings. For this purpose, the application of a natural ventilation approach was analysed through an adaptive behaviour based on EN 16798-1: 2019. A case study of 51 social dwellings was analysed by using various operation hypothesis between 2015 and 2019. The results showed the potential of using mixed-mode approaches based on the categories from EN 16798-1:2019 to achieve savings in the energy consumption and to remove cases of fuel poverty in low-income families. Likewise, surveys in which families living in these cities participated reflected the great awareness of the natural ventilation use, although there is not a clear criterion of the need of this ventilation for thermal comfort, as well as the need of a supportive use of air conditioning systems. Finally, the similarity of the climate conditions of the city analysed and the coastal cities from various countries in the south of Europe shows the possibility of using ventilation strategies as energy saving measures in other regions.","Bienvenido-Huertas, David; Sánchez-García, Daniel; Rubio-Bellido, Carlos",Appl Energy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261920313222; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920313222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952267/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115845,211

Non-attendance rates are high, not least because of the challenges of attending hospital OPAs due to transport difficulties, cost, poor health, caring and work responsibilities. Digital solutions may help ameliorate these challenges. This project aimed to implement codesigned outpatient video consultations across National Health Service (NHS) Highland using system-wide quality improvement approaches to implementation, involving patients, carers, clinical and non-clinical staff, national and local strategic leads. System mapping; an intensive codesign process involving extensive stakeholder engagement and real-time testing; Plan, Do, Study, Act cycles; and collection of clinician and patient feedback were used to optimise the service. Standardised processes were developed and implemented, which made video consulting easy to use for patients, embedded video into routine health service systems for clinicians and non-clinical staff, and automated much of the administrative burden. All clinicians and staff are using the system and both groups identified benefits in terms of travel time and costs saved. Transferable lessons for other services are identified, providing a practical blueprint for others to adapt and use in their own contexts to help implement and sustain video consultation services now and in the future.","Morrison, Clare; Beattie, Michelle; Wherton, Joseph; Stark, Cameron; Anderson, Julie; Hunter-Rowe, Carolyn; Gray, Nicola M",BMJ Open Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33674346/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001259,211

This may have led to a decreased presentation to hospital of patients with acute medical conditions and time-dependent management, such as stroke. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study using administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral hemorrhage. Data from a total of 1463 hospitals in Germany were included. We compared case numbers and treatment characteristics of pandemic (March 16 to May 15, 2020) and prepandemic (January 16 to March 15, 2020) cases and also with corresponding time period in 2019. RESULTS: We identified a strong decline for hospitalization of AIS (−17.4%), transient ischemic attack (−22.9%), and intracerebral hemorrhage (−15.8%) patients during the pandemic compared with prepandemic period. IVT rate in patients with AIS was comparable (prepandemic versus pandemic: 16.4% versus 16.6%, P=0.448), whereas mechanical thrombectomy rate was significantly higher during the pandemic (8.1% versus 7.7%, P=0.044). In-hospital mortality was significantly increased in patients with AIS during the pandemic period (8.1% versus 7.6%, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Besides a massive decrease in absolute case numbers, our data suggest that patients with AIS who did seek acute care during the pandemic, continued to receive acute recanalization treatment in Germany.","Richter, Daniel; Eyding, Jens; Weber, Ralph; Bartig, Dirk; Grau, Armin; Hacke, Werner; Krogias, Christos",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.033160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356382/,211

Methods: To explore what contributes to the high COVID-19 mortality in Mexican middle-aged adults, we calculated age-stratified COVID-19 case fatality rates, YLL and relative risk (RR) of 9 comorbidities and 23 comorbidity combinations in a retrospective Mexican cohort with 905,579 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases/89,167 deaths, until Nov/2/2020. Findings: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) had the highest RR for COVID-19 fatality, followed by diabetes and immunosuppression, that in turn had higher RR than obesity or hypertension as single comorbidities. The combination diabetes/hypertension with or without obesity had RR as high as CKD as a single comorbidity (>3 in <60-year-olds). Notably, the RR of comorbidities decreased with age, tending to values near 1 after age 60; suggesting that in Mexico, comorbidities increase COVID-19 fatality mostly in young and middle-aged adults. Our analysis suggests that advanced metabolic disease, marked by multimorbidity (more than one chronic disease per individual) or diabetes before age 60, contribute particularly to the younger age of COVID-19 fatalities in Mexico. Around 38% of YLL to COVID-19, were attributable to the synergy between COVID-19 and pre-existing diseases, mainly combinations between obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Yet, 1/4 of deaths and 1/3 of YLL have occurred in individuals without known comorbidities. Conclusions: The Mexican COVID-19 outbreak illustrates that middle-aged adults 45-64-yo can have high COVID-19 mortality during large outbreaks, especially if they present chronic metabolic comorbidities, but also in their absence, making them an important group of concern after elders. COVID-19 mortality in middle-aged adults is likely proportional to the gradual decline in health that accompanies ageing, which presents earlier in poorer populations that also get more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and have less access to specialized medical attention.","Dominguez-Ramirez, L.; Rodriguez-Perez, F.; Sosa-Jurado, F.; Santos-Lopez, G.; Cortes-Hernandez, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20244160v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.20244160,211

Earlier, we reported that a toll-like-receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, resiquimod (R-848), stimulated the systemic immunity when adjuvanted with the inactivated Newcastle disease virus vaccine in the chicken. Here, we report the effect of R-848 when adjuvanted with live or inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccines with special emphasis on mucosal immunity. Specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks (n = 60) were equally divided into six groups at two weeks of age and immunized with either inactivated or live IBV vaccine adjuvanted with or without R-848. Groups that received either PBS or R-848 served as control. A booster was given on 14 days post-immunization (dpi). R-848 enhanced the antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses when co-administered with the vaccines as evidenced by an increase in the antibody titre in ELISA and stimulation index in lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) till 35 dpi and increased proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells on 21 dpi in the flow cytometry. Interestingly, it potentiated the IgA responses in the tear and intestinal secretions when used with both live and inactivated IBV vaccines. The combination of IBV vaccine with R-848 significantly up-regulated the transforming growth factor beta 4 (TGFβ4) transcripts in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than that of the respective vaccine per se. An enhanced secretory IgA response is likely due to the up-regulation of TGFβ4, which is responsible for class switching to IgA. In conclusion, co-administration of R-848 with inactivated or live IBV vaccine enhanced the systemic as well as mucosal immune responses in the chicken.","Matoo, Javaid Jeelani; Bashir, Khalid; Kumar, Ajay; Krishnaswamy, Narayanan; Dey, Sohini; Chellappa, Madhan Mohan; Ramakrishnan, Saravanan",Microb Pathog,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401018302948; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29635053/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401018302948,211

Serological tests monitored across the course of the second wave can provide insights into the population-level prevalence and dynamic patterns of COVID-19 infection. Objective: To assess changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees working in Tokyo during the second wave. Design: We conducted an observational cohort study. Healthy volunteers working for a Japanese company in Tokyo were enrolled from disparate locations to determine seropositivity against COVID19 from May 26 to August 25, 2020. COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined by a rapid COVID19 IgM/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. Across the company, tests were performed and acquired weekly. For each participant, serology tests were offered twice, separated by approximately a month, to provide self-reference of test results and to assess for seroconversion and seroreversion. Setting: Workplace setting within a large company. Participants: Healthy volunteers from 1877 employees of a large Japanese company were recruited to the study from 11 disparate locations across Tokyo. Participants having fever, cough, or shortness of breath at the time of testing were excluded. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Seropositivity rate (SPR) was calculated by pooled data from each two-weeks window across the cohort. Either IgM or IgG positivity was defined as seropositive. Changes in immunological status against SARS-CoV-2 were determined by comparing results between two tests obtained from the same individual. Results: Six hundred fifteen healthy volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0; range 19-69; 45.7 % female) received at least one test. Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over the course of the summer. The most dramatic increase in SPR occurred in late June and early July, paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo, which peaked on August 4. Out of the 350 individuals (mean + SD 42.5 + 10.0; range 19-69; 46.0 % female) who completed both offered tests, 21.4 % of those individuals who tested seronegative became seropositive and seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants. 81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo despite the very low fatality rate. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases that occurred without a shut-down, herd immunity may be implicated. Sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population-level.","Hibino, S.; Hayashida, K.; Ahn, A.

Studies demonstrate a survival advantage in obese patients with HF, including those with advanced HF requiring continuous inotropic support for palliation or disease modifying therapy with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT). Importantly, the obesity paradox is affected by the level of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). It is now recommended that HF patients with body mass index ≥35 kg/m(2) achieve at least 5–10% weight loss, in order to improve symptoms and cardiac function, though more robust data are urgently needed. CRF may be the single best predictor of overall health and small improvements in fitness levels may lead to improved outcomes in HF. In addition to implications of obesity in chronic HF, we also discuss management of obese patients with advanced HF and their implications for therapies such as LVAD implantation and HT.","Elagizi, Andrew; Carbone, Salvatore; Lavie, Carl J.; Mehra, Mandeep R.; Ventura, Hector O.",Prog Cardiovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33002458/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2020.09.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033062020301614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062020301614?v=s5,211

We highlight a Cochrane review of qualitative evidence that explored barriers and facilitators to HCW compliance with IPC recommendations for COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases. The review found various individual- and organizational- level barriers and facilitators. The findings suggest that healthcare system constraints that make it difficult for healthcare workers to implement IPC guidelines require urgent prioritisation. This will help lay the foundation for addressing the more individual-level barriers potentially discouraging HCW from implementing IPC guidelines. We draw attention to pan-African initiatives for enhancing healthcare workers’ capacity to undertake IPC measures at such a critical time.","Cooper, Sara; Wiyeh, Alison; Schmidt, Bey-Marrié; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.2.23012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623548/,211

Not only are people’s lives and livelihoods affected, but the virus has also affected people’s lifestyles. In the research sector, there have been significant changes, and new research is coming very strongly in the related fields of virology and epidemiology. Similar trends were observed after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) episodes of 2003 and 2012, respectively. Analyzing 20 years of published scientific papers, this article points out the highlights of coronavirus-related research. Significant progress is observed in the past research related to virology, epidemiology, infectious diseases among others. However, in research linked to public health, its governance, technology, and risk communication there seem to be gap areas. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) global research road map has identified social science-related research as a priority area, more focus needs to be given in the upcoming days for multi, cross and trans-disciplinary research related to public health and disaster risk reduction.","Zhang, Hongyue; Shaw, Rajib",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408679/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103370,211

690258,Predicting Health Disparities in Regions at Risk of Severe Illness to inform Healthcare Resource Allocations during Pandemics,2020-07-08,"A non-toxic, nine residue peptide, NIVNVSLVK is shown to interfere with insulin fibrillation by various biophysical methods. Insulin undergoes conformational changes under certain stress conditions leading to amyloid fibrils. Fibrillation of insulin poses a problem in its long-term storage, reducing its efficacy in treating type II diabetes. The dissociation of insulin oligomer to monomer is the key step for the onset of fibrillation. The time course of insulin fibrillation at 62°C using Thioflavin T fluorescence shows an increase in the lag time from 120 min without peptide to 236 min with peptide. Transmission electron micrographs show branched insulin fibrils in its absence and less inter-fibril association in its presence. Upon incubation at 62°C and pH 2.6, insulin lost some α-helical structure as seen by Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), but if the peptide is added, secondary structure is almost fully maintained for 3 h, though lost partially at 4 h. FT-IR spectroscopy also shows that insulin forms the cross beta structure indicative of fibrils beyond 2 h, but in the presence of the peptide, α-helix retention is seen till 4 h. Both size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering show that insulin primarily exists as trimer, whose conversion to a monomer is resisted by the peptide. Saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance confirms that the hydrophobic residues in the peptide are in close contact with an insulin hydrophobic groove. Molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with principal component analyses reveal how the peptide interrupts insulin fibrillation. In vitro hemolytic activity of the peptide showed insignificant cytotoxicity against HT1080 cells. The insulin aggregation is probed due to the inter play of two key residues, Phe(B24) and Tyr(B26) monitored from molecular dynamics simulations studies. Further new peptide based leads may be developed from this nine residue peptide.","Banerjee, Victor; Kar, Rajiv K.; Datta, Aritreyee; Parthasarathi, Krupakar; Chatterjee, Subhrangsu; Das, Kali P.; Bhunia, Anirban",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24009675/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072318,211

In line with the stated intent of TCJA proponents, we find that the Act benefited highly taxed firms. However, the Act hindered firms with international operations as well as firms with high interest expense and tax losses. Counter to claims that the TCJA would quickly spur economic growth, we find that financially constrained and high growth opportunity firms did not benefit. Rather, market participants anticipate that most of the TCJA's benefits will be passed on to shareholders via higher corporate payouts. We confirm these market expectations by documenting that firms did increase payouts via repurchases after the TCJA, but did not increase their corporate investments.","Kalcheva, Iva; Plečnik, James M.; Tran, Hai; Turkiela, Jason",J Bank Financ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426620301266?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2020.105860; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378426620301266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32562471/,211
