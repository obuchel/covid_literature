10088,10088,10088,The accuracy of nurses' estimates of their absenteeism,18.255728,4.996437,2010-07-12,"AIM: Species distributions are one of the most important ways to understand how communities interact through macroecological relationships. The functional abilities of a species, such as its plasticity in various environments, can determine its distribution, species richness and beta diversity patterns. In this study, we evaluate how functional traits influence the distribution of amphibians, and hypothesize which functional traits explain the current pattern of amphibian species composition. LOCATION: Atlantic Forest, Brazil. TAXON: Amphibia (Anura and Gymnophiona) METHODS: Using potential distributions of Brazilian amphibians from Atlantic Forest based on their functional traits, we analysed the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on species richness, endemism (with permutation multivariate analysis) and beta diversity components (i.e. total, turnover and nestedness dissimilarities). RESULTS: Environmental variables explained 59.5% of species richness, whereas functional traits explained 15.8% of species distribution (geographical species range) for Anuran and 88.8% for Gymnophiona. Body size had the strongest correlation with species distribution. Results showed that species with medium to large body size, and species that are adapted to living in open areas tended to disperse from west to east direction. Current forest changes directly affected beta diversity patterns (i.e. most species adapted to novel environments increase their ranges). Beta diversity partitioning between humid and dry forests showed decreased nestedness and increased turnover by increasing altitude in the south‐eastern region of the Atlantic Forest. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that functional traits directly influence the ability of the species to disperse. With the alterations of the natural environment, species more apt to these alterations have dispersed or increased their distribution, which consequently changes community structure. As a result, there are nested species distribution patterns and homogenization of amphibian species composition throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.","Lourenço‐de‐Moraes, Ricardo; Campos, Felipe S.; Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Beard, Karen H.; Solé, Mirco; Llorente, Gustavo A.; Bastos, Rogério P.",J Biogeogr,473,1

We selected glycoprotein C (gC) of BoHV-1 as a target to detect and/or verify presence of the virus in suspect materials followed by virus isolation (VI) in MDBK cells. In seven out of 13 BoHV-1 positive samples, cytophatic effects (CPEs) were observed in MDBK cell cultures, although only four virus samples reached a sufficient titer to use in phylogenetic assay, restriction endonuclease analysis (REA), and virus neutralization test (VNT). According to the results of sequence analysis of the 13 BoHV-1 positive samples, nine BoHV-1 field viruses were determined as BoHV-1.1 and four as BoHV-1.2. Using REA, we demonstrated that two of our isolated viruses could be categorized as BoHV-1.1 while the other two isolates were BoHV-1.2 subtypes. Differences between the BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2 isolates were also detected in the VNT results by assaying 125 suspected serum samples after testing with isolated (KY748023, KY748022, KY748020, and KY748021) and reference viruses (BoHV-1 Cooper and BoHV-5 Texas 89). These results are indicating the need to correctly identify BoHV-1 field isolates to better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of infection. In addition, it would be useful to identify the subtypes circulating in the specific geographical area while determining vaccination preferences.","Dagalp, Seval Bilge; Farzani, Touraj Aligholipour; Dogan, Firat; Alkan, Feray; Ozkul, Aykut",Trop Anim Health Prod,473,22
11633,11633,11633,Corrigendum,18.48388,4.9260464,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever incidence and complications, including intestinal perforation, have declined significantly in high-income countries, with mortality rates <1%. However, an estimated 10.9 million cases still occur annually, most in low- and middle-income countries. With the availability of a new typhoid conjugate vaccine licensed for children and recommended by the World Health Organization, understanding severe complications, including associated mortality rates, is essential to inform country-level decisions on introduction of this vaccine. This scoping review summarizes over 20 years of the literature on typhoid intestinal perforation in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases for studies reporting mortality rates due to typhoid intestinal perforation in children, under 18 years old, in sub-Saharan Africa published from January 1995 through June 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers from six countries were included. Reported mortality rates ranged from 4.6–75%, with 16 of the 24 studies between 11 and 30%. Thirteen papers included postoperative morbidity rates, ranging from 16–100%. The most documented complications included surgical site infections, intra-abdominal abscesses, and enterocutaneous fistulas. High mortality rates can be attributed to late presentation to tertiary centers, sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities requiring preoperative resuscitation, prolonged perforation-to-surgery interval, and lack of access to critical care or an intensive care unit postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Current estimates of mortality related to typhoid intestinal perforation among children in sub-Saharan Africa remain unacceptably high. Prevention of typhoid fever is essential to reduce mortality, with the ultimate goal of a comprehensive approach that utilizes vaccination, improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene, and greater access to surgical care.

14343,14343,14343,The Pathways between Cortisol-Related Regulation Genes and PTSD Psychotherapy,18.390968,4.662268,2020-10-01,"Due to the low efficacy and the need for seasonal adaptation of currently licensed influenza A vaccines, the importance of alternative vaccination strategies is increasingly recognized. Considering that DNA vaccines can be rapidly manufactured and readily adapted with novel antigen sequences, genetic vaccination is a promising immunization platform. However, the applicability of different genetic adjuvants to this approach still represents a complex challenge. Immune checkpoints are a class of molecules involved in adaptive immune responses and germinal center reactions. In this study, we immunized mice by intramuscular electroporation with a DNA-vaccine encoding hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) of the influenza A virus. The DNA-vaccine was applied either alone or in combination with genetic adjuvants encoding the soluble ectodomains of programmed cell death protein-1 (sPD-1) or its ligand (sPD-L1). Co-administration of genetic checkpoint adjuvants did not significantly alter immune responses against NP. In contrast, sPD-1 co-electroporation elevated HA-specific CD4(+) T cell responses, decreased regulatory CD4(+) T cell pools, and modulated the IgG2a-biased HA antibody pattern towards an isotype-balanced IgG response with a trend to higher influenza neutralization in vitro. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a genetic DNA-adjuvant encoding soluble ectodomains of sPD-1 was able to modulate immune responses induced by a co-administered influenza DNA vaccine.","Tannig, Pierre; Peter, Antonia Sophia; Lapuente, Dennis; Klessing, Stephan; Schmidt, Anna; Damm, Dominik; Tenbusch, Matthias; Überla, Klaus; Temchura, Vladimir",Vaccines (Basel),473,1

This immunotoxin, 6D8-PE38, bound specifically to cells expressing EBOV glycoproteins. Importantly, 6D8-PE38 targeted EBOV-infected cells, as evidenced by inhibition of infectious EBOV production from infected cells, including primary human macrophages.

We report the synthesis and scale-up of triangular silver nanoplates (TSNPs) and their integration into polycaprolactone (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLA) polymers through a solvent-casting technique. The TSNPs have a high geometric aspect ratio and strong local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) response, which provides an effective tool for monitoring their integrity during processing and integration with the biodegradable plastics. An aqueous-based seed-mediated chemical method was used to synthesize the TSNPs, and characterisation was carried out using TEM and UV (Ultraviolet)-VIS (Visible) spectroscopy to measure LSPR profiles. The UV-VIS spectra of silver seeds and TSNPs exhibited characteristic peaks at 395 and 600 nm respectively. Synthesized TSNPs were coated with thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG) and transferred into chloroform in order to effect compatibility with PCL and PLA. TSNP/PCL and TSNP/PLA composite films were prepared by solvent casting. The morphological structure, thermal, mechanical, and antimicrobial properties of the TSNP-incorporated composite films were evaluated. Results showed the TSNP-treated films had a rougher surface than the bare films. Insignificant changes in the thermal properties of TSNP-treated films compared to bare ones were also observed, which indicated the thermal stability of the composite films. The tensile strength and antimicrobial properties of the composite films were increased after TSNP incorporation. TSNP/PCL and TSNP/PLA films exhibited improved antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with antimicrobial effect (AE) values ranging between 0.10 and 0.35. The obtained results and demonstrated TSNP production scalability validate the TSNP treated PCL and PLA films as a composite material with desirable antimicrobial effect for wide-ranging surface applications.","Garcia, Eduardo Lanzagorta; Attallah, Olivia A.; Mojicevic, Marija; Devine, Declan M; Brennan Fournet, Margaret",Materials (Basel),473,22

Today, in the age of cheap information—cheap to produce, to manipulate, to disseminate—this cognitive bottleneck translates into hypercompetition for rewarding outcomes among actors. These incentives push actors to mutualistically interact with specific memes, seeking the virality of their messages. In turn, memes’ chances to persist and spread are subject to changes in the communication environment. In spite of all this complexity, here we show that the underlying architecture of empirical actor-meme information ecosystems evolves into recurring emergent patterns. We then propose an ecology-inspired modelling framework, bringing to light the precise mechanisms causing the observed flexible structural reorganisation. The model predicts—and the data confirm—that users’ struggle for visibility induces a re-equilibration of the network’s mesoscale towards self-similar nested arrangements. Our final microscale insights suggest that flexibility at the structural level is not mirrored at the dynamical one.","Palazzi, María J.; Solé-Ribalta, Albert; Calleja-Solanas, Violeta; Meloni, Sandro; Plata, Carlos A.; Suweis, Samir; Borge-Holthoefer, Javier",Nat Commun,473,1

Research shows that informational counselling provided by audiologists is limited and often biased, with little evidence of how parents experience this service. OBJECTIVES: To explore the nature and practice of informational counselling by audiologists. METHOD: This study was descriptive in nature and adopted a survey design to obtain information on the current practices of informational counselling from the perspective of parents and primary caregivers. Ninety-seven face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted across KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis using Nvivo software were conducted. RESULTS: The majority of the parents reported receiving some form of informational counselling. However, the information provided by audiologists was considered to be biased as it included a favoured communication option, school and rehabilitative technology. There was a lack of information related to aural rehabilitation and family-centred intervention. The provision of all communication options, school options and rehabilitative technology were identified as gaps that contribute to an unfavourable decision-making process. CONCLUSION: There are inefficiencies experienced by families of deaf and hard of hearing children during informational counselling. However, this understanding, together with the identified gaps by parents, can help address the professional response to caring for families with deaf and hard of hearing children.","Shezi, Zandile M.; Joseph, Lavanithum N.",S Afr J Commun Disord,473,1

The disease was caused by an unknown animal coronavirus (CoV) that had crossed the species barrier through close contact of humans with infected animals, and was identified as the etiological agent for SARS. This new CoV not only became readily transmissible between humans but also was also more pathogenic. The disease spread across the world rapidly due to the air travel, and infected 8096 people and caused 774 deaths in 26 countries on 5 continents. The disease is characterized by flu-like symptoms, including high fever, malaise, cough, diarrhea, and infiltrates visible on chest radiography. The overall mortality was about 10%, but varied profoundly with age; the course of disease seemed to be milder in the pediatric age group and resulted rarely in a fatal outcome, but the mortality in the elderly was as high as 50%. Aggressive quarantine measures taken by the health authorities have successfully contained and terminated the disease transmission. As a result there are no SARS cases recorded recently. Nevertheless there is a possibility that the disease may emerge in the population with high vigor. Significant progress has been made in understanding the disease biology, pathogenesis, development of animal models, and design and evaluation of different vaccines, and these are the focus of this chapter.","Srivastava, Indresh K.; Kan, Elaine; Srivastava, Isha N.; Cisto, Jimna; Biron, Zohar",Immunity Against Mucosal Pathogens,473,19

In this paper, we introduce two types of case-sensitive neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to alleviate the above problems: i) adding case tokens into the decoding sequence, and ii) adopting case prediction to the conventional NMT. Our proposed approaches incorporate case information to the NMT decoder by jointly learning target word generation and word case prediction. We compare our approaches with multiple kinds of baselines including NMT with naive case-restoration methods and analyze the impacts of various setups on our approaches. Experimental results on three typical translation tasks (Zh-En, En-Fr, En-De) show that our proposed methods lead to the improvements up to 2.5, 1.0 and 0.5 in case-sensitive BLEU scores respectively. Further analyses also illustrate the inherent reasons why our approaches lead to different improvements on different translation tasks.","Shi, Xuewen; Huang, Heyan; Jian, Ping; Tang, Yi-Kun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,473,10

Autophagy has been found involved in the lipid metabolism regulation through a bi-directional mechanism of inducing lipolysis as well as promoting lipid droplet formation. However, whether and how autophagy influences lipid accumulation in kidney fibrosis remain unclear. In the current study, we show that UUO-induced lipid accumulation in tubular cells was significantly reduced when the pharmacological inhibitor 3-MA or CQ was administrated both in vivo and in vitro. Of interest, colocalization of LDs and autophagosomes, as well as colocalization of LDs and lysosomes were undetected in UUO-induced fibrotic kidneys, although lysosome function remained robust, indicating the lipid accumulation is lipophagy-lysosome pathway independent. TGF-β1-induced lipid droplets formation in HK-2 cells were decreased when the Beclin-1 expression was silenced, implying that autophagy-upregulated lipid droplets formation is Beclin-1 dependent. Finally, CQ treatment of UUO-induced fibrotic kidneys reduced the expression of α-SMA and tubular cell apoptosis and rescued the expression of E-cadherin, which was associated with the ameliorated lipid deposition. Therefore, our work documented that autophagy promotes lipid droplet formation in TECs in a Beclin-1-dependent manner, which causes renal lipotoxicity and contributes to the progression of kidney fibrosis.","Yan, Qi; Song, Yuan; Zhang, Lu; Chen, Zhaowei; Yang, Cheng; Liu, Shan; Yuan, Xiaohan; Gao, Hongyu; Ding, Guohua; Wang, Huiming",Cell Death Discov,473,1

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends education and training to improve HH knowledge and compliance. Physicians are ranked among the worst of all healthcare workers for compliant handrubbing with its origin probably being the failure to learn this essential behavior during undergraduate medical studies. This study evaluated if the use of Ultraviolet-cabinets (UVc) for fluorescent-alcohol-based handrubs (AHR) during an undergraduate medical student training improved the compliance rate to the WHO hand hygiene recommendations (completeness of AHR application and HH opportunities). METHODS: This randomized trial compared a HH training with personal feedback (using UVc) to a control group. The first year, the students (2nd degree) were convened by groups (clusters) of 6–9 for a demonstration of the correct execution of WHO procedure. Randomization by cluster was done prior HH training. In the control group, the students hand rubbed under visual supervision of a tutor. In the intervention group after the same visual supervision, completeness of fluorescent-AHR hand application was recorded under UVc and was shown to the student. The intervention group had free access to the UVc until complete application. HH practices were included in simulation sessions for the both groups. One year after (3rd degree), all the students were asked to hand rub with fluorescent-AHR. A tutor (blinded to the study group) assessed the completeness of hand application under UVc and the compliance with the WHO opportunities. Complete application of AHR was defined as fluorescence for all the surfaces of hands and wrists. RESULTS: 242 students participated (140 in the intervention group and 102 in the control group). One year after the initial training, the rate of complete application of AHR was doubled in the intervention group (60.0% vs. 30.4%, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis which included gender, additional HH or UVc training, surgical traineeship and regular use of AHR, the hazard ratio for the intervention was 3.84 (95%CI: 2.09–7.06). The compliance with the HH WHO’s opportunities was increased in the intervention group (58.1% vs. 42.4%, p < 0.018).

In an option contract, the shipping company commits to order a quantity of containers from the leasing company and has the right to modify its order at a later stage, according to its actual requirement. Under this scheme, the shipping company is allowed to request a smaller or larger number of containers than the agreed initial order. This is done by buying an option premium in advance from the container leasing company. We present numerical results for different scenarios based on information provided by experts in the industry. For the purposes of comparison, a nonoption contract scheme is also evaluated. According to our numerical results, an option contract is better under a scenario where demand is normally distributed with a large standard deviation. This scenario is commonly observed in practice due to the dynamism and volatility of the shipping industry. We conclude that, under an option contract scheme, the shipping company has more flexibility to adjust its demand for containers and to be requested from the leasing company, and this adjustment is compensated by an option price determined according to variations in demand.","Gómez-Padilla, Alejandra; González-Ramírez, Rosa G.; Alarcón, Fernando; Voß, Stefan",Marit Econ Logist,473,17

However, whether a limited FTP functions similarly in younger and older adults, and whether inter-individual differences in socioemotional functioning are similarly associated with preference for positive information (i.e., positivity) is still not clear. We investigated younger (20–35 years, N = 73) and older (60–75 years, N = 56) adults’ gaze preferences on pairs of happy, angry, sad, and neutral faces using an eye-tracking system. We additionally assessed several parameters potentially underlying inter-individual differences in emotion processing such as FTP, stress, cognitive functioning, social support, emotion regulation, and well-being. While we found no age-related differences in positivity when the entire trial duration was considered, older adults showed longer fixations on the more positive face in later stages of processing (i.e., positivity shifts). This allocation of resources toward more positive stimuli might serve an emotion regulatory purpose and seems consistent with the SST. However, our findings suggest that age moderates the relationship between FTP and positivity shifts, such that the relationship between FTP and positivity preferences was negative in older, and positive in younger adults, potentially stemming from an age-related differential meaning of the FTP construct across age. Furthermore, our exploratory analyses showed that along with the age and FTP interaction, lower levels of worry also played a significant role in positivity shifts. We conclude that positivity effects cannot be solely explained by aging, or the associated reduced FTP per se, but is rather determined by a complex interplay of psychosocial and emotional features.","Erbey, Miray; Roebbig, Josefin; Babayan, Anahit; Kumral, Deniz; Reinelt, Janis; Reiter, Andrea M.

Multiple treatment options exist for older patients with GBM however, the assessment of older patients prior to treatment decisions is poorly researched and lacks standardization. In order to address this issue we performed a cross-sectional electronic survey distributed to all full members of the Society for Neuro-Oncology. There were 116 respondents from a total of 1515 recipients (8% response rate). The survey was distributed during the peak of COVID-19 which undoubtedly affected response rates. 97% of respondents were clinicians with 86% academic. 72% had been in practice > 10 years and the majority saw 5–10 new GBM cases per month. 95% of respondents were from the USA, with involvement from Japan, Australia, Canada and Italy. 37% of respondents routinely perform a cognitive or frailty screening test. Of these, MMSE and MoCA were the most commonly used. Of those who performed a screening test, the majority reported that the results changed their treatment decision in approximately 50% of cases. 50% of respondents have access to a multidisciplinary team during their clinic, with physical therapy being the most available. When making treatment decisions, participants ranked performance status as the most important clinical factor. Considering the heterogeneity of this patient population, we argue that performance status is a crude measure of vulnerability within this cohort. In the first survey of this kind, we have shown a disparity in assessment techniques across the international neuro-oncology field and the impact performing a cognitive screen has on decision making. Older patients with GBM represent a unique clinical scenario because of the complexity of distinguishing neuro- oncology related symptoms from general frailty. There is a need for specific geriatric assessment models tailored to the older neuro-oncology population in order to facilitate treatment decisions.","Lorimer, Cressida; Chalmers, Anthony; Johnson, Margaret; Brock, Juliet",Neuro Oncol,473,1

It is argued that anthropogenic alterations in the biosphere will most likely accelerate the rate of multispecies pandemics in the Anthropocene. Using a textual analysis approach of anthropological and historical sources on the example of coronaviruses and live animal markets in China, we trace how the virosphere of wild animals from tropical regions comes into contact with the virosphere of humans and farmed animals in highly industrialized landscapes. We suggest that adopting a multispecies perspective on viruses can allow them to be understood as living processes that interact with other species in a realm called the virosphere. The rate at which novel infectious diseases are transmitted by bacteria and viruses has increased in recent decades. We argue that this is caused by side effects of the Anthropocene, such as deforestation, the surge in population growth and density, and anthropogenic climate change, which give rise to an increased number of unusual encounters between humans, nonhuman companion species, and wild animals. In this way, the virospheres of host organisms, which were formerly partly isolated, are allowed to converge and freely exchange infectious diseases, leading to a more homogenized virosphere. As anthropogenic alterations are set to continue in the future, we suggest that multispecies pandemics will likely increase in the following decades.","Aronsson, Anne; Holm, Fynn",,473,1

Among pancreatic cancers, ductal adenocarcinomas are by far the most common, characterised by a challenging diagnosis due to the lack of initial and pathognomonic clinical signs. In this scenario, non-metastatic locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) accounts for a large proportion of all new pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma diagnoses. There is no consensus on a common definition of LAPC. Still, it usually includes tumours that are not resectable due to vascular involvement. As of today, treatment is limited, and the prognosis is very unfavourable. Curative-intent surgery remains the gold-standard even if often jeopardized by vascular involvement. Continuing progress in our understanding of LAPC genetics and immunology will permit the development of different treatments, targeted or combined, including radiation therapy, hadrontherapy, targeted immunotherapies or new chemotherapies. A multidisciplinary approach combining various fields of expertise is essential in aiming to limit disease progression as well as patient outcome. Using a narrative literature review approach, the manuscript explores the most up-to-date knowledge concerning locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma management.","Barcellini, Amelia; Peloso, Andrea; Pugliese, Luigi; Vitolo, Viviana; Cobianchi, Lorenzo",Onco Targets Ther,473,16

In 2020, completion of SL coincided with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We evaluated the impact of SL on student attitudes on aging and community service in the context of the pandemic. Methods: Students were assigned to senior residential and daycare programs for 18-20 hours of SL. A retrospective pretest-posttest survey asked about attitudes and interests before and after SL and how the COVID-19 pandemic affected these perceptions; 73 (of 103) students responded. Mean differences before and after SL were tested and differences were assessed within groups reporting COVID-19 effects. Results: SL improved students’ attitudes and ability to engage with older adults, knowledge about aging concepts, interest in future work with older adults, attitudes on community service, social well-being and feelings of usefulness (p<0.001). There was no significant change in overall anxiety about aging (p=0.1), however, students showed increased anxiety about losing independence and finances when older (p<0.05). At least 50% of students reported that the COVID-19 pandemic increased their awareness of needs of older adults (81.9%) and decreased connection to their peers (50.7%); the impact of SL remained unchanged by these effects. Conclusion: Despite the overall benefits of SL, increased anxiety about aspects of aging suggests the need to address these concerns. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to affect the impact of SL, this event did seem to influence perceptions about aging and social integration.","Merkin, Sharon",Innov Aging,473,16

In view of this historical event, the first part of this theoretical study discussed its relationship with the concept of crisis, while circumscribing human development processes, mobilizing reorganizations in life trajectories. In the second part, the intensification of the use of digital tools to support communication during social isolation was highlighted, particularly reflecting on new interactive arrangements and inter-corporeal experiences. The paper reflects on the proximal processes in the new interactive and contextual configurations through the bioecological theory of human development and, based on concepts of the enactive theory, discusses possible implications of the new perceptual fields and the production of meanings with the repositioning of the body and new modes of engagement.

The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) differentiates the severity of trauma and is the basis for different trauma scores and prediction models. While the majority of patients do not survive injuries which are coded with an AIS 6, there are several patients with a severe high cervical spinal cord injury that could be discharged from hospital despite the prognosis of trauma scores. We estimate that the trauma scores and prediction models miscalculate these injuries. For this reason, we evaluated these findings in a larger control group. METHODS: In a retrospective, multi-centre study, we used the data recorded in the TraumaRegister DGU® (TR-DGU) to select patients with a severe cervical spinal cord injury and an AIS of 3 to 6 between 2002 to 2015. We compared the estimated mortality rate according to the Revised Injury Severity Classification II (RISC II) score against the actual mortality rate for this group. RESULTS: Six hundred and twelve patients (0.6%) sustained a severe cervical spinal cord injury with an AIS of 6. The mean age was 57.8 ± 21.8 years and 441 (72.3%) were male. 580 (98.6%) suffered a blunt trauma, 301 patients were injured in a car accident and 29 through attempted suicide. Out of the 612 patients, 391 (63.9%) died from their injury and 170 during the first 24 h. The group had a predicted mortality rate of 81.4%, but we observed an actual mortality rate of 63.9%. CONCLUSIONS: An AIS of 6 with a complete cord syndrome above C3 as documented in the TR-DGU is survivable if patients get to the hospital alive, at which point they show a survival rate of more than 35%. Compared to the mortality prognosis based on the RISC II score, they survived much more often than expected.","Kamp, O.; Jansen, O.; Lefering, R.; Aach, M.; Waydhas, C.; Dudda, M.; Schildhauer, T.

Starting point is an observational diagnosis of present socio-political conditions, which have transformed crisis from a turning point into a continuation and radicalization of the existing order. In an attempt to understand the ongoing subversion of transformative potentials of crisis, a similar process of pacification and subversion of critique in dominant theoretical paradigms will be examined. It will be argued that both socio-political and main-stream theoretical processes work toward pacification of the status quo that raises both existential and theoretical concerns. In order to support the claim that a different relationship between crisis and critique is possible, it will be referred to Reinhart Koselleck’s seminal study, Critique and crisis (1959), where it is shown how absolutist state generated its critique by Enlightenment and then Enlightenment conditioned radical changes in form of French Revolution. Relying on that example, the following questions will be raised: What kind of historical structures have been lost since times which generated Enlightenment as a critical stance? What kind of theoretical tools are we missing in post-Enlightenment post-modern times in order to conceptualize and condition radical changes? What is the role of psychological theorizing in sustaining adaptation to the existing order instead of arguing and demanding its radical change?

In the simulation using EnergyPlus, an annual energy consumption of 442 MWh was obtained, that compares with 533 MWh when using Revit. Concerning the thermal loads in the sales area of the hypermarket, the simulation results for the thermal loads were the following: 761 kW for heating and 79 kW for cooling, versus 924 kW for heating and 86 kW for cooling when using the EnergyPlus and the Revit software, respectively. This discrepancy between the values obtained could be due to the limited selection of climatic files in Revit as well as the different definitions of the HVAC systems.","Silva, João; Brás, José; Noversa, Ricardo; Rodrigues, Nelson; Martins, Luís; Teixeira, José; Teixeira, Senhorinha",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,473,10

The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has, to date, been effectively contained in China, but the threat of imported cases and local risks still exist. The systematic identification of the virus’s path of influence and intensity is significant for economic recovery. This study is based on a refined multi-regional general equilibrium analysis model, which measures the economic and industrial impacts at different epidemic risk levels in China and simulates development trends and the degree of damage to industries and the economy under changes to supplies of production materials and product demand. The results show that, at the macroeconomic level, China’s GDP will decline about 0.4% to 0.8% compared to normal in 2020, with an average drop of about 2% in short-term consumption, an average drop in employment of about 0.7%, and an average increase in prices of about 0.9%. At the industry level, the epidemic will have the greatest short-term impact on consumer and laborintensive industries. For example, the output value of the service industry will fall 6.3% compared to normal. Looking at the impact of the epidemic on the industrial system, the province most affected by the epidemic is Hubei, which is the only province in China in the level-1 risk category. As the disease spread outward from Hubei, there were clear differences in the main industries that were impacted in different regions. In addition, simulation results of recovery intensity of regional economies under the two epidemic response scenarios of resumption of work and production and active fiscal stimulus policies show that an increase in fiscal stimulus policies produces a 0.3% higher rate of gross regional product growth but it causes commodity prices to rise by about 1.8%. Measures to resume work and production offer a wider scope for industrial recovery.","Wu, Feng; Liu, Guijun; Guo, Naliang; Li, Zhihui; Deng, Xiangzheng",J,473,5

We conducted a single-centre mixed method quality improvement project to assess the validity of a diagnostic algorithm for appendicitis and the diagnostic impact of increasing cross-sectional imaging during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHOD: Adult histology reports and preoperative imaging data were retrospectively retrieved for patients operated on between 1/7/19-31/12/19 (‘baseline data’) and an appendicitis diagnostic algorithm was developed. Imaging and risk stratification data were prospectively collected, as part of a national audit, between 20/03/30-23/6/20 for all adult appendicitis patients. This data was used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed diagnostic algorithm. Use of imaging and histological diagnoses was compared between datasets. RESULTS: 194 patients were included across both time periods. The rate of cross-sectional imaging increased from 36.6% to 76% and the normal appendicectomy rate (NAR) decreased from 5.22% to 2.4%. Thirty-six percent of patients in the latter time period were not managed in accordance with the proposed algorithm. The proposed diagnostic algorithm may have prevented up to 87.5% of normal appendicectomies across both time periods. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing cross-sectional imaging was associated with a decrease in the NAR. The use of the proposed diagnostic algorithm may have reduced the NAR further.","Zucker, B E; Loro, F; Tyer, A; Shabbir, J; Finch-Jones, M; Blencowe, N",Br J Surg,473,16

While often attempting to employ this in corporate venturing activities, they face the challenge of simultaneously exploring new and exploiting existing business opportunities. Examining possible approaches to mastering this feat of ‘organizational ambidexterity’ reveals an extensive but scattered picture. To better integrate this effort by assessing how corporate venturing is linked with organizational ambidexterity in the literature and identifying possible organizational setups, this systematic literature review builds on a sample of 172 studies. Based on different dimensions of dynamic capabilities, the analysis indicates that corporate venturing may take a solely explorative or an exploitative role, or balance both, to directly enable organizational ambidexterity, following a ‘trade-off’, respectively ‘paradox’, school of thought. As a result, this paper identifies four different setups of corporate venturing in an integrated framework, based on the ability and approach to enabling organizational ambidexterity. Here, the synthesis in the proposed framework of the studies examined allows differentiating between not directly ambidextrous separated or integrated corporate venturing and directly ambidextrous contextual or interlinked corporate venturing. As a novel contribution to the fields of strategic management, organizational change and corporate entrepreneurship, this integrated perspective suggests an often overlooked, potentially more strategic role for corporate venturing in the strategic renewal of a firm’s competitive advantage, thus building the basis for further empirical research on strategic corporate venturing approaches for organizational ambidexterity and their application in practice.

RESEARCH PURPOSE: The purpose of the research was to determine how prepared IOPs are to counsel employees during the pandemic and how responsive they are to provide counselling. MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY: It is not clear to what extent such counselling is being practised by IOPs in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH APPROACH/DESIGN AND METHOD: A qualitative approach was used to gain an understanding of registered South African IOPs’ experiences of workplace counselling, particularly during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN FINDINGS: Regarding preparedness, we found that IOPs are ill-prepared to counsel in the workplace. Preparedness was influenced by participants’ counselling education, skills and knowledge; experience; convictions about counselling; and psychological and organisational preparedness. Whilst some IOPs did engage in more counselling during the COVID-19 pandemic, most reverted to mitigating actions such as referrals, wellness management, equipping managers and change initiatives. PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study indicate that, under pandemic conditions, there is an increased need for counselling practices within the workplace and that IOPs should explore the ways in which they could play a more active role in such counselling. CONTRIBUTION/VALUE-ADD: Although we found that IOPs generally responded to employees’ mental health needs in a positive manner, there was a lack of counselling preparedness and responsiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","du Plessis, Marieta; Thomas, Emma C.",,473,29

Similarly, a thorough understanding of the requirements and impact of CQI is critical to its successful institutionalisation. However, this is currently lacking. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to describe the CQI implementation process and examine its effect on HIV and TB service delivery at selected primary healthcare facilities in two South African districts. METHOD: We used a separate sample, pre- and post-test, quasi-experimental study design based on data collected from the clinical audit of patient cohorts seen in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Quality was measured based on the extent to which prescribed services were provided. Tailored CQI interventions were implemented based on service delivery gaps identified by the 2014 CQI audit. Data were summarised and analysed using a combination of univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The services identified as low quality were related to opportunistic infections management and laboratory practices. Compliance to prescribed service items in antiretroviral treatment initiation and monitoring, pharmacy and laboratory management, exceeded 70% across study sites. Over 80% of low quality service delivery items were optimised in less than six months with targeted quality improvement support. CONCLUSION: The observed improvements signal the effectiveness of the CQI approach, its capacity to rapidly improve under-performance, its high replicability and the need to provide quality maintenance support to sustain or improve healthcare facilities performing well. The study strongly underscores the need to improve the management of opportunistic infections and complications, particularly TB.","Gaga, Sisanda; Mqoqi, Nokuzola; Chimatira, Raymond; Moko, Singilizwe; Igumbor, Jude O.",South Afr J HIV Med,473,24

However, with limited studies available in this population, the safe use of antibiotics in pregnancy remains a concern. AIM: To evaluate the use of antibiotics amongst pregnant women attending a public health care facility. The main objective of this study was to quantify the types of antibiotics used in pregnant women. SETTING: A public hospital classified as a referral hospital located in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal.

Rifamycin (2.9%), hydrazides (2.2%) and aminoglycosides (1.9%) were less frequently prescribed. Most antibiotics were prescribed for diseases of the circulatory system (36.1%). CONCLUSION: Several classes of antibiotics were used in pregnancy despite the lack of available safety data and clinical evidence. Informing women of the potential side effects and keeping abreast with new information played an important role in the safe, rational and effective use of medicines that contributed to improving maternal health.","Naidoo, Sasha; Bangalee, Varsha; Oosthuizen, Frasia",Health SA,473,16

This study examined if the early impact of COVID-19 on livelihoods and food security differed between rural and urban areas in six Asia-Pacific countries. METHODS: Secondary data analysis was conducted in May 2029 using a total of 13,522 household survey data collected cross-sectionally among socially disadvantaged populations through a World Vision's rapid response assessment (n = 13,522) in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Changes in food expenditure, availability of various food items, and accessibility and affordability of essential items (staple food, fresh foods, medicine, and hygiene) were tested between rural and urban areas using multivariate logistic regressions, accounting for confounding variables. RESULTS: Job loss or reduced income was prevalent (rang: 54.1%–89.6%), higher in urban than rural areas in all six countries. A higher percentage of households reduced food expenditure in urban areas (53.0%–80.3%) than in rural areas (34.2%–66.4%) in India, Myanmar, and Vietnam (all P < 0.001). The proportion of households having no food stock varied in six countries (13.4%-66.0%), with lower odds of available food stocks in urban areas than rural areas (OR range in Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar: 0.30–0.53, all P < 0.05). Access to essential items was moderate to high depending on the type of item. Essential medicines were more accessible in urban than in rural areas with an OR range of 1.88–5.63 in India, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Household affordability was low particularly for rent (3.8%-16.6%) and loan repayment (3.3%-19.9%), with higher affordability for rent payments in urban than in rural areas with an OR range of 1.98–22.2 across four countries (P < 0.05). Access and affordability for essential items were better in urban areas than in rural areas in Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS: Disproportional differences were found in experiencing food security and livelihoods between rural and urban areas in six Asia Pacific countries. An understanding of the differential implications of lockdowns related to COVID-19 by residence can inform specifically recovery policies and guide mitigation efforts.

If consumers remain loyal to a brand, it is because they understand, sympathize with, and value the brand’s concept. However, few studies have focused on brand concept as a factor of loyalty. Therefore, this study verified the influence of the brand concept on repurchase intention. Through multiple regression analysis of Apple MacBook Pro, Dyson Big Ball, Nintendo Switch, Facebook, Starbucks, and Tokyo Disney Resort users in Japan, the first hypothesis—consumers who recall a brand concept are more likely to have repurchase intention than those who recall specific features when asked about brand attractiveness—was supported. Furthermore, Fisher’s exact test supported a second hypothesis—consumers with high loyalty maintain high-level construal, even if they use a brand frequently and recall the concept as the brand’s attractiveness, contrary to construal level theory. By introducing the viewpoint of brand loyalty, the conditions under which construal level theory does not conform were shown. The present study encourages reaffirmation of the importance of brand concept and suggests the concept recall index to effectively use management resources.","Kato, Takumi",J Market Anal,473,16

We are embedded in a new complex set of relations, with other species, with cultural signs, and with technology and venturing further into an era that pushes back on our anthropocentrism to create a post-human dystopia. This does not imply that we are less human or forfeit ethics in this state of flux, but can lead to considering new ways of being alive and humanists. The aim of this project was to explore walking through our associated psychogeographies as captured in photographs and text from individual walks, as the means by which to characterize responses to the distress of the pandemic and to assess resistance to non-being. The psychogeographies were the starting points for our dialogic enquiry between authors who each represent living theory, representing their own emergent knowledge, inseparable from personal commitments and history. Walking and the associated images and reflections, provided a way to regulate our affect, reconnecting with our bodies, leading to understand and adapt to new meanings of context and ways of coping and healing in this new becoming. The interdisciplinarity of philosophy, social psychology, botany, and clinical psychology is nonetheless rejected in favour of multi-vocality; each author representing their own emergent, living theory, inseparable from personal commitments, and history.","Degen, Johanna L.; Smart, Gemma Lucy; Quinnell, Rosanne; O’Doherty, Kieran C.; Rhodes, Paul",Hu Arenas,473,24

In doing so, it examines the links between language and socio‐political discourse, focusing on tropes that invoke and engage with geographies of everyday life. The foundational contention is that, to a large extent, language constructs our lived reality. After reviewing scholarship linking language and disease, the commentary turns to a case study of New Zealand’s response to COVID‐19. The public health goal was to instil caution and protective practices in the population at large as a defence against transmission. The role of narrative and metaphor in daily press conferences from the Prime Minister and Director General of Health through March and April 2020 is examined by drawing on evidence from media reporting. Three key metaphors are considered: bubbles, levels, and the team, with each metaphor having spatialised implications in the popular imagination. The commentary considers perceptual and behavioural implications of this strategic use of metaphor. I speculate on the ways in which language has an agency such that, until the widespread availability of vaccine, an infectious disease can be restricted through mobilising the population.","Kearns, Robin",,473,22

A total of 405 female undergraduate students were selected, and completed questionnaires that had been previously validated in Spanish University students (Big Five personality factors, resilience, and academic stress symptoms and factors). A linear, ex-post facto design was used, including linear regression, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), and mediational analyses. Specific linear regression showed the expected gradation: that self-regulatory personality factors (conscientiousness, extraversion) were positive linear predictors of proactive resilience, as well as significant negative predictors of stress factors and symptoms of academic stress; while the non-regulatory personality factors (openness to experience, agreeableness) showed little relationship. By contrast, the dysregulatory personality factor (neuroticism) was a negative predictor of proactive resilience, a positive predictor of reactive resilience, and positively predicted academic stress factors in the teaching and learning process, as well as stress symptoms. SEM general analysis showed that personality factors positively predicted resilience, and resilience negatively predicted factors and symptoms of academic stress. Specific mediational model analysis, with each personality factor, confirmed the different mediating relationships that appeared in the linear regression analyses. These results are discussed from the perspective of promoting resilience and healthy personalities in the University context. Implications for addressing academic stress at University are discussed.","de la Fuente, Jesús; González-Torres, María Carmen; Artuch-Garde, Raquel; Vera-Martínez, Manuel Mariano; Martínez-Vicente, Jose Manuel; Peralta-S'anchez, Francisco Javier",Front Psychiatry,473,1

Didactically, teaching analytics is one of the promising and emerging methods within the Education domain that have proved to be useful, towards scholastic ways to make use of substantial pieces of evidence drawn from educational data to improve the teaching–learning processes and quality of performance. For this purpose, this study proposed an educational process and data mining plus machine learning (EPDM + ML) model applied to contextually analyze the teachers’ performances and recommendations based on data derived from students’ evaluation of teaching (SET). The EPDM + ML model was designed and implemented based on amalgamation of the Text mining and Machine learning technologies that builds on the descriptive decision theory, which studies the rationality behind decisions the learners are disposed to make based on the textual data quantification and statistical analysis. To this effect, the study determines pedagogical factors that influences the students' recommendations for their teachers, what role the sentiment and emotions expressed by the students in the SET play in the way they evaluate the teachers by taking into account the gender of the teachers. This includes how to automatically predict what a student’s recommendation for the teachers may be based on information about the students’ gender, average sentiment, and emotional valence they have shown in the SET. Practically, we applied the Text mining technique to extract the different sentiments and emotions (intensities of the comments) expressed by the students in the SET, and then utilized the quantified data (average sentiment and emotional valence) to conduct an analysis of covariance and Kruskal Wallis Test to determine the influential factors, as well as, how the students’ recommendation for the teachers differ by considering the gender constructs, respectively. While a large proportion of the comments that we analyzed (n = 85,378) was classified to be neutral and predominantly interpreted to be positive in nature considering the sentiments (76.4%), and emotional valence (88.2%) expressed by the students. The results of our analysis shows that for the students’ comments which contain some kind of positive or negative sentiment (23.6%) and emotional valence (11.8%); that females students recommended the teachers taking into account the sentiments (p = .000). While the males appear to be slightly borderline in terms of emotions (p = .056) and sentiment (p = .077). Also, the EPDM + ML model showed to be a good predictor and efficient method in determining what the students’ recommendation scores for the teachers would be, going by the high and acceptable values of the precision (1.00), recall (1.00), specificity (1.00), accuracy (1.00), F1-score (1.00) and zero error-rate (0.00) which we validated using the k-fold cross-validation method, with 63.6% of optimal k-values observed. In theory, we note that not only does the proposed method (EPDM + ML) proves to be useful towards effective analysis of SET and its implications within the educational domain. But can be utilized to determine prominent factors that influences the students’ evaluation and recommendation of the teachers, as well as helps provide solutions to the ever-increasingly need to advance and support the teaching–learning processes and/or students’ learning experiences in a rapidly changing educational environment or ecosystem.","Okoye, Kingsley; Arrona-Palacios, Arturo; Camacho-Zuñiga, Claudia; Achem, Joaquín Alejandro Guerra; Escamilla, Jose; Hosseini, Samira",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),473,10

Secondary objectives of the study were to determine if the use of a 5-mm laparoscope would lead to a reduction in postoperative pain scores and a shorter operating time without an increase in complication rates. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING A tertiary care setting. PATIENTS Seventy-eight patients scheduled for TLH were prospectively recruited. INTERVENTIONS Women undergoing TLH were assigned to either a 5-mm umbilical port and laparoscope (5LH) or a 10-mm umbilical port and laparoscope (10LH). All patients underwent a standardized operative technique and anesthetic protocol. Patients and research assistants responsible for postoperative pain assessment were blinded to group. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome measure was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures were operating time, pain scores on postoperative days 1 and 7, and complication rates. There was no difference in length of hospital stay between the 2 arms. Compared with the 10LH group, the 5LH group had shorter operative times (32.6 vs 40 minutes; p = .01) and less postoperative pain on day 1 (2.5 vs 3.3; p = .03 for ""pain with movement"") and on day 7 (.92 vs 1.8; p = .002). Complication rates were similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION TLH with a 5-mm laparoscope resulted in shorter operative times and less pain on postoperative days 1 and 7, compared with a 10-mm laparoscope, with similar length of stay and complications.","Acton, Jade N; Salfinger, Stuart G; Tan, Jason; Cohen, Paul A",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,473,7

As the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin in the middle and inner ear remain unclear, we analyzed the expression of these proteins in mouse ear tissues. METHODS We performed immunohistochemical analysis to examine the distribution of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin in the Eustachian tube, middle ear spaces, and cochlea of mice. RESULTS ACE2 was present in the nucleus of the epithelium of the middle ear and Eustachian tube, as well as in some nuclei of the hair cells in the organ of Corti, in the stria vascularis, and the spiral ganglion cells. ACE2 was also expressed in the cytoplasm of the stria vascularis. TMPRSS2 was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the middle spaces, with the expression being stronger in the nucleus in the mucosal epithelium of the middle ear spaces and Eustachian tube. TMPRSS2 was present in the cytoplasm in the organ of Corti and stria vascularis and in the nucleus and cytoplasm in the spiral ganglion. Furin was expressed in the cytoplasm in the middle ear spaces, Eustachian tube, and cochlea. CONCLUSION ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin are diffusely present in the Eustachian tube, middle ear spaces, and cochlea, suggesting that these tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, they can be erroneously reported as type IV or V EL with supine computed tomography (CT) scans, leading to delay in management. Therefore, we describe a novel diagnostic technique, 'Prone contrASt enHanced computed tomography Angiography' (PASHA), to document concealed EL. TECHNICAL SUMMARY We present eight case-descriptions with continuous sac expansion following primary EVAR. Management began with diagnosis using the PASHA imaging technique. PASHA is a multi-phase CTA positional technique for increasing the accuracy of detecting EL post-EVAR. The PASHA technique diagnosed all cases of type IIIb EL, as it enhanced the degree of contrast infiltration into the aortic sac when micro-leaks were present. Furthermore, the PASHA imaging technique helped to guide whether the open or endovascular intervention could be employed effectively to manage the sac expansion. In synchrony with the PASHA technique, 'EVAR GORE SalvAge FAbric Technique' (ARAFAT) was used in five elderly patients to salvage previous EVAR. Another three had an open conversion; two with double breasting of the aortic sac and one EVAR explantation. DISCUSSION The PASHA protocol helped classify and localise the concealed ELs (type IV, V), which were not appropriately diagnosed by supine CT protocols. PASHA and ARAFAT were employed as a fully functioning protocol to overcome apparent challenges in accurate diagnosis and subsequent concealed EL management in high-risk patients.","Sultan, Sherif; Acharya, Yogesh; Atteia, Emad; Hynes, Niamh",Annals of vascular surgery,473,24

Paediatric surgery patient care could potentially benefit from these technologies. This systematic review summarises the current literature on the use of mHealth for postoperative care after children's surgery. METHODS Seven databases were searched by a senior medical librarian. Studies were included if they reported the use of mHealth systems for postoperative care for children <18 years old. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. RESULTS A total of 18 studies were included after screening. mHealth use was varied and included appointment or medication reminders, postoperative monitoring and postoperative instruction delivery. mHealth systems included texting systems and mobile applications, and were implemented for a wide range of surgical conditions and countries. DISCUSSION Studies showed that mHealth systems can increase the postoperative follow-up appointment attendance rate (p < 0.001), decrease the rate of postoperative complications and returns to the emergency department and reliably monitor postoperative pain. mHealth systems were generally appreciated by patients. Most non-randomised and randomised studies had many methodological problems, including lack of appropriate control groups, lack of blinding and a tendency to devote more time to the care of the intervention group. mHealth systems have the potential to improve postoperative care, but the lack of high-quality research evaluating their impact calls for further studies exploring evidence-based mHealth implementation.","Nguyen, Nam; Leveille, Etienne; Guadagno, Elena; Kalisya, Luc Malemo; Poenaru, Dan",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,473,12

Zebrafishes are widely used for measuring and detecting the toxicity. However, measuring and testing toxicity manually is not feasible due to the large number of embryos. This work presents an automated model to investigate the toxicity of two toxicants (3, 4-Dichloroaniline (34DCA) and p-Tert-Butylphenol (PTBP)). METHODS The proposed model consists of two steps. In the first step, a set of features is extracted from microscopic images of zebrafish embryos using the Segmentation-Based Fractal Texture Analysis (SFTA) technique. Secondly, a novel rough set-based model using Social ski-driver (SSD) is used to find a global minimal subset of features that preserves important information of the original features. In the third step, the AdaBoost classifier is used to classify an unknown sample to alive or coagulant after exposing the embryo to a toxic compound. RESULTS For detecting the toxicity, the proposed model is compared with (i) three deterministic rough set reduction algorithms and (ii) the PSO-based algorithm. The classification performance rate of our model was ranged from 97.1% to 99.5% and it outperformed the other algorithms. CONCLUSIONS The results of our experiments proved that the proposed drug toxicity model is efficient for rough set-based feature selection and it obtains a high classification performance.","Tharwat, Alaa; Darwish, Ashraf; Hassanien, Aboul Ella",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,473,1

Recent studies have shed light on the pathophysiology of traumatic-induced coagulopathy and the central role of endotheliopathy. Transfusion therapy has changed dramatically in the last decade with use of red cells and plasma in a 1:1 ratio. The use of early transfusion increases the likelihood of a favorable outcome. Early intervention-preferably less than 60 min of injury-is a major factor in improved survival. Experience with dried plasma products-lyophilized or freeze-dried-in Europe and South Africa has demonstrated both safety and efficacy. Dry plasma products are not available in the United States but several products are in development.

METHODS A total of 473 Korean employees participated in a cross-sectional survey in May 2020. Using structural equation modeling, we tested the following hypotheses: (a) job insecurity will partially mediate the relationship between perceived threat and well-being and (b) social capital through sports programs will moderate the relationship between job insecurity and well-being. Socioeconomic status was used as a control variable for well-being. RESULTS The hypothesized relationships in the structural model were all significant (P < .001). Bridging social capital through sports programs had a significant moderating effect on the proposed relationship. CONCLUSIONS Strong bridging social capital through employer-sponsored sports programs is likely to buffer the detrimental effect of job insecurity on employee well-being.","Kwon, Youngbum; Seo, Hyomin",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,473,16

However, subsequent hypovolemia (HOV) may be accompanied by a decrease of anemia tolerance, resulting in increased transfusion needs. We therefore investigated the effect of volume status on anemia tolerance. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Eighteen domestic pigs of either sex (mean weight, 23.5 ± 4.8 kg) were anesthetized, ventilated, and randomized into three experimental groups: normovolemia (no intervention), HOV (blood loss of 40% of blood volume), and hypervolemia (HEV; volume infusion of 40% of blood volume). The animals were then hemodiluted until their individual critical hemoglobin concentrations (Hbcrit ) were reached by the exchange of whole blood for hydroxyethyl starch (HES; 130:0.4). Subsequently, organ-specific hypoxia was assessed using pimonidazole tissue staining in relevant organs. Hemodynamic and metabolic variables were also investigated. RESULTS Despite significant differences in exchangeable blood volume, Hbcrit was the same in all groups (2.3 g/dL, NS). During HOV, tissue hypoxia was aggravated in the myocardium, brain, and kidneys, whereas tissue oxygenation of the liver and intestine was not influenced by volume status. HEV increased tissue hypoxia in the lungs, but did not impact tissue oxygenation of other organs. CONCLUSIONS The combination of hemorrhagic HOV with subsequent anemia leads to accentuated tissue hypoxia, revealed by a significant increase in pimonidazole binding at Hbcrit , in heart, lungs, brain, and kidney. The lungs were the only organ that showed increased tissue hypoxia after pretreatment of HES infusion and subsequent anemia by normovolemic hemodilution.","Krömker, Malte; Lauscher, Patrick; Kertscho, Harry; Zacharowski, Kai; Rosenberger, Peter; Meier, Jens",Transfusion,473,33

We report our experience with robotic first-rib resection. METHODS Patients diagnosed with Paget-schroetter syndrome underwent thrombolysis followed by robotic first-rib resection. The diagnosis was made by preoperative venography (VA) and magnetic resonance venography. The robot was used to dissect the first rib, disarticulate the costosternal joint and divide the scalene muscles. Success of the first-rib resection was assessed by physical examination, venogram and magnetic resonance venography. RESULTS Eighty-three robotic first-rib resections were performed (49 men and 34 women). The mean age of the patients was 24 years ± 8.5 years. The operative time was 127.6 min ± 20.8 min. The median hospitalization was 4 days. There were no surgical complications, neurovascular injuries or mortality. Patients with a patent subclavian vein on the postoperative venogram (57 of 83 patients, 69%) were anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months. In the remaining 27 patients with a persistent postoperative occlusion of the subclavian vein, 21 (21 of 83 patients, 24%) underwent angioplasty and were anticoagulated with warfarin for 3 months, and 6 (6 of 83, 7%) required stent placement to achieve complete vein patency. Patients who underwent stent placement received antiplatelet therapy in addition to warfarin anticoagulation for 3 months. At a median follow-up of 24 months, all patients had an open subclavian vein with a patency rate of 100%. CONCLUSIONS The robotic transthoracic first-rib resection is feasible and allows for a minimally invasive resection of the first rib, while minimizing neurovascular complications.","Gharagozloo, Farid; Meyer, Mark; Tempesta, Barbara; Gruessner, Stephan",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,473,1

One of the major complications of diabetes is diabetic foot syndrome that results in catastrophic events such as ulceration and amputation. Therefore, the main four strategies of diabetic foot care involve risk prediction, prevention, and early diagnosis and prompt intervention. The drivers of ulceration are multifactorial, and importantly, include microcirculatory changes in the diabetic skin. Cutaneous microcirculation on the foot is greatly influenced by the small fibers which mediate thermal sensation and pain perception in addition to sympathetic activities such as thermoregulation and vasodilation. The interdependence between the neurovascular elements means with the loss of small fiber functions, the corresponding microcirculatory responses may be compromised. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the impairment of the microcirculation may follow the order of the corresponding small fiber nerve dysfunction or vice versa. In this review, select neurovascular investigations that inform the cutaneous microcirculatory and small fiber nerve function in response to pain, cold, and heat and pressure stimuli are reviewed and discussed in this order of sensory loss: the loss of pain, cold, warmth, touch and deep pressure sensation. We also discuss the neurological and vascular characteristics of each of these neurovascular responses. This review highlights the influence of small fibers on cutaneous microcirculation and the need for prospective studies that can determine the course of microcirculatory impairment over time. This, in turn, may help clarify the exact role of microcirculatory changes in the pathway of ulceration. The insights from this review can be pertinent to understand key microcirculatory disturbances and given that the microcirculatory impairment develops at an early stage, relevant interventions can be implemented to possibly reverse or regress the course of the disease. Therefore, knowledge of the neurovascular interactions aids to map the disease progression for early diagnosis and prevention of adverse complications.","Balasubramanian, Gayathri; Vas, Prashanth; Chockalingam, Nachiappan; Naemi, Roozbeh",Frontiers in endocrinology,473,1

We show that it can detect Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen causing gonorrhea, with simultaneous genotyping of the pathogen for resistance to the antimicrobial drug ciprofloxacin in <15 min. The duplex test was integrated into a low-cost thermoplastic cartridge with automated processing of penile swab samples from patients using magnetic beads. A compact instrument conducted DNA extraction, PCR, and analysis of results while relaying data to the user via a smartphone app. This platform was tested on penile swab samples from sexual health clinics in Baltimore, MD, USA (n = 66) and Kampala, Uganda (n = 151) with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 97.7% (95% CI, 94.7 to 100%) and 97.6% (95% CI, 94.1 to 100%), respectively, for N. gonorrhoeae detection and 100% concordance with culture results for ciprofloxacin resistance.

We have completed the initial prospective evaluation of a technique we previously described and published: endoscopic subcutaneous anterior component separation (ACS) as an adjunct to mainly laparoscopic AWR. We now present the long-term clinical and imaging follow-up results. STUDY DESIGN Data were prospectively collected over a 3-year period (2012-2015) on patients who underwent AWR with endoscopic ACS. Inclusion criteria included the following: defects of 6-15 cm that are longer than wider; no skin dystrophy; no loss of domain; no active infection; no previous multiple, complex repairs; no previous multiple mesh repairs; and no high probability of severe adhesions. All patients were followed up clinically at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively and then annually. All patients underwent CT scanning of the abdominal wall (sagittal, axial, coronal, and 3D reconstruction) at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively and then annually. RESULTS Twenty consecutive patients underwent adjunctive endoscopic ACS: 17 laparoscopic AWRs, 2 open repairs, and 1 hybrid repair. Up to 38 months (mean 21 months) of follow-up, there were no ventral hernia recurrences or de novo hernias at the ACS site. One patient experienced partial primary closure failure. Morbidity consisted in one case each of hematoma, seroma, and transient neuralgia. Cosmetic results and patient satisfaction were excellent.

METHODS A total of 149 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy (Hx) were retrospectively investigated. Patients were divided into two groups: the patients with subcuticular suture combined with subcutaneous drainage (the drainage group; 61 patients) and the patients with nylon suture without subcutaneous drainage (the nylon group; 88 patients). After the operations, the complication rate of postoperative incisional SSI was analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS In the drainage group the rate of incisional SSI was significantly lower compared to the nylon group: 14-3 % (p = 0.033), respectively. Patients with incisional SSI needed significantly longer postoperative hospital care than the patients without incisional SSI: 28 versus 15 days (p < 0.005).

To control PMWS, we vaccinated dams at 4 and 2 weeks before pregnancy and again in the 12th week of gestation with an inactivated PCV2 vaccine (Circovac). Two producer farms run under the control of Swiss Swine Health Organization were selected for the experiment. Previously, in one farm PMWS was diagnosed on pigs after weaning, whereas in the other farm, pigs wasted during the fattening period. For the experiments 113 dams were randomly vaccinated, and 111 dams were sham injected. Vaccination increased serum antibodies in dams 3- to 9-fold, accompanied by serum antibody titer increases in their offspring. In the sixth week of life, progeny from vaccinated dams had about the same IgG antibody titers as progeny of unvaccinated dams at the third day of life. In sera of vaccinated dams only low concentrations of PCV2 DNA were detected, and no progeny developed PMWS. Interestingly, at day 56 four progeny of unvaccinated dams tested positive for anti-PCV2 IgM antibodies, indicating a primary infection with PCV2. Of economic importance is the observation that progeny of vaccinated dams had a significantly higher daily weight gain in the fattening period (farm X, +51 g/day; farm Y, +30 g/day) and thus a shortened fattening period of about 6 days compared to progeny of controls. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of subclinical circovirus infection and its effects on growth performance of fattening pigs by vaccination of dams.","Kurmann, J; Sydler, T; Brugnera, E; Buergi, E; Haessig, M; Suter, M; Sidler, X",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,473,5

METHODS We isolated 40 DAVFs supplied by either the tentorial artery of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or the posterior meningeal artery of the vertebral artery. These DAVFs were embolized with Onyx through the middle meningeal artery or the occipital artery. We reviewed the occurrence of reflux into the arteries of carotid or vertebral origin. RESULTS In all the cases, reflux occurred into the first millimeters of the DAVF arterial feeders arising from carotid or vertebral arteries but slowly enough to be controlled by interruption of Onyx injection. Reflux was always minimal and Onyx never reached the ostium of the arteries. No cerebral ischemic complications occurred in our series. CONCLUSION The behavior of Onyx is clearly different from that of cyanoacrylate glue, resulting in superior control during injection. Reflux into arteries arising from the ICA or vertebral artery during DAVF treatment always carries a risk of unintentional non-target embolization of normal cerebral vasculature but Onyx appears to be safe in this situation.","Abud, Thiago G; Houdart, Emmanuel; Saint-Maurice, Jean-Pierre; Abud, Daniel G; Baccin, Carlos E; Nguyen, Andrew D; Abdala, Nitamar",Clinical neuroradiology,473,12

METHODS A systematic literature search of related studies up to August 30, 2019 in the PubMed and Embase databases was performed, and the results were displayed by odds ratios (ORs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed using the STATA12.0 software using an allele model and a recessive model. RESULTS Three eligible studies covering 519 subjects (241 cases, 278 controls) were identified. No statistically significant association was detected between the 4G/5G polymorphism and SSNHL in any model (allele model: 5G vs. 4G, OR = 0.952, 95% CI = 0.765-1.185, P = 0.662; recessive model: 5G/5G vs. 4G/5G + 4G/4G, OR = 0.841, 95% CI = 0.415-1.704, P = 0.631).

This study aimed to explore the vowel production of Mandarin-speakers with post-stroke spastic dysarthria in connected speech and to explore the influence of gender and tone on the vowel production. Multiple vowel acoustic metrics, including F1 range, F2 range, vowel space area (VSA), vowel articulation index (VAI) and formant centralization ratio (FCR), were analyzed from vowel tokens embedded in connected speech produced. The participants included 25 clients with spastic dysarthria secondary to stroke (15 males, 10 females) and 25 speakers with no history of neurological disease (15 males, 10 females). Variance analyses were conducted and the results showed that the main effects of population, gender, and tone on F2 range, VSA, VAI, and FCR were all significant. Vowel production became centralized in the clients with post-stroke spastic dysarthria. Vowel production was found to be more centralized in males compared to females. Vowels in neutral tone (T0) were the most centralized among the other tones. The quantitative acoustic metrics of F2 range, VSA, VAI, and FCR were effective in predicting vowel production in Mandarin-speaking clients with post-stroke spastic dysarthria, and hence may be used as powerful tools to assess the speech performance for this population.","Ge, Shengnan; Wan, Qin; Yin, Minmin; Wang, Yongli; Huang, Zhaoming",Clinical linguistics & phonetics,473,1

Increasing frontline teams' quality improvement (QI) capability may increase the implementation readiness and success of EBI implementation. OBJECTIVES Develop a QI training program (""Learn. Engage. Act. Process."" (LEAP)) and evaluate its impact on frontline obesity treatment teams to improve treatment delivered within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). DESIGN This was a pre-post evaluation of the LEAP program. MOVE! coordinators (N = 68) were invited to participate in LEAP; 24 were randomly assigned to four starting times. MOVE! coordinators formed teams to work on improvement aims. Pre-post surveys assessed team organizational readiness for implementing change and self-rated QI skills. Program satisfaction, assignment completion, and aim achievement were also evaluated. PARTICIPANTS VHA facility-based MOVE! teams. INTERVENTIONS LEAP is a 21-week QI training program. Core components include audit and feedback reports, structured curriculum, coaching and learning community, and online platform. MAIN MEASURES Organizational readiness for implementing change (ORIC); self-rated QI skills before and after LEAP; assignment completion and aim achievement; program satisfaction. KEY RESULTS Seventeen of 24 randomized teams participated in LEAP. Participants' self-ratings across six categories of QI skills increased after completing LEAP (p< 0.0001). The ORIC measure showed no statistically significant change overall; the change efficacy subscale marginally improved (p < 0.08), and the change commitment subscale remained the same (p = 0.66). Depending on the assignment, 35 to 100% of teams completed the assignment. Nine teams achieved their aim. Most team members were satisfied or very satisfied (81-89%) with the LEAP components, 74% intended to continue using QI methods, and 81% planned to continue improvement work. CONCLUSIONS LEAP is scalable and does not require travel or time away from clinical responsibilities.

The previous method of reducing the risk of POPF was the application of a polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet to the pancreatic stump after cutting the pancreas with a stapler (After-stapling); the new method involves wrapping the pancreatic resection line with a PGA sheet before stapling (Before-stapling). The study aimed to compare the incidence of POPF and POFC between two methods. METHODS Data of patients who underwent open or laparoscopic DPs by a single surgeon from October 2010 to February 2020 in a tertiary referral hospital were retrospectively analyzed. POPF was defined according to the updated International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula criteria. POFC was measured by postoperative computed tomography (CT). RESULTS Altogether, 182 patients were enrolled (After-stapling group, n = 138; Before-stapling group, n = 44). Clinicopathologic and intraoperative findings between the two groups were similar. Clinically relevant POPF rates were similar between both groups (4.3% vs. 4.5%, p = 0.989). POFC was significantly lesser in the Before-stapling group on postoperative day 7 (p < 0.001).

The limited therapies, including protein-restricted diets and liver transplants, are not as effective as they could be for the treatment of MSUD due to the current lack of molecular insights into the disease pathogenesis. To address this issue, we developed a Drosophila model of MSUD by knocking out the dDBT gene, an ortholog of the human dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase (DBT) subunit of BCKDH. The homozygous dDBT mutant larvae recapitulate an array of MSUD phenotypes, including aberrant BCAA accumulation, developmental defects, poor mobile behavior, and disrupted L-glutamate homeostasis. Moreover, the dDBT mutation causes neuronal apoptosis during the developmental progression of larval brains. The genetic and functional evidence generated by in vivo depletion of dDBT expression in the eye shows severe impairment of retinal rhadomeres. Further, the dDBT mutant shows elevated oxidative stress and higher lipid peroxidation accumulation in the larval brain. Therefore we conclude from in vivo evidence that the loss of dDBT results in oxidative brain damage that may led to neuronal cell death and contribute to aspects of MSUD pathology. Importantly, when the dDBT mutants were administrated with Metformin, the aberrances in BCAA levels and motor behavior were ameliorated. This intriguing outcome strongly merits the use of the dDBT mutant as a platform for developing MSUD therapies.","Tsai, Hui-Ying; Wu, Shih-Cheng; Li, Jian-Chiuan; Chen, Yu-Min; Chan, Chih-Chiang; Chen, Chun-Hong",Disease models & mechanisms,473,30

Methods: The clinical data of one hundred and sixty patients with CRS treated by endoscopic sinus surgery in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from April 2018 to August 2019 were collected prospectively. The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) scores, self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores, Lund-Kennedy scores of nasal endoscopy and the Lund-Mackay scores of CT before and 6 months after surgery were used to analyse the correlation between the scores of anxiety or depression and the subjective and objective scores of patients before and after operation by grouping and layering. One hundred and one males (63.1%) and 59 females (36.9%) with an average age of 47.3 years (18-75 years) were included. Single-sample, independent or paired t-test, one-way ANOVA and rank-sum test were used for comparison and Pearson correlation analysis was used for the correlation between groups. Results: There was no statistical difference of anxiety or depression between different groups in terms of age, gender and course in the 160 effective patients (t values were -0.151, -0.487, -0.846, all P values>0.05; t values were -0.473, -1.302, -1.069, all P values>0.05).

Moreover, as far as the symptoms of overall discomfort, nasal obstruction, headache and runny nose, the results of one-way ANOVA showed that the improvement of symptoms in patients with serious anxiety or depression was worse than that of the normal, mild and moderate patients (all P values<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the scores of Lund-Kennedy 6 months after surgery between them (both P values>0.05). Conclusion: The state of anxiety or depression affects the improvement of symptoms after endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS patients. Compared with the patients with normal and mild to moderate anxiety or depression, the improvement of symptoms in patients with severe anxiety and depression is worse. It is necessary to evaluate the anxiety or depression of the patients with CRS who are going to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery.","Feng, D D; Huang, J J; Ke, X; Liu, J; Shen, Y; Yang, Y C",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,473,31

Previous researches have shown that short-term mechanical stretch induces stem cell proliferation through activating the predominant transcription factor YAP, and YAP is a critical modulator in controlling epidermal proliferation. However, our study finds that after this phase, the cell growth arrest appears which is induced by long-term mechanical stretch. In the interfollicular epidermal stem cells (IFESCs) undergoing long-term mechanical stretch in vivo and in vitro, the level of H3K27me3 and its histone methyltransferase EZH2 are significantly elevated with suppressed expression of the target genes of YAP. EZH2 forms repressive H3K27me3 that suppresses gene transcription. Small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 rescues significantly the cell growth arrest in IFESCs induced by long-term mechanical stretch, thus promoting epidermal proliferation in vivo again. These findings reveal that there is an unexpected correlation between stem cell proliferation and the duration of mechanical stretch regulated by EZH2.

The findings from linear regression indicated that empathic responding, in response to the threat of a virulent agent, was related to taking recommended and effective health precautions. On the other hand, wishful thinking was associated with those behaviours that may potentially lead to economic hardship in afflicted areas, such as avoiding people perceived to be at risk for an infectious agent. Implications for health promotion are discussed.","Puterman, E; DeLongis, A; Lee-Baggley, D; Greenglass, E",Global public health,473,16

In this study, we measured the perceived stress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among Iranians to determine the groups at both extremes of the spectrum followed by identifying the stressors and coping mechanisms. METHODS This study was a mixed-methods study. We distributed a web-based 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10), to measure perceived stress score (PSS), through social networks from March 12 to 23, 2020. Then, we interviewed 42 students, 31 homemakers, 27 healthcare providers, and 21 male participants to identify the sources of stress and coping mechanisms. RESULTS Finally, 13,454 participants completed the questionnaires. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the participants' PSS was 21 (15-25). Students, homemakers, and healthcare workers (HCWs) showed a higher median (IQR) of PSS compared to other groups (23 [18 to 27], 22 [16 to 26], and 19 [14 to 24], respectively). Male participants showed a lower median (IQR) PSS (17 [12 to 23]). Content analysis of 121 participants' answers showed that the most common stressors were school-related issues mentioned by students, family-related issues mentioned by homemakers, and COVID-19-related issues mentioned by healthcare providers. Male participants' coping mechanisms were mostly related to the perception of their abilities to cope with the current crisis. CONCLUSION Our participants clinically showed a moderate level of PSS. The main stressors among students, homemakers, and HCWs were related to their principal role in this period, and male participants' coping mechanisms were inspired by the self-image retrieved from the social perspectives.","Faghankhani, Masoomeh; Sodagari, Faezeh; Shokrani, Marjan; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Adabi, Alimohammad; Zabihi, Masoud; Adeli, Aliyeh Mahdavi; Fathimakvand, Mahdi; Golalipour, Elahe; Aghdasi, Sina; Javanbakht, Arash; Nadoushan, Amir Hossein Jalali",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Certain number of students are less compliant and likely to skip classes which may impact the overall academic performance. The aim of this study was to investigate dental students' attitude towards classroom attendance and potential reasons for absenteeism at King Abdulaziz University-Faculty of Dentistry (KAU-FD). METHODS This was a cross-sectional survey of all dental students actively enrolled at KAU-FD from January to June 2019. The survey included questions on demographics, average travel time to school, current dental year, most recent GPA, student's perspective toward classroom lectures. The survey was validated and distributed to all students at a pre-selected time frame. Data were analysed and presented as frequencies and percentages; chi-square test was used to explore parameters association. RESULTS A total of 678 students consented and completed the survey. Overall, 44.3% of students were more likely to skip two classes or less per month. Second year dental students were more likely to be absent from classroom lectures (31.3%), while 3rd year dental students were less likely to do so (15.4%). Reported students' justifications for missing classes included early morning classes (47.9%), exams preparation (42%), and lecturer's weak presentation skills (41.9%). CONCLUSION Compliance of dental students with classroom attendance has been an ongoing challenge for most programs. The current data suggests a multifactorial module for students' attitude toward classroom attendance. Future studies focusing on reasons behind classroom attendance behavior and addressing students' concerns are needed.","Alamoudi, Waleed A; Alhelo, Azza F; Almazrooa, Soulafa A; Felemban, Osama M; Binmadi, Nada O; Alhindi, Nada A; Ali, Sarah A; Akeel, Sara K; Alhamed, Sana A; Mansour, Ghadah M; Mawardi, Hani H",BMC medical education,473,31

METHODS Systematic Review. The search was performed in the following electronic databases: CINAHL, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Google Scholar was used for the gray literature search. RESULTS Seven studies were included which tested different arrangements of dressings: sterilized gauze and adhesive tape with a transparent polyurethane film (n = 2), transparent polyurethane film with a different replacement interval frequency (n = 2), transparent polyurethane film with and without chlorhexidine released continuously by the dressing at the site of intravascular catheter insertion (n = 2), and dressings vs. no dressings (n = 1). The meta-analysis for catheter-related infection prevention showed no difference between type of dressing (RR 1.76, [95% CI 0.82; 3.75], I2 0%) and for the replacement frequency at different intervals (RR 1.04, [95% CI 0.67; 1.61], I2 0%). The meta-analysis for skin irritation evaluated the transparent polyurethane film replacement frequency and indicated that a longer dressing replacement interval (10 to 15 days) reduces the risk of developing this outcome (RR 0.71, 0.52; 0.96, 95% CI, I2 24%). CONCLUSIONS Regarding the type of the dressing, there is no evidence indicating the best dressing. Although there is no evidence available for the ideal replacement frequency, the risk to develop skin irritation is reduced in longer dressing replacements intervals.","de Campos Pereira Silveira, Renata Cristina; Dos Reis, Paula Elaine Diniz; Ferreira, Elaine Barros; Braga, Fernanda Titareli Merizio Martins; Galvão, Cristina Maria; Clark, Alexander Michael",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,473,33

Continuation of psychiatric services for individuals with high clinical acuity was critical. This study examined attendance to rapidly deployed telehealth services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals receiving intensive outpatient program (IOP), primarily group-based psychotherapy services for adults and adolescents by race/ethnicity, insurance, and clinical treatment program within a large hospital-based outpatient psychiatric setting. Methods: Chi-square tests compared whether attendance rates for telehealth versus in-person IOP services varied by population group, race, insurance, and clinical program, using observational data of adolescent and adult patients treated between October 1, 2019, and July 31, 2020. Results: Appointment attendance increased for telehealth versus in-person services for adolescents (χ2 (df = 1) = 27.49, p < 0.0001) and adults (χ2 (df = 1) = 434.37, p < 0.0001). For adults, increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed across insurance type (Medicaid: +11.5%; Medicare: +13.79%; Commercial: +6.94%), race/ethnicity (+6.23% to +15.76% across groups), and for IOP groups across all five diagnostic treatment programs (between 7.59% and 15.9% increases across groups). Adolescent results were mixed; increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed among commercially insured youth (+7.11%), but no differences were observed for Medicaid-insured youth. Non-Hispanic white youth had increased attendance for telehealth (+8.38%) and no differences were observed for non-Hispanic black youth. Decreases were found in telehealth attendance for Hispanic/Latinx youth (-13.49%). Discussion: Rapidly deployed telehealth increased attendance to intensive services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals, particularly among adults and for adolescents with commercial insurance and non-Hispanic white youth. Trends among racial/ethnic and Medicaid-insured youth warrant further investigation regarding the potential for special challenges or vulnerabilities and advocacy needs. Findings highlight telehealth as an important tool in supporting availability of services for individuals with high levels of psychiatric acuity, particularly for group-based services, during the pandemic.","Childs, Amber W; Bacon, Sandra M; Klingensmith, Katherine; Li, Luming; Unger, Adam; Wing, Angelina M; Fortunati, Frank",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,473,1

ADARB1 encodes the enzyme ADAR2 that is highly expressed in the brain and essential to modulate the function of glutamate and serotonin receptors. Impaired ADAR2 editing causes early onset progressive epilepsy and premature death in mice. In humans, ADAR2 dysfunction has been very recently linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly and epilepsy in four unrelated subjects. METHODS We studied three children from two consanguineous families with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) through detailed physical and instrumental examinations. Exome sequencing (ES) was used to identify ADARB1 mutations as the underlying genetic cause and in vitro assays with transiently transfected cells were performed to ascertain the impact on ADAR2 enzymatic activity and splicing. RESULTS All patients showed global developmental delay, intractable early infantile-onset seizures, microcephaly, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, axial hypotonia and progressive appendicular spasticity. ES revealed the novel missense c.1889G>A, p.(Arg630Gln) and deletion c.1245_1247+1 del, p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variants in ADARB1 (NM_015833.4). The p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variant leads to incorrect splicing resulting in frameshift with a premature stop codon and loss of enzyme function. In vitro RNA editing assays showed that the p.(Arg630Gln) variant resulted in a severe impairment of ADAR2 enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION In conclusion, these data support the pathogenic role of biallelic ADARB1 variants as the cause of a distinctive form of DEE, reinforcing the importance of RNA editing in brain function and development.","Maroofian, Reza; Sedmík, Jiří; Mazaheri, Neda; Scala, Marcello; Zaki, Maha S; Keegan, Liam P; Azizimalamiri, Reza; Issa, Mahmoud; Shariati, Gholamreza; Sedaghat, Alireza; Beetz, Christian; Bauer, Peter; Galehdari, Hamid; O'Connell, Mary A; Houlden, Henry",Journal of medical genetics,473,12

Due to the recent explosion of heterogeneous multimodal data sources generated in the biomedical domain, and an industry shift toward a systems biology approach, knowledge graphs have emerged as attractive methods of data storage and hypothesis generation. AREAS COVERED In this review, the author summarizes the applications of knowledge graphs in drug discovery. They evaluate their utility; differentiating between academic exercises in graph theory, and useful tools to derive novel insights, highlighting target identification and drug repurposing as two areas showing particular promise. They provide a case study on COVID-19, summarizing the research that used knowledge graphs to identify repurposable drug candidates. They describe the dangers of degree and literature bias, and discuss mitigation strategies. EXPERT OPINION Whilst knowledge graphs and graph-based machine learning have certainly shown promise, they remain relatively immature technologies. Many popular link prediction algorithms fail to address strong biases in biomedical data, and only highlight biological associations, failing to model causal relationships in complex dynamic biological systems. These problems need to be addressed before knowledge graphs reach their true potential in drug discovery.","MacLean, Finlay",Expert opinion on drug discovery,473,24

During the last months, the scientific community has been debating on the potential harmful effect of Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or Angiotensin II receptor Type 1 receptor blockers (AT1-Receptor blockers, ARBs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is because the S spike protein of SARS8 CoV viruses utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter alveolar epithelial cells. Obesity, often associated to type 2 Diabetes, was shown to worsen the prognosis of SARS-CoV2 infection. Herein we discuss the complex interaction between the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), its receptors, and the interaction with the Kallikrein-Kinin-System (KKS) and the potential activation of the coagulation cascade. Alteration of the equilibrium between the RAAS system and the KKS cascade may explain the frequent thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 mainly seen in obese and diabetic-obese patients. In contrast, angiotensin (1-7) contributes to maintaining a correct balance between RAAS and KKS system. Our conclusion is that the higher mortality rate in patients with obesity is linked to the alteration of RAS and RAS-KKS interaction consequent to SARS-CoV2-cell entrance. At present, no data support the necessity of modifying ACEi or ARBs treatment in hypertensive patients.","Luzi, Livio; Bucciarelli, Loredana; Ferrulli, Anna; Terruzzi, Ileana; Massarini, Stefano",Minerva endocrinologica,473,30

Increased MERS cases and no licensed MERS vaccines highlight the need to develop safe and effective vaccines against MERS. We have previously demonstrated that a receptor-binding domain (RBD) fragment containing residues 377-588 of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein is a critical neutralizing domain and an important vaccine target. Nevertheless, its optimal immunogen dosage and immunization interval, key factors for human-used vaccines that induce protective immunity, have never been investigated. In this study, we optimized these criteria using a recombinant MERS-CoV RBD protein fused with Fc (S377-588-Fc) and utilized the optimal immunization schedule to evaluate the protective efficacy of RBD against MERS-CoV infection in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice. Compared with one dose and 2 doses at 1-, 2-, and 3-week intervals, a regimen of 2 doses of this protein separated by an interval of 4 weeks induced the strongest antibody response and neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection, and maintained at a high level during the detection period. Notably, RBD protein at the optimal dosage and interval protected hDPP4-Tg mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge, and the protection was positively correlated with serum neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, the optimal immunogen dosage and immunization interval identified in this study will provide useful guidelines for further development of MERS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for human use.","Wang, Yufei; Tai, Wanbo; Yang, Jie; Zhao, Guangyu; Sun, Shihui; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying; Gao, Jimin",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,473,1

Because of their huge burden and the vulnerability imposed during a health crisis, prevention and care of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will need to be prioritized even further. Maternal and child health are inextricably linked with NCDs and their risk factors. The intergenerational impact of poor maternal nutrition and health conditions during pregnancy, particularly NCD-related pregnancy complications, can be considered as a multiplier of the ongoing pandemic of NCDs. The economic cost of poor maternal health and NCD-related pregnancy complications is likely very high, but is not adequately researched or documented in the context of long-term population health. Interventions to address NCDs in pregnancy have beneficial effects on short-term pregnancy outcomes; but even more importantly, identifying ""at-risk"" mothers and offspring opens up the opportunity for targeted early preventive action. Preventive actions to address obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases have a common lifestyle approach-identifying any one of these problems in pregnancy provides an opportunity to address them all. Cost-benefit analyses that only focus on the short-term and on one condition do not capture the full value of downstream, long-term benefits for population health.

Osteophyte formation is known to be facilitated by synovial macrophage activation. TA injections might influence macrophage activation and subsequently reduce osteophytosis. Although widely applied in clinical care, the mechanism through which TA exerts this effect remains unknown. In this animal study, we investigated the in vivo effects of TA injections on macrophage activation, osteophyte development and joint degeneration. Furthermore, in vitro macrophage differentiation experiments were conducted to further explain working mechanisms of TA effects found in vivo. METHODS Osteoarthritis was induced in rat knees using papain injections and a running protocol. Untreated and TA-treated animals were longitudinally monitored for 12 weeks with in vivo micro-computed tomography (μCT) to measure subchondral bone changes. Synovial macrophage activation was measured in vivo using folate receptor β (FRβ)-targeted single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. Articular cartilage was analyzed at 6 and 12 weeks with ex vivo contrast-enhanced μCT and histology. To further explain the outcomes of our in vivo study, TA on macrophages was also studied in vitro. These cultured macrophages were either M1- or M2-activated, and they were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting for CD163 and FRβ expression as well as for messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of interleukin (IL)-10. RESULTS Our in vivo study showed that intra-articular injections with TA strongly enhanced FRβ(+) macrophage activation. Despite stimulated macrophage activation, osteophyte formation was fully prevented. There was no beneficial effect of TA against cartilage degradation or subchondral bone sclerosis. In vitro macrophage cultures showed that TA strongly induced monocyte differentiation towards CD163(+) and FRβ(+) macrophages. Furthermore, TA-stimulated M2 macrophages showed enhanced IL-10 expression at the mRNA level. CONCLUSIONS TA injections potently induce a CD163(+)- and FRβ(+)-activated macrophage with anti-inflammatory characteristics such as reduced IL-10 production in vitro and lack of osteophytosis in vivo.","Siebelt, Michiel; Korthagen, Nicoline; Wei, Wu; Groen, Harald; Bastiaansen-Jenniskens, Yvonne; Müller, Christina; Waarsing, Jan Hendrik; de Jong, Marion; Weinans, Harrie",Arthritis research & therapy,473,24

Aurora B differentially regulates kinetochore attachment to the microtubule plus end and its lateral side (end-on and lateral attachment, respectively). However, it is still unclear how kinetochore-microtubule interactions are exchanged during error correction. Here, we reconstituted the budding yeast kinetochore-microtubule interface in vitro by attaching the Ndc80 complexes to nanobeads. These Ndc80C nanobeads recapitulated in vitro the lateral and end-on attachments of authentic kinetochores on dynamic microtubules loaded with the Dam1 complex. This in vitro assay enabled the direct comparison of lateral and end-on attachment strength and showed that Dam1 phosphorylation by Aurora B makes the end-on attachment weaker than the lateral attachment. Similar reconstitutions with purified kinetochore particles were used for comparison. We suggest the Dam1 phosphorylation weakens interaction with the Ndc80 complex, disrupts the end-on attachment, and promotes the exchange to a new lateral attachment, leading to error correction.","Doodhi, Harinath; Kasciukovic, Taciana; Clayton, Lesley; Tanaka, Tomoyuki U",The Journal of cell biology,473,20

There are limited population-level data comparing deaths in these two locations. We aimed to compare the characteristics of people who die in critical care units and in hospices, identify factors associated with place of death and report 12-year trends in Scotland. METHODS We undertook a cohort study of decedents aged ≥16 years in Scotland (2005-2017). Location of death was identified from linkage to the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group database and National Records of Scotland Death Records. We developed a multinomial logistic regression model to identify factors independently associated with location of death. RESULTS There were 710 829 deaths in Scotland, of which 36 316 (5.1%) occurred in critical care units and 42 988 (6.1%) in hospices. As a proportion of acute hospital deaths, critical care deaths increased from 8.0% to 11.2%. Approximately one in eight deaths in those aged under 40 years occurred in critical care. Factors independently associated with hospice death included living in less deprived areas, cancer as the cause of death and presence of comorbidities. In contrast, liver disease and accidents as the cause of death and absence of comorbidities were associated with death in critical care. CONCLUSIONS Similar proportions of deaths in Scotland occur in critical care units and hospices. Given the younger age profile and unexpected nature of deaths occurring in critical care units, there is a need for a specific focus on end-of-life and bereavement support services in critical care units.","Mayes, Jonathan; McLachlan, Stela; Carduff, Emma; McPeake, Joanne; Boyd, Kirsty J; Pattison, Natalie; Lone, Nazir",BMJ supportive & palliative care,473,1

METHODS Sixty subjects recovering from symptomatic COVID-19 were included. One group of 30 followed a standard recovery management while 30 comparable subjects received a supplement of 150 mg Pycnogenol® daily (in 3 doses of 50 mg) in addition to standard management. RESULTS Two groups of selected subjects were comparable at baseline. The groups progressively improved both with the SM (standard management) and with the SM in combination with the supplement. Patients, supplemented with Pycnogenol® showed significantly better improvement compared to the control group patients. No side effects from the supplementation were observed; tolerability was optimal. The progressive evolution over time was visible in all target measurements. Physiological tests. Endothelial function, low in all subjects at inclusion was assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and finger reactive hyperemia in the microcirculation (laser Doppler measurements) after the release of an occluding suprasystolic cuff). It was significantly improved in the Pycnogenol® group after one month and after 3 months (p<0.05 vs controls). The rate of ankle swelling (RAS) by strain gauge decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) in comparison with controls showing an improvement of the capillary filtration rate. At inclusion, the kidney cortical flow velocity indicated a decrease in perfusion (lower systolic and diastolic flow velocity) in all patients. Kidney cortical flow velocity increased significantly with the supplement (p<0.05) in comparison with controls with improvement in systolic velocity and in diastolic component. High sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and Il-6 plasma levels decreased progressively over 3 months with a significant more pronounced decrease in the supplement group (p<0.05). The number of patients with normal plasma IL-6 levels at the end of the study was higher (p<0,05) with the supplement. ESR followed the same pattern with a progressive and a more significant decrease in the supplemented subjects (p<0.02). Oxidative stress decreased significantly in the supplemented group (p<0.05) compared with the control group. Blood pressure and heart rate were normalized in all subjects in the supplement group; systolic pressure was significantly lower in the supplemented group (p<0,05) at the end of the study. Finally, the scores of Quality-of-life, mood and fatigue questionnaire and the Karnofsky scale performance index significantly improved in the supplement group (p<0.05) compared to controls after 1 and 3 months. All other blood parameters (including platelets and clotting factors) were within normal values at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, Pycnogenol® may offer a significant option for managing some of the signs and symptoms associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome. This pilot evaluation offers some potential rationale for the use of Pycnogenol® in this condition that will have significant importance in the coming years.","Belcaro, Gianni; Cornelli, Umberto; Cesarone, Maria Rosaria; Scipione, Claudia; Scipione, Valeria; Hu, Shu; Feragalli, Beatrice; Corsi, Marcello; Cox, David; Cotellese, Roberto; Hosoi, Morio",Minerva medica,473,28

The positive result of nucleic acid test is a golden criterion to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the detection features remain unclear. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis in 5,630 high-risk individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in Wuhan, China, and investigated their characteristics and diagnosis rates. RESULTS The overall diagnosis rate was 34.7% (1,952/5,630). Male (P = 0.025) and older age (P = 2.525 × 10-39) were two significant risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30- to 69-years-old. Besides, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the number of testing in 501 subjects. Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (35.5%/27.9%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847 × 10-9), and a 1.43-fold improvement (39.9%/27.9%) from testing once to three times (P = 7.797 × 10-14). More than three testing times was not helpful for further improvement. However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097). CONCLUSION All populations are susceptible to SARS-Cov-2 infection, and male and older age are two significant risk factors. Increasing the number of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia. It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative for the first time, and to perform three testing times is better if available.","Shen, Na; Zhu, Yaowu; Wang, Xiong; Peng, Jing; Liu, Weiyong; Wang, Feng; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong",JCI insight,473,16

METHODS All patients with stage 4 pelvic organ prolapse were treated with vaginal hysterectomy, native tissue cystocele and rectocele repair and bilateral sacrospinous vaginal fixation. Anatomical and functional outcomes according to the POPq classification system and the German version of the Australian pelvic floor questionnaire were assessed. Changes between baseline, first follow-up and second follow-up were assessed by the paired Wilcoxon rank test using R, version 3.5.1. RESULTS 20 patients were included in the study. Scores in all four domains of the pelvic floor symptom questionnaire (bladder, bowel, prolapse, sexual function) were significantly improved at 6 and 12-months follow-up. One patient presented with a symptomatic stage 3 cystocele that needed a second surgical intervention and two patients needed surgery due to a de novo stress urinary incontinence. There were no perioperative adverse events and all patients reported full satisfaction after surgery. CONCLUSIONS The vaginal approach with hysterectomy, native tissue repair and bilateral sacrospinous vaginal fixation seems to be a safe and effective method for the treatment of advanced stage POP, offering excellent relief in all pelvic floor symptoms.

Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the outcome in patients who take PPIs. Eight articles with more than 268,683 subjects were included. PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95% CI=0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11).

In summary, PPI use is not associated with an increased risk of infection and may not change the mortality risk of COVID-19, but appeared to be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe disease and secondary infection. However, more original studies to further clarify the relationship between PPI and COVID-19 are still urgently needed.","Yan, Cunye; Chen, Yue; Sun, Chenyu; Ahmed, Mubashir Ayaz; Bhan, Chandur; Guo, Zhichun; Yang, Hongru; Zuo, Yijing; Yan, Yue; Hu, Lei; Sun, Yiceng; Li, Yao; Zhou, Qin",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,473,17

Therefore, many elective diagnostic and surgical procedures are being suspended or significantly delayed. Moreover, patients might find it difficult to refer to physicians and delay the diagnostic and even the therapeutic procedures because of emotional or logistic problems. The effect of diagnostic and therapeutic delay on survival in patients affected by gastrointestinal malignancies is still unclear. METHODS We carried out a review of the available literature, in order to determine whether the delay in performing diagnosis and curative-intent surgical procedures affects the oncological outcomes in patients with oesophageal, gastric, colorectal cancers, and colorectal liver metastasis. RESULTS The findings indicate that for oesophageal, gastric and colon cancers delaying surgery up to 2 months after the end of the staging process does not worsen the oncological outcomes. Oesophageal cancer should undergo surgery within 7-8 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Rectal cancers should undergo surgery within 31 days after the diagnostic process and within 12 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy should start within 4 weeks after surgery, especially in gastric cancer; a delay up to 42 days may be allowed for oesophageal cancer undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Gastrointestinal malignancies can be safely managed taking into account that reasonable delays of planned treatments appear a generally safe approach, not having a significant impact on long-term oncological outcome.","DE Rosa, Michele; Pasculli, Alessandro; Rondelli, Fabio; Mariani, Lorenzo; Avenia, Stefano; Ceccarelli, Graziano; Testini, Mario; Avenia, Nicola; Bugiantella, Walter",Minerva surgery,473,1

Material and Methods: Twenty-one individuals were participated in the crossover study with the visual-time reproduction task under three-speed conditions: original, slow and fast virtual stimulus. In addition, the electroencephalographic analysis of the theta band power in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was done simultaneously with time production task execution. Results: The results demonstrated that in the slow speed condition, there is an increase in the error in the time production task after virtual reality (p < 0.05). There is also increased EEG theta power in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in all speed conditions (p < 0.05). Conclusions: We propose that the modulations of speed of virtual stimulus may underlie the accumulation of temporal pulses, which could be responsible for changes in the performance of the production task of the time intervals and a substantial increase in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity related to attention and memory, acting in cognitive domains of supraseconds.","Silva, Diandra Caroline Martins E; Marinho, Victor; Teixeira, Silmar; Teles, Gabriela; Marques, João; Escórcio, Anderson; Fernandes, Thayaná; Freitas, Ana Cláudia; Nunes, Monara; Ayres, Marcos; Ayres, Carla; Marques, Juliana Bittencourt; Cagy, Maurício; Gupta, Daya S; Bastos, Victor Hugo",The International journal of neuroscience,473,5

Particular attention has been paid to delays in accessing timely pediatric care leading to unintended morbidity. In this study, we aim to describe the broader spectrum of unintended negative consequences for pediatric patients and families due to recent health care and societal changes. METHODS All full-time doctors, dentists, and nurse practitioners working at a tertiary care children's hospital in Canada were surveyed every 2 weeks throughout the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify clinical cases in which they perceived a negative outcome associated with hospital or societal changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis followed a qualitative case series methodology using a narrative synthesis approach to determine similarities and associated themes. RESULTS One hundred and forty-one clinicians, representing 26 hospital divisions, reported 57 unique cases in the first 6 weeks of the study. Thematic analysis of the first 50 reported cases was used to identify 6 primary themes focusing on health care quality domains as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care). CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary case analysis, we describe the broad social and clinical impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized pediatric patients and their families. These themes highlight the unintended consequence on families, siblings, disease diagnosis, and hospital-based care provision. Recognition and understanding of the broad implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are necessary as we strive to deliver safe, high-quality, family-centered pediatric care in this new era.","Diskin, Catherine; Orkin, Julia; Agarwal, Tanvi; Parmar, Arpita; Friedman, Jeremy N",Hospital pediatrics,473,1

Therefore, the diagnosis is challenging, and there are no recommendations regarding a specific surgical approach. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present the case of a 56-year-old woman with a De Garengeot's hernia doubly complicated: strangulated and with appendicitis in the hernia sac. The diagnosis was made intraoperatively, and it was managed fully through a single inguinal incision. No postoperative complication was presented, and the patient was discharged 48 h after. DISCUSSION The clinical presentation of this sub-type of hernia is non-specific. Precise knowledge of the hernia sac content preoperatively is not mandatory, and it should not delay prompt emergency surgery. As long as there are no local signs of complicated appendicitis, a single inguinal incision may be sufficient to perform appendectomy and hernia repair. In the event of complicated appendicitis, an exploratory of the abdominal cavity is mandatory, and hybrid approaches are recommended. For an experienced surgeon, the laparoscopic approach (TAPP), including the treatment of the two pathologies and the exploration of the peritoneal cavity, represents the surgical technique of choice. CONCLUSION De Garengeot's strangulated hernia with appendicitis is an exceedingly rare double surgical emergency. When uncomplicated appendicitis, a single inguinal incision is sufficient to treat both appendicitis and abdominal wall defect. Hernia reduction, which young surgeons in the emergency room commonly attempt, should be abolished.","Mejri, Atef; Omry, Ahmed; Arfaoui, Khaoula; Rchidi, Jasser",International journal of surgery case reports,473,16

It is typically conceptualized as a continuous unidimensional spectrum from morningness to eveningness. Eveningness is associated with poorer outcomes across a myriad of physical and mental health outcomes. This preference for later sleep and wake times is associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation in both clinical and community samples. However, the mechanisms underlying the negative consequences of this preference for evenings are not fully understood. Previous research has found that sleep disturbances may act as a mediator of this relationship. The present study aimed to explore the associations between chronotype and affective outcomes in a sample of students. Additionally, it aimed to investigate the potential role of insomnia as a mediator within these relationships. Participants (n = 190) completed an anonymous self-report survey of validated measures online which assessed chronotype, insomnia symptoms, and a range of affective outcomes (defeat, entrapment, suicide risk, stress, and depressive and anxious symptomology). Eveningness was associated with more severe or frequent experiences of these outcomes, with participants that demonstrated a preference for eveningness more likely to report poorer affective functioning and increased psychological distress. Mediation analysis found the relationship between chronotype and these outcome measures was completely or partially mediated by insomnia symptom severity measured by the validated Sleep Condition Indicator insomnia scale. Taken together, these findings add further evidence for the negative consequences of increased eveningness. Additionally, our results show that chronotype and sleep disturbances should be considered when assessing mental well-being. Implementing appropriate sleep-related behavior change or schedule alterations can offer a tool for mitigation or prevention of psychological distress in students that report a preference for later sleep and wake times.","Bradford, Daniel R R; Biello, Stephany M; Russell, Kirsten",Chronobiology international,473,1

An earlier randomized trial showed that rivaroxaban is no more effective than aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke after a presumed embolic stroke from an undetermined source. Whether dabigatran would be effective in preventing recurrent strokes after this type of stroke was unclear. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg or 110 mg twice daily as compared with aspirin at a dose of 100 mg once daily in patients who had had an embolic stroke of undetermined source. The primary outcome was recurrent stroke. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS A total of 5390 patients were enrolled at 564 sites and were randomly assigned to receive dabigatran (2695 patients) or aspirin (2695 patients). During a median follow-up of 19 months, recurrent strokes occurred in 177 patients (6.6%) in the dabigatran group (4.1% per year) and in 207 patients (7.7%) in the aspirin group (4.8% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 1.03; P = 0.10). Ischemic strokes occurred in 172 patients (4.0% per year) and 203 patients (4.7% per year), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.03). Major bleeding occurred in 77 patients (1.7% per year) in the dabigatran group and in 64 patients (1.4% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.66). Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 70 patients (1.6% per year) and 41 patients (0.9% per year), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In patients with a recent history of embolic stroke of undetermined source, dabigatran was not superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke. The incidence of major bleeding was not greater in the dabigatran group than in the aspirin group, but there were more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events in the dabigatran group.

ZIKV can persist in human semen and be transmitted by sexual contact, as well as by mosquitoes, as seen for classical arboviruses. We along with others have previously demonstrated that ZIKV infection leads to testis damage and infertility in mouse models. So far, no prophylactics or therapeutics are available; therefore, vaccine development is urgently demanded. Recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus has been explored as the preferred vaccine vector for many pathogens due to the low preexisting immunity against the vector among the human population. Here, we developed a ZIKV vaccine based on recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 (AdC7) expressing ZIKV M/E glycoproteins. A single vaccination of AdC7-M/E was sufficient to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against ZIKV in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. Moreover, vaccinated mice rapidly developed neutralizing antibody with high titers within 1 week postvaccination, and the elicited antiserum could cross-neutralize heterologous ZIKV strains. Additionally, ZIKV M- and E-specific T cell responses were robustly induced by AdC7-M/E. Moreover, one-dose inoculation of AdC7-M/E conferred mouse sterilizing immunity to eliminate viremia and viral burden in tissues against ZIKV challenge. Further investigations showed that vaccination with AdC7-M/E completely protected against ZIKV-induced testicular damage. These data demonstrate that AdC7-M/E is highly effective and represents a promising vaccine candidate for ZIKV control.IMPORTANCE Zika virus (ZIKV) is a pathogenic flavivirus that causes severe clinical consequences, including congenital malformations in fetuses and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Vaccine development is a high priority for ZIKV control. In this study, to avoid preexisting anti-vector immunity in humans, a rare serotype chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) expressing the ZIKV M/E glycoproteins was used for ZIKV vaccine development. Impressively, AdC7-M/E exhibited exceptional performance as a ZIKV vaccine, as follows: (i) protective efficacy by a single vaccination, (ii) rapid development of a robust humoral response, (iii) durable immune responses, (iv) robust T cell responses, and (v) sterilizing immunity achieved by a single vaccination. These advantages of AdC7-M/E strongly support its potential application as a promising ZIKV vaccine in the clinic.","Xu, Kun; Song, Yufeng; Dai, Lianpan; Zhang, Yongli; Lu, Xuancheng; Xie, Yijia; Zhang, Hangjie; Cheng, Tao; Wang, Qihui; Huang, Qingrui; Bi, Yuhai; Liu, William J; Liu, Wenjun; Li, Xiangdong; Qin, Chuan; Shi, Yi; Yan, Jinghua; Zhou, Dongming; Gao, George F",Journal of virology,473,1

Prior studies have analyzed trial termination, but it has not been easy to assess accrual estimates using international databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov because of limitations in accessing accrual information. Specifically, it is not easy to extract both anticipated and actual accrual of clinical trials. We designed a new algorithmic approach to extracting trial accrual data from ClinicalTrials.gov and used it to estimate the sufficiency of patient accrual onto genitourinary (GU) cancer trials. METHODS We queried ClinicalTrials.gov for completed/terminated phase II and III clinical trials for prostate, bladder, kidney, testicular, and ureteral cancers registered after 2007. We extracted trial characteristics from available XML files. We then used a Python algorithm to access prior trial registrations on the ClinicalTrials.gov archive site and extract both anticipated and actual accrual numbers. We then compared the actual accrual of each trial to its anticipated accrual and defined sufficient accrual as 85% of anticipated accrual. RESULTS The algorithm was 100% accurate compared with hand extraction in a small validation subset. A total of 925 trials were included, of which 840 (91%) had both anticipated and actual accrual. Only 418 (50%) trials had sufficient accrual (≥ 85% of anticipated). Considering only trials marked as successfully completed, 395/597 (66%) reached sufficient accrual.

The goal of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the pediatric population in the setting of lung protective ventilation. DESIGN A 1-yr, prospective, multicenter, observational study in 12 geographical areas of Spain (serving a population of 3.77 million ≤ 15 yrs of age) covered by 21 pediatric intensive care units. SUBJECTS All consecutive pediatric patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and meeting American-European Consensus Criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Data on ventilatory management, gas exchange, hemodynamics, and organ dysfunction were collected. A total of 146 mechanically ventilated patients fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome definition, representing a incidence of 3.9/100,000 population ≤ 15 yrs of age/yr. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. At the time of meeting acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria, mean PaO2/FIO2 was 99 mm Hg ± 41 mm Hg, mean tidal volume was 7.6 mL/kg ± 1.8 mL/kg predicted body weight, mean plateau pressure was 27 cm H2O ± 6 cm H2O, and mean positive end-expiratory pressure was 8.9 cm ± 2.9 cm H2O. Overall pediatric intensive care unit and hospital mortality were 26% (95% confidence interval 19.6-33.7) and 27.4% (95% confidence interval 20.8-35.1), respectively. At 24 hrs, after the assessment of oxygenation under standard ventilatory settings, 118 (80.8%) patients continued to meet acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria (PaO2/FIO2 104 mm Hg ± 36 mm Hg; pediatric intensive care units mortality 30.5%), whereas 28 patients (19.2%) had a PaO2/FIO2 >200 mm Hg (pediatric intensive care units mortality 7.1%) (p = .014). CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study to estimate prospectively the pediatric population-based acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and the first incidence study performed during the routine application of lung protective ventilation in children. Our findings support a lower acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and mortality than those reported for adults. PaO2/FIO2 ratios at acute respiratory distress syndrome onset and at 24 hrs after onset were helpful in defining groups at greater risk of dying (clinical trials registered with http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT 01142544).","López-Fernández, Yolanda; Azagra, Amelia Martínez-de; de la Oliva, Pedro; Modesto, Vicent; Sánchez, Juan I; Parrilla, Julio; Arroyo, María José; Reyes, Susana Beatriz; Pons-Ódena, Martí; López-Herce, Jesús; Fernández, Rosa Lidia; Kacmarek, Robert M; Villar, Jesús",Critical care medicine,473,7

The purpose of this study was to describe a transdiaphragmatic approach for subtotal pericardiectomy in dogs and to evaluate its feasibility. In total, 20 canine cadavers weighing less than 10 kg (group S) and 20 weighing more than 20 kg (group L) were used. Within each group, half underwent a subphrenic pericardiectomy via an intercostal approach and half via a transdiaphragmatic approach. For each approach and within each weight group, the percentage of resected pericardium was calculated and compared. Additionally, a case series of nine consecutive client-owned dogs that underwent a transdiaphragmatic pericardiectomy for pericardial effusion was reported. Exposure of pericardium and associated phrenic nerves was excellent in cadavers and clinical patients. In group S, the percentage of resected pericardium was not significantly different between the two approaches. In group L, on the other hand, the percentage of resected pericardium was lower with the transdiaphragmatic approach compared with the intercostal approach (P=0.001). In the clinical patients, no intraoperative complications were encountered and no recurrence of pericardial effusion was seen. Subtotal pericardiectomy via a transdiaphragmatic approach is straightforward and a safe surgical procedure to obtain permanent pericardial drainage in small and large breed dogs.","De Ridder, M; Kitshoff, A; Devriendt, N; Or, M; Rubio-Guzman, A; de Rooster, H",The Veterinary record,473,20

METHODS AND RESULTS A prospective randomized controlled trial compared selected patient outcomes in EST and cardiac CT coronary angiography groups. Five hundred patients with troponin-negative stable chest pain and without known coronary artery disease were recruited. Patients completed the Seattle Angina Questionnaires (SAQ) at baseline, 3, and 12 months to assess angina symptoms. Patients were also followed for management strategies and clinical events. Over the year 12 patients withdrew, resulting in 245 in the EST cohort and 243 in the CT cohort. There was no significant difference in baseline demographics. The CT arm had a statistical difference in angina stability and quality-of-life domains of the SAQ at 3 and12 months, suggesting less angina compared with the EST arm. In the CT arm, there was more significant disease identified and more revascularizations. Significantly, more inconclusive results were seen in the EST arm with a higher number of additional investigations ordered. There was also a longer mean time to management. There were no differences in major adverse cardiac events between the cohorts. At 1 year in the EST arm, there were more Accident and Emergency (A&E) attendances and cardiac admission. CONCLUSION Cardiac CT as an index investigation for stable chest pain improved angina symptoms and resulted in fewer investigations and re-hospitalizations compared with EST.

Students in a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine program were taught using a real-time online platform for one semester, with recorded synchronous lectures and tutorials, virtual laboratories, and clinical skills classes where possible. Students in all years of the program were surveyed twice, 8 weeks apart to assess their perceptions of online teaching and to identify challenges they experienced. Using a 10-point Likert scale, students agreed that they could achieve their learning outcomes using online learning with no more difficulty than with face-to-face teaching, allocating average scores of 7.6 and 8.2 at each time point. Students were overwhelmingly positive about the impact of online teaching on time-management of their learning due to the loss of travel time. They enjoyed aspects of teaching such as recorded lectures, online polls quizzes, and chat-boxes that allowed more student-focused learning. However, there were concerns about the reduction in face-to-face interactions including loss of classroom atmosphere and reduced interaction with peers. Students experienced technical problems in a median of 20% of lectures (range 10%-50%) at the first survey and 10% at the second (range 10%-50%). Increased use of strategies to optimize peer interactions is recommended to facilitate student learning using online platforms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with a 'baseball' suture technique, compared with 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with a standard suture method. Clinical characteristics, perioperative and follow-up data were compared between the two groups. RESULTS For the study group, compared with the standard or control group, had a significantly reduced operation time (60.15±9.97 min vs. 71.85±9.74 min) and suturing time (18.05±4.71 min vs. 28.35±3.13 min) (both p<0.05), significantly less intraoperative blood loss (93.25±19.62 ml vs. 121.50±24.87 ml) (p<0.05) and significantly less reduction in postoperative hemoglobin levels (8.9±1.97 g/L vs. 11.15±2.23 g/L) (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in duration of the use of the indwelling drainage tube, drainage volume, or time to recovery of gastrointestinal function (all, p>0.05). Following surgery, blood transfusion was given to one patient in the study group and two patients in the control group. One patient from each group had a fever. There was no significant difference in pregnancy outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS The 'baseball' suture technique for closure of the uterine incision is a safe and effective method for use in laparoscopic myomectomy.

It is not evident whether the benefits of this procedure overcome the potential increased risk. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare SILC with conventional multi-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MILC). METHODS Data from randomized, controlled trials published up to December 2011 and comparing SILC versus MILC were extracted. The primary end point was overall morbidity. A fixed-effect model was applied to summarize the study outcomes in the meta-analysis, and a random-effect model was used in the sensitivity analysis. The outcome measures were relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD); a RR of <1.0 or a negative MD indicated a more favorable outcome after SILC. Publication bias was assessed by a funnel plot, and heterogeneity was tested by the I (2) measure and subgroup analyses. RESULTS A total of 12 trials (996 patients) were included. Mortality was nil in both treatment groups; the overall RR for morbidity was 1.36 (p = 0.098). The mean operating time was 47.2 min for MILC and 58.1 min for SILC (MD 9.47 min; p < 0.001). The visual analog scale pain score at 24 h after surgery was 2.96 in MILC and 2.34 in SILC (MD -0.64; p = 0.058), but sensitivity analysis of the four studies deemed at low risk of bias for pain assessment, according to blinding and postoperative analgesic protocols, showed significance at -0.43 points (95 % confidence interval -0.87 to 0.00; p = 0.049). Cosmetic outcome scored better in the SILC group, with its standardized MD being equal to 1.16 (95 % confidence interval 0.57 to 1.75; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In selected patients, SILC has similar overall morbidity compared with MILC; further, it results in better cosmetic satisfaction and reduced postoperative pain despite longer operative time.","Arezzo, Alberto; Scozzari, Gitana; Famiglietti, Federico; Passera, Roberto; Morino, Mario",Surgical endoscopy,473,29

We conducted a systematic review of SDM trials in patients considering knee arthroplasty (KA) to characterize how SDM was supported and the impact on care received. METHODS We searched multiple bibliographic databases from inception to December 31, 2019. A pair of reviewers working independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated each trial's risk of bias. RESULTS We found 6 eligible randomized trials (4 included KA and hip arthroplasty), all of which tested the same proprietary decision aid (DA) (Treatment Choices for Hip or Knee Osteoarthritis) with some adding other materials to support SDM. These trials, all of which had moderate to high risk of bias, focused on assessing the effect of the DA on patient knowledge about the options, while not explicitly supporting other aspects of SDM such as choice awareness, deliberation, or decision-making. One trial found an increase in the number of African Americans undergoing KA in the 12 months following the intervention. No other trials found that SDMs impact clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Evidence for SDM in patients considering KA is mostly limited to a single DA. While use of this decision aid improves patient knowledge about their treatment options, this tool has not been shown to promote SDM, impact treatment decisions or satisfaction with care. Future work should seek to support SDM directly, and assess effects on treatment decisions, functional outcomes, and satisfaction.","Riddle, Daniel L; Sando, Trisha; Tarver, Talicia; Slover, James; Sierra, Rafael J; Brito, Juan P; Montori, Victor M",Arthritis care & research,473,31

Sp2CBMTD is a genetically engineered multivalent protein that masks sialic acid-containing cellular receptors on the respiratory epithelium, which are recognized by influenza viruses. Here, we evaluated the antiviral potential of Sp2CBMTD against lethal infection in mice with an emerging A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus and addressed the mechanistic basis of its activity in vivo. Sp2CBMTD was administered to mice intranasally as a single or repeated dose (0.1, 1, 10, or 100 μg) before (day -7, -3, and/or -1) or after (6 or 24 h) H7N9 virus inoculation. A single Sp2CBMTD dose (10 or 100 μg) protected 80% to 100% of the mice when administered 7 days before the H7N9 lethal challenge. Repeated Sp2CBMTD administration conferred the highest protection, resulting in 100% survival of the mice even at the lowest dose tested (0.1 μg). When treatment began 24 h after exposure to the H7N9 virus, a single administration of 100 μg of Sp2CBMTD protected 40% of the mice from death. The administration of Sp2CBMTD induced the pulmonary expression of proinflammatory mediators (interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-1β, RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 [MCP-1], macrophage inflammatory protein-1α [MIP-1α], and inducible protein [IP-10]) and recruited neutrophils to the respiratory tract before H7N9 virus infection, which resulted in less pronounced inflammation and rapid virus clearance from mouse lungs. Sp2CBMTD administration did not affect the virus-specific adaptive immune response, which was sufficient to protect against reinfection with a higher dose of homologous H7N9 virus or heterologous H5N1 virus. Thus, Sp2CBMTD was effective in preventing H7N9 infections in a lethal mouse model and holds promise as a prophylaxis option against zoonotic influenza viruses.","Govorkova, Elena A; Baranovich, Tatiana; Marathe, Bindumadhav M; Yang, Lei; Taylor, Margaret A; Webster, Robert G; Taylor, Garry L; Connaris, Helen",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,473,1

During August-October 2018, the largest U.S. psittacosis outbreak in 30 years (82 cases identified*) occurred in two poultry slaughter plants, one each in Virginia and Georgia, that shared source farms (2). CDC used C. psittaci real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test 54 human specimens from this outbreak. This was the largest number of human specimens from a single outbreak ever tested for C. psittaci using real-time PCR, which is faster and more sensitive than commercially available serologic tests. This represented a rare opportunity to assess the utility of multiple specimen types for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. C. psittaci was detected more frequently in lower respiratory specimens (59% [10 of 17]) and stool (four of five) than in upper respiratory specimens (7% [two of 28]). Among six patients with sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs tested, C. psittaci was detected only in sputum in five patients.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to understand the timeline of protease activity in the soft tissues of the shoulder (tendon, muscle, and cartilage) that may lead to down-stream degeneration following rotator cuff tear. A well-established rat model involving suprascapular nerve denervation and supraspinatus/infraspinatus tendon transection was employed. Histological staining and/or micro-computed tomography (µCT) were used to observe structural damage in the supraspinatus tendon and muscle, humeral head cartilage, and subchondral bone. Multiplex gelatin zymography was utilized to assess protease activity in the supraspinatus tendon and muscle, and humeral head cartilage. Zymography analysis demonstrated that cathepsins were upregulated in the first week in all tissues, while MMP-2 maintained prolonged activity in supraspinatus tendon between 1 and 3 weeks and increased only at 3 weeks in supraspinatus muscle. In supraspinatus tendon, increased cathepsin L and MMP-2 activity in the first week was concurrent with matrix disorganization and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In contrast, significant upregulation of cathepsin L and K activity in supraspinatus muscle and humeral head cartilage did not correspond to any visible tissue damage at 1 week.

The primary endpoint was time to intubation, with secondary endpoints of success rate, perceived difficulty and preferred technique. We also investigated the relationship between level of training and prior training and experience with the techniques on the primary outcome. The mean (95% CI) time to intubation using a direct tracheal tube technique of 37 (31-42) s was significantly shorter than either the Aintree intubation catheter technique at 70 (60-80) s, or a guidewire technique at 126 (110-141) s (p < 0.001).

The score of social functioning increased to 60.4 from 52.6 (p < 0.03) and general health perception increased to 75.1 from 60.5 (p < 0.04) at 6-month follow-up. The two STAI sub-scores, the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and the Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) were found high (≥ 40) both preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Postoperatively there was no significant decrease of the levels of anxiety. Conclusions This study suggests that the assessment of psychosocial factors, particularly the ongoing assessment of anxiety, could help in risk stratification and prediction of functional status in patients suffering from lower extremity peripheral arterial occlusive disease.","Guzelhan, Yalcin; Oztas, Didem Melis; Conkbayir, Cenk; Rodoplu, Orhan; Erdinc, Ibrahim; Canbay, Cagla; Ugurlucan, Murat; Alpagut, Ufuk; Bozbuga, Nilgun",Archives of medical sciences.

Recent studies have discussed the fact that the presence of T. gondii cysts in the brain and the resulting biochemical and immunological mechanisms could be linked to neurobehavioral disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity in OSA obese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A case control study on obese patients screened for OSA was performed. According to the sleep disorder and matched based on gender, age and body mass index (BMI), two groups of obese patients were selected from our sample collection database. All patients were tested for toxoplasmosis serological status measuring anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM levels. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess the impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and OSA severity. RESULTS 107 obese patients suffering from OSA were included in the study (median age: 53.3 years Interquartile range (IQR): [41.9-59.9]; median BMI: 39.4 kg/m2 IQR: [35.5-44.1], apnea-hypopnea index = 27.5 events/h [10.7-49.9]). Chronic toxoplasmosis was present in 63.4% and 70.7% of patients with or without sleepiness (p = 0.48), respectively and was not associated either to sleepiness (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: [0.52; 2.33], p = 0.64) or OSA severity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: [0.51; 5.98] p = 0.37). CONCLUSION Although chronic Toxoplasma infection in immunocompetent humans has been associated to several behavioral disorders or pathologies in recent literature, we demonstrate here that chronic toxoplasmosis is not associated to sleepiness and to sleep apnea syndrome severity in obese patients suspected of sleep apnea syndrome.","Dard, Céline; Bailly, Sébastien; Pépin, Jean-Louis; Brenier-Pinchart, Marie-Pierre; Fricker-Hidalgo, Hélène; Peeters, Marie; Pelloux, Hervé; Tamisier, Renaud",PloS one,473,16

Emergence of avoidance conditioning in rat pups is triggered by elevated plasma corticosterone activating the amygdala. Further, the mother's ability to buffer the corticosterone response delays the onset of avoidance in ˜2-week-old pups. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) also develops during the pre-weaning period. In previous work, little or no conditioning was observed on Day 17 for pups housed in the home cage with mother and littermates between training sessions, whereas pups isolated between training sessions did show some conditioning. This suggests that social buffering may also delay the onset of this form of aversive learning. In the present study with Day-17 pups, one session of periorbital shock, the typical EBC unconditioned stimulus for young rat pups, resulted in lower plasma corticosterone levels and neural activity in the central nucleus of the amygdale (CeA) of pups returned to the mother and homecage following the session as compared to pups isolated following the shock session. These findings demonstrate social buffering of the physiological response to aversive stimulus exposure under conditions of EBC and support the hypothesis that social buffering of early adverse experience may adjust the timing of emergence of EBC in rat pups.

Failure of aneurysm occlusion may be caused by residual flow maintaining patency of the jailed branch along with the aneurysm. Our aim was to test whether endovascular occlusion of the jailed branch could improve efficacy of flow diversion of bifurcation aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen wide-necked lingual-carotid artery bifurcation aneurysms were created in eight canines. Patent aneurysms were randomly allocated 4 weeks later to flow diversion combined with jailed branch occlusion using coils and/or Onyx (n=6) or flow diversion alone (n=8). Angiographic results of aneurysm occlusion at 3 months were scored using an ordinal scale. Pathology specimens were photographed and neointimal coverage estimated using a semiquantitative scoring system. RESULTS Fourteen aneurysms were patent at 1 month. FD deployment was successful in all cases but, at 3-month follow-up, three devices had prolapsed into the aneurysm. None of the bifurcation aneurysms treated with FD alone were occluded at 3 months. Endovascular branch occlusion combined with flow diversion significantly improved aneurysm occlusion rates compared with flow diversion alone (median angiographic scores 2 vs 0: p=0.0137). Flow-limiting parent vessel stenosis was not observed in any arteries. Devices were covered with thick neointima in most cases, but patent aneurysms were associated with leaks or holes in the neointima covering the aneurysm neck. CONCLUSIONS Treatment failures following flow diversion of bifurcation aneurysms can be caused by persistent flow to the jailed branch. Branch occlusion combined with flow diversion may improve angiographic occlusion scores of a canine bifurcation aneurysm model.","Fahed, R; Gentric, J C; Salazkin, I; Gevry, G; Raymond, J; Darsaut, T E",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,473,1

However, the significantly high periprocedural mortality and complication rates still limit the indications of BAV. Further efforts are needed to improve the safety and efficacy of BAV.Methods and Results:We retrospectively investigated the safety and efficacy of simultaneous biplane mode of 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (biplane-TEE) guided antegrade transseptal multiple-inflation BAV, with gradual upsizing of the balloon, by enrolling 20 consecutive AS patients who underwent BAV. The median age was 83 years, and there were 6 male patients (30.0%). The clinical frailty scale was 4, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeon score was 14.5%. The balloon was inflated at a median of 18 times, which improved the mean aortic valve pressure gradient from 43.0 to 15.2 mmHg (P<0.001). We safely performed BAV in all patients, without periprocedural death or symptomatic stroke, although asymptomatic stroke was detected in 8 patients (42.1%) on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed that the survival rate was 84.0% and cardiovascular death-free survival was 88.9% at 1-year. CONCLUSIONS Biplane-TEE guided antegrade multiple-inflation BAV might have the potential to improve periprocedural survival without increasing complications, compared with conventional retrograde BAV in patients with severe AS.","Mizutani, Kazuki; Hara, Masahiko; Ishikawa, Hirotoshi; Nishimura, Shinsuke; Ito, Asahiro; Iwata, Shinichi; Takahashi, Yosuke; Sugioka, Kenichi; Murakami, Takashi; Shibata, Toshihiko; Yoshiyama, Minoru",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,473,16

However, real-world use of colonoscopy in older populations is rarely evaluated using Korean databases. METHODS We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of individuals aged over 20 years between 2012 and 2017. We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment-National Patient Samples database, previously converted to the standardized Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model. The use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy was evaluated, stratified by age group and sex. RESULTS During the study period, we captured data from the database on 240,406 patients who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy and 88,984 who underwent colonoscopic polypectomy. During the study period, use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy steadily increased, but both procedures were most significantly increased in the 65- to 85-year group compared to other age groups (p < 0.05). Average ages for both procedures significantly increased in the most recent 3 years (p < 0.05). Polypectomy rates for men plateaued in the 50- to 64-year age group, but rates for women steadily increased up to the 65- to 85-year group. Polypectomy rates were higher for men than for women in all index years. CONCLUSIONS The use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy significantly increased in the 65- to 85-year age group. Our findings suggest that more available colonoscopy resources should be allocated to older populations, considering the aging society in Asian countries.","Kim, Ha Il; Yoon, Jin Young; Kwak, Min Seob; Cha, Jae Myung",Digestive diseases and sciences,473,19

Little is known about the influence of age, gender and race, and interindividual variability of human FcRn and β2M on the protein level. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry (MS)-based targeted quantitative proteomic method was developed and optimized for the quantification of human FcRn and β2M. Among the 39 human livers studied (age 13 - 80 years), the mean ({plus minus} S.D.) concentrations of FcRn and β2M were 147 ({plus minus} 39) and 1250 ({plus minus} 460) pmol/g of liver tissue, respectively. A four-fold interindividual variability (63 - 243 pmol/g of liver tissue) was observed for the hepatic FcRn concentration. A moderate correlation was found between the hepatic β2M and FcRn expression levels. Influences of age, gender and race on the hepatic expression of FcRn and β2M were evaluated. The findings from this study may aid the development of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models that incorporate empirical FcRn tissue concentrations and interindividual variabilities, and the development of personalized dosing of biopharmaceuticals. Significance Statement This is the first study to evaluate the influence of age, gender and race on the expression of FcRn and β2M and their interindividual variability in human livers. This study describes a validated UPLC-MRM-based targeted quantitative proteomic method for quantifying human FcRn and β2M in biological tissues. Results from this study may aid current development of PBPK models for biotherapeutics, where FcRn plays a significant role in clearance mechanism and its expression level and interindividual variability are largely unknown.","Qiu, Xiazi; Wang, Michael Zhuo",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,473,23

The negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been shown to be safe and can increase the chance for early fascial closure in trauma or septic patients. However, little data are available on the specific setting of LT. We aimed to report our experience of OA after LT, marked by the recent use of NPWT. METHODS All patients with postponed wall closure after LT, from 2002 to 2014, in a single institution were included and retrospectively analyzed. Our management of OA after LT has shifted from skin-only closure (SOC) followed by abdominal wall reconstruction at a distance to the use of NPWT with early fascial closure. RESULTS Of the 1559 LTs performed during the study period, immediate abdominal wall closure at the end of transplantation could not be achieved in 46 (2.9%) patients. Of them, SOC was performed in 22 (47.8%) patients, whereas vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy was used in 24 (52.1%) patients. The comprehensive complication indexes (CCI) were similar [CCI: 66 (0-100) in the SOC group vs. 56 (0-100) in the VAC group; p = 0.55]. No evisceration or fistula occurred in both groups. One (4.2%) postoperative bleeding case was reported in the VAC group. Early fascial closure was achieved within a median of 5.5 days (1-12) for the 24 patients (100%) of the VAC group. In four of them, a biological mesh was necessary. Only nine patients (52.9%) of the survivors in the SOC group underwent abdominal reconstruction. CONCLUSION The NPWT in patients with OA after LT enables early fascial closure with limited morbidity provided a specific attention is given to the risk of bleeding. These results support the use of NPWT as the first option in OA patients after LT.","Hobeika, Christian; Allard, Marc-Antoine; Bucur, Petru-Octav; Naili, Salima; Sa Cunha, Antonio; Cherqui, Daniel; Castaing, Denis; Adam, René; Vibert, Eric",World journal of surgery,473,1

This study evaluates the metabolic response of Actinobacillus succinogenes for the production of succinic acid using spent sulphite liquor (SSL) as feedstock derived from industrial acidic sulphite pulping of Eucalyptus globulus hardwood. A transcriptomic approach led to significant insights on gene regulation of the major metabolic pathways (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation) in batch cultures carried out on SSL and compared with glucose and xylose. Significantly overexpressed genes in SSL compared to glucose and xylose were fructose biphosphate aldolase (> 1.18-fold change) in the catabolism, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (> 1.59-fold change) and malate dehydrogenase (> 1.49-fold change) in the TCA cycle, citrate lyase (> 1.7-fold change), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (> 0.88-fold change), pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 (> 1.63-fold change) and pyruvate formate lyase (> 0.61-fold change), involved in acetyl-CoA pathways. Finally, C4 tricarboxylic transporters were overexpressed (DCU (> 1.61-fold change) and 0079 (> 4.19-fold change).

METHODS Asthma and healthy control subjects were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between February 2012 and February 2013. Nasal swabs were collected, and respiratory viruses were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All patients completed questionnaires and a lung function test. Some were followed up for 4 weeks, and symptom changes were evaluated via asthma diaries. RESULTS In total, 70 patients with acute asthma exacerbations were recruited. Among them, 34 patients (48.6%) completed the 4-week follow-up study. Another 65 patients with stable asthma and 134 healthy volunteers were also included in this study. The rate of positive viral detection via PCR in acute asthma exacerbation patients was 34.2% (24/70), which is significantly higher than that of stable asthma (12/65; 18.5%; P=0.038) and normal control patients (18/134; 13.4%; P<0.001). Among the viral-positive subjects, the number of viral copies was significantly higher in acute asthma exacerbation patients [(5.00±4.63) ×10(7) copies/L] (mean ± SD) than those in stable asthma patients [(1.24±1.44) ×10(6) copies/L; P<0.001] or in healthy controls [(1.44±0.44) ×10(6) copies/L; P<0.001], whose viral loads were not significantly different from one another (P=0.774). During the 4-week follow-up period, the cough scores on days 1 and 3 were significantly higher in the viral-positive group than in the viral-negative group (day 1: P=0.016; day 3: P=0.004). However, there were no significant differences between these two groups for other tested symptoms, such as dyspnea and total recovery time (P>0.05).

DESIGN cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS using a new information system developed during the pandemic, we gathered data on the number of daily deaths in the population residing in the provinces of Milan and Lodi by Local Health Unit (ASST) and age groups. To describe the case fatality of COVID-19, we performed a record linkage with a database specially constructed during the epidemic to identify deaths that occurred in confirmed cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES mortality and excess mortality were analysed by comparing the number of observed deaths in the first 4 months of 2020 with the average deaths of the years 2016-2019 in the same calendar period and with expected deaths, estimated using a Poisson model. Furthermore, a measure of relative risk was calculated as observed/expected ratio with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS the increase in mortality for all causes occurring in the study population in the first 4 months of 2020 was 48.8%, 30.8% for ages between 60 and 69, 43.9% for ages between 70 and 79, and 56.7% for subjects above 80 years of age. Focusing on the epidemic period, from 1 March to 30 April, the excess is quantifiable as more than 2-fold and mainly concerns the population over 60 years of age. The excess mortality was observed in all local health units (ASSTs). The highest increments were in the province of Lodi and the North-East of Milan (ASST Nord). In the ASSTs of Lodi and Melegnano-Martesana the mortality excess was detectable from March 15th, while for the other ASSTs the increase began in the first week of April. CONCLUSIONS evaluation of overall mortality in the provinces of Milan and Lodi during the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic showed a significant excess compared to the first 4 months of the years 2016-2019, mainly in the population over 60 years of age. However, this excess cannot be completely attributed directly to COVID-19 itself.

To determine pharmacy students' preferences for and perceptions of in-person and video evaluations.Methods. A mixed methods survey was administered to 447 first-, second-, and third-year students enrolled in a public US Doctor of Pharmacy program. A survey instrument with 14 quantitative items and four qualitative items was used to measure student perceptions. Eight response choice items measured preferences. Paired t tests were used to compare students' perceptions. Independent t tests were used to compare perceptions between students who experienced and had not experienced video evaluations. Two researchers performed thematic content analysis of the qualitative responses.Results. Students (n=444, 99.3% response rate) perceived in-person evaluations more positively for all items except nervousness. Students who experienced video technology felt significantly more positive about video evaluations than students who had little or no experience using video technology on nine items. The students who experienced video technology felt significantly less positive toward video evaluations in terms of quality (1.24 vs. 0.83) and amount (1.14 vs 0.77) of written feedback. Although students valued the interaction with a larger, more diverse pool of evaluators that was made possible by video evaluations, they did not view video technology as applicable to their future practice.Conclusion. Students viewed in-person evaluations significantly more positively than video evaluations.

Donor-transmitted viral infections are uncommon but in recent years have brought to light the clinical manifestations of rabies, West Nile virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in the early posttransplant period. Later posttransplant, infection with viruses circulating in the community can occur with a number of pathogens, including some vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles and mumps. Recent advances in molecular microbiology have made it possible to diagnose a growing number of community-acquired viral pathogens infecting transplant recipients. This article reviews some of the emerging and reemerging viral pathogens infecting solid organ and hematopoietic stem-cell recipients, including adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, human herpesvirus-6, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, measles, mumps, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and West Nile virus.","Fischer, Staci A",Transplantation,473,1

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have been used to predict CKD effects on transporter-mediated renal active secretion and CLr for hydrophilic nonpermeable compounds. However, no studies have shown systematic PBPK modeling of renal passive reabsorption or CLr for hydrophobic permeable drugs in CKD. The goal of this study was to expand our previously developed and verified mechanistic kidney model to develop a universal model to predict changes in CLr in CKD for permeable and nonpermeable drugs that accounts for the dramatic nonlinear effect of CKD on renal passive reabsorption of permeable drugs. The developed model incorporates physiologically-based tubular changes of reduced water reabsorption/increased tubular flow rate per remaining functional nephron in CKD. The final adaptive kidney model successfully (absolute fold error (AFE) all < 2) predicted renal passive reabsorption and CLr for 20 permeable and nonpermeable test compounds across the stages of CKD. In contrast, use of proportional glomerular filtration rate reduction approach without addressing tubular adaptation processes in CKD to predict CLr generated unacceptable CLr predictions (AFE = 2.61-7.35) for permeable compounds in severe CKD. Finally, the adaptive kidney model accurately predicted CLr of para-amino-hippuric acid and memantine, two secreted compounds, in CKD, suggesting successful integration of active secretion into the model, along with passive reabsorption. In conclusion, the developed adaptive kidney model enables mechanistic predictions of in vivo CLr through CKD progression without any empirical scaling factors and can be used for CLr predictions prior to assessment of drug disposition in renal impairment.","Huang, Weize; Isoherranen, Nina",CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology,473,24

In addition to establishing the exact criteria regarding whether treatment for a newly arriving patient shows a sufficient likelihood of success, it is also necessary to ask whether patients already undergoing treatment whose prospects are low should be moved into palliative care if new patients with better prospects arrive. This question has led to divergent ethical guidelines. This paper explores the distinction between withholding and withdrawing medical treatment during times of scarcity. As a first central point, the paper argues that a revival of the ethical distinction between doing and allowing would have a revisionary impact on cases of voluntary treatment withdrawal. A second systematic focus lies in the concern that withdrawal due to scarcity might be considered a physical transgression and therefore more problematic than not treating someone in the first place. In light of the persistent disagreement, especially concerning the second issue, the paper concludes with two pragmatic proposals for how to handle the ethical uncertainty: (1) triage protocols should explicitly require that intensive care attempts are designed as time-limited trials based on specified treatment goals, and this intent should be documented very clearly at the beginning of each treatment; and (2) lower survival prospects can be accepted for treatments that have already begun, compared with the respective triage rules for the initial access of patients to intensive care.","Dufner, Annette",Bioethics,473,1

METHODS In total, 174 cats presenting with vestibular syndrome between January 2010 and May 2019 were investigated. Univariate statistical analysis of clinical variables was performed and those statistically associated with a diagnosis were retained for multivariable binary logistic regression modelling. RESULTS The seven most prevalent diagnoses represented 95% of vestibular presentations, which included: otitis media/interna (n = 48), idiopathic vestibular syndrome (n = 39), intracranial neoplasia (n = 24), middle ear polyp (n = 17), feline infectious peritonitis (n = 13), thiamine deficiency (n = 13) and intracranial empyema (n = 11). Idiopathic vestibular syndrome was commonly associated with non-purebred cats and had 17.8 times the odds of an improving clinical progression (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-250.0; P = 0.03). Intracranial neoplasia was associated with older age and chronic onset of clinical signs, and was significantly more likely to have a central vestibular neuroanatomical localisation (95% CI 8.5-344349142.0; P = 0.015) with postural deficits on neurological examination. Thiamine deficiency was more common in female cats, with 52.6 times the odds of a waxing and waning clinical progression (95% CI 1.2-1000; P = 0.038) and 6.8 times the odds of presenting with bilateral vestibular signs (95% CI 1.0-45.7; P = 0.047) and wide excursions of the head (95% CI 1.0-45.7; P = 0.047). Middle ear polyps were associated with 8.8 times the odds of presenting with Horner syndrome (95% CI 1.5-50.0; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although it may be difficult to identify the underlying diagnosis in cats with vestibular syndrome from the presenting features alone, there are instances in which discrete clinical features may help to guide clinical reasoning when evaluating cats with vestibular presentations.","Grapes, Nicholas J; Taylor-Brown, Frances E; Volk, Holger A; De Decker, Steven",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,473,19

In this paper, a deployment model was developed based on geometrical properties of braided stents. The proposed mathematical description is first applied on idealized toroidal vessels demonstrating the stent shortening in curved vessels. It is subsequently generalized to patient specific vasculature predicting the position of the filaments along with the length and local porosity of the stent. In parallel, in-vitro and in-vivo FDS deployments were measured by contrast-enhanced cone beam CT (CBCT) in idealized and patient-specific geometries. These measurements showed a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the virtual deployments and provided experimental validations of the underlying geometrical assumptions. In particular, they highlighted the importance of the stent radius assessment in the accuracy of the deployment prediction. Thanks to its low computational cost, the proposed model is potentially implementable in clinical practice providing critical information for patient safety and treatment outcome assessment.","Bouillot, Pierre; Brina, Olivier; Ouared, Rafik; Yilmaz, Hasan; Farhat, Mohamed; Erceg, Gorislav; Lovblad, Karl-Olof; Vargas, Maria Isabel; Kulcsar, Zsolt; Pereira, Vitor Mendes",Medical image analysis,473,26

Infected patients occasionally present with various symptoms resembling Kawasaki disease; thus discriminating the two in the acute phase is challenging. In addition to bacterial culture and serology, novel detection methods based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are reported in the literature. However, the clinical utility of LAMP-based methods in comparison with the other methods is scarcely documented in the literature. AIM To clarify the clinical utility of a LAMP-based method in the diagnosis of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection. METHODOLOGY Inpatients admitted due to suspected Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection during April 2008 through March 2015 were enrolled. Results of the LAMP-based method as well as culture and serology were collected and compared. RESULTS Among 16 eligible cases, serology proved positive in 13 (81.3 %) cases, LAMP in eight (50 %) cases, and bacterial culture in four (25 %) cases. No significant difference among the three methods could be proved statistically. Although serology was the most sensitive method, it is known to miss cases such as young patients, whereas LAMP could complement all three cases missed by serology. Furthermore, LAMP can return the test result within a few hours from specimen receipt, whereas serology and bacterial culture requires days to weeks of time. CONCLUSION Although second to serology in sensitivity, the LAMP-based method proved its utility in making rapid diagnosis, and serving a complementary role to serology.","Kato, Atsushi; Miyata, Ippei; Tanaka, Yuhei; Oishi, Tomohiro; Teranishi, Hideto; Akaike, Hiroto; Ohno, Naoki; Nakajima, Hiroshi; Kouguchi, Yutaka; Ouchi, Kazunobu",Journal of medical microbiology,473,1

We report our clinical experiences of TAMIS for rectal neuroendocrine tumors to evaluate the feasibility and safety. METHODS Between December 2010 and March 2020, the 25 consecutive patients with rectal neoplasma underwent the TAMIS procedure performed by single laparoscopic surgeon at the two hospitals. Of these, ten patients with rectal neuroendocrine tumors were reviewed retrospectively. The full-thickness excision down to the outer fatty tissues was completed using TAMIS technique. Clinicopathological findings, perioperative and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS TAMIS for small rNET was successfully completed in all cases. There were seven cases with a tumor size of less than 10 mm, and three cases with a tumor size between 10 and 15 mm. Six patients underwent the primary tumor excision; the remaining four patients underwent resection for the scar after endoscopic procedure. The median surgical duration was 80.5 (53-124) minutes and the median blood loss was 1 (1-12) ml. All removed tumors in the 6 primary excisions were diagnosed as neuroendocrine tumor G1. The margins of specimens were completely free in all cases. Among the four patients after endoscopic procedure, all had no histological evidence of residual tumor. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days postoperatively. There was no post-operative mortality or severe complication. The median length of observation was 54 months. No recurrence, no local or distant metastasis and no mortality of all patients were observed. CONCLUSIONS TAMIS is safety and feasible procedure for small rNET. Further experience and clinical trials are needed to fully define the advantages, disadvantages, and indications of TAMIS for rNET.","Hayashi, Shigeoki; Takayama, Tadatoshi; Ikarashi, Masahito; Hagiwara, Ken; Matsuno, Yoritaka; Suzuki, Takeki",Surgical endoscopy,473,16

PICO™, a no canister single-use system offers a lightweight, portable alternative to traditional negative pressure wound therapy, with improved clinical performance. The aim of this study was to determine the potential mechanism(s) of action of single-use negative pressure wound therapy versus traditional negative pressure wound therapy. Approach: Single-use negative pressure wound therapy and traditional negative pressure wound therapy were applied to an in vivo porcine excisional wound model, following product use guidelines. Macroscopic, histological and biochemical analyses were performed at defined healing time-points to assess multiple aspects of the healing response. Results: Wounds treated with single-use negative pressure displayed greater wound closure and increased re-epithelialisation versus those treated with traditional negative pressure. The resulting granulation tissue was more advanced with fewer neutrophils, reduced inflammatory markers, more mature collagen and no wound filler-associated foreign body reactions. Of note, single-use negative pressure therapy failed to induce wound edge epithelial hyperproliferation, while traditional negative pressure therapy compromised peri-wound skin, which remained inflamed with high transepidermal water loss; features not observed following single-use treatment. Innovation: Single-use negative pressure was identified to improve multiple aspects of healing versus traditional negative pressure treatment. Conclusion: This study provides important new insight into the differing mode of action of single-use versus traditional negative pressure and may go some way to explaining the improved clinical outcomes observed with single use negative pressure therapy.","Brownhill, Varuni R; Huddleston, Elizabeth; Bell, Andrea; Hart, Jeffrey; Webster, Iain; Hardman, Matthew; Wilkinson, Holly Nicola",Advances in wound care,473,1

RECENT FINDINGS ALD has recently become the most common indication for liver transplantation due to the increasing prevalence of AUD and the paucity of therapeutic options. There is broad consensus on the importance of early identification of AUD and the incorporation of its treatment in the management of ALD. New targets for treatment of alcoholic hepatitis include the gut-liver axis, anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants, and drugs with hepatic regenerative potential. Fecal transplantation in particular has had favorable outcomes at 1 year. n-Acetylcysteine in addition to corticosteroids, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and IL-22 have also shown improved short-term outcomes. A number of other therapies are being studied in clinical trials and their results are anxiously awaited. SUMMARY In summary, there are several promising therapeutic options under clinical investigation for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis and ALD; however, alcohol abstinence is key. In the absence of other effective therapies, liver transplantation for ALD remains a life-saving treatment with excellent patient and graft survival.","German, Margarita N; Musto, Jessica; Lucey, Michael R",Current opinion in gastroenterology,473,16

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, limited these in-person opportunities. Therefore, we hypothesized that applicants of the 2021 cycle would be more likely to match into programs with which they have existing geographic connections when compared to previous years. DESIGN Residency websites and social media accounts were searched for resident names and educational information for those matching in 2021 and 2015 to 2020. Outcomes included proportion of applicants matching at the program affiliated with their medical school (""home program""), or matching in the same state or United States Census Map region as their medical school or undergraduate institution. Subgroup analyses were stratified by program region, incoming resident class size, and Doximity residency reputation ranking. SETTING Columbia University (New York). PARTICIPANTS For the 2015 to 2020 residency cycles, 963 residents were identified from 78 (95.1%) programs. For 2021, 159 incoming interns were identified from 70 (82.3%) programs. RESULTS 2021 applicants matched into their home program at higher rates than 2015-2020 applicants (36.0% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.019). This trend was similar regardless of program region or size. This increase was significant for programs ranked outside of the top 30 (41.5% vs. 26.4%, p = 0.032), but not for the top 30 programs (32.1% vs. 22.3%, p = 0.128). Excluding those who matched at their home program, 2015 to 2020 and 2021 applicants matched in the same state or region of their medical school or undergraduate institution at similar rates (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, plastic surgery residency programs matched more applicants from affiliated medical schools than in previous years. This may result from lack of in-person opportunities for applicants at other programs. Alternative relationship-building opportunities may facilitate broader geographic connections in the 2022 cycle.","Asadourian, Paul A; Murphy, Alexander I; Marano, Andrew A; Rohde, Christine H; Wu, June K",Journal of surgical education,473,1

These ranged from complications such as bowel injuries and haemorrhage to gynaecological surgeries in complicated patients, and obstetric patients with placenta accreta and intra-operative diagnosis of unexpected malignancy. CONCLUSION The role of the gynaecologic oncologist within a tertiary centre is expanding to include the provision of support to general gynaecologists and obstetricians. There is increasing utilisation of the gynaecologic oncologist whereby their attendance is often pre-arranged prior to the surgery. However, emergency cases requiring their assistance are not uncommon.","Acton, Jade; Leung, Yee; Tan, Jason; Salfinger, Stuart",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,473,17

This study aimed to examine the expression of mTOR pathway genes in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine, which is considered an mTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer. METHODS Thirty-two patients with acute schizophrenia who had been treated with olanzapine for four weeks (average dose 14.24 ± 4.35 mg/d) and 32 healthy volunteers were recruited. Before and after olanzapine treatment, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to evaluate the symptoms of patients with schizophrenia, and the mRNA expression levels of mTOR pathway-related genes, including MTOR, RICTOR, RAPTOR, and DEPTOR, were detected in fasting venous blood samples from all subjects using real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS The MTOR and RICTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia were significantly decreased compared with those of healthy controls and further significantly decreased after four weeks of olanzapine treatment. The DEPTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia were not significantly different from those of healthy controls but were significantly increased after treatment. The expression levels of the RAPTOR mRNA were not significantly different among the three groups. The pairwise correlations of MTOR, DEPTOR, RAPTOR, and RICTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia and healthy controls were significant. After olanzapine treatment, the correlations between the expression levels of the DEPTOR and MTOR mRNAs and between the DEPTOR and RICTOR mRNAs disappeared. CONCLUSIONS Abnormalities in the mTOR pathway, especially DEPTOR and mTORC2, might play important roles in the autophagy mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and effects of olanzapine treatment.","Cui, Fengwei; Gu, Shuguang; Gu, Yue; Yin, Jiajun; Fang, Chunxia; Liu, Liang",BMC psychiatry,473,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively studied 50 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with porcine grafts of small intestinal submucosa (21) or dermal collagen (29). We compared these patients to 100 consecutive controls in whom polypropylene was used, and underwent surgery before (50) or after (50) the cases. The primary outcome was anatomical cure (stage I or less at any compartment). Secondary outcomes were graft related complications, subjective cure and quality of life evaluated by clinical examination, standardized interview and prolapse specific questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS At study closure 129 (86%) patients were available for functional evaluation and 104 (67%) were available for anatomical evaluation. Mean postoperative followup (+/-33 months) and baseline characteristics except age were comparable. The overall anatomical failure rate was comparable (49% vs 34%, p = 0.053) but failures at the vault (21% vs 3%, p <0.01) and posterior compartment (36% vs 19%, p <0.05) were more frequent in the xenograft group. There were 6 reoperations including secondary laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (5) and cystocele repair (1), all confined to the xenograft group (p <0.01). Graft related complications were equally frequent (11%) in the xenograft and polypropylene groups. The reoperation rate for graft related complications was not different (xenograft 3% vs controls 11%, p = 0.20). There were no differences in functional outcome and quality of life between xenografts and controls. CONCLUSIONS While overall anatomical failure was comparable, sacrocolpopexy using xenograft was associated with more apical failures and reoperations for prolapse than with polypropylene without differences in functional outcome. The use of xenografts did not decrease the number of graft related complications.","Deprest, Jan; De Ridder, Dirk; Roovers, Jan-Paul; Werbrouck, Erika; Coremans, Georges; Claerhout, Filip",The Journal of urology,473,7

Rotation of the head can affect the cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube. We investigated the change in cuff pressure and the degree of tube displacement according to the direction of head rotation (toward the same side vs opposite side of tube fixation) using a TaperGuard endotracheal tube. METHODS We conducted a prospective study in 58 patients, aged 18 to 70 years, who underwent tympanomastoidectomy under general anesthesia. TaperGuard endotracheal tube was secured at the corner of the mouth, either on the same side as that of the head rotation (Group S, n = 29) or on the opposite side (Group O, n = 29). After endotracheal intubation, the endotracheal tube cuff pressure was set at 22 cmH2O in the neutral position of the head. The cuff pressure was measured again after lateral rotation of the head and readjusted to 22 cmH2O. In addition, the change in distance from the carina to the tip of the endotracheal tube was measured before and after the change in position. The incidences of cough, sore throat, and hoarseness were assessed at 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS There were no differences between groups in terms of patient characteristics and duration of anesthesia. The change in cuff pressure after head rotation in Group S (8.07 ± 1.07 cmH2O) was greater than that in Group O (2.24 ± 0.95 cmH2O) (P < .001). In addition, 21 (72.4%) patients in Group S and no patient in Group O had pressures above 30 cmH2O (P < .001). Furthermore, the tube tip moved away from the carina by 8.55 ± 7.01 mm in Group S and by 2.83 ± 4.72 mm in Group O (P < .001). CONCLUSION Fixation of the TaperGuard endotracheal tube on the side contralateral to head rotation was associated with a smaller intracuff pressure increase and lesser tube displacement compared to fixation of the tube on the ipsilateral side.","Kim, Saeyoung",Medicine,473,19

Media are an important disseminator of health threat information. This study examined potential media effects during the 2009 outbreak of A/H1N1 influenza. HYPOTHESIS To examine the relationship between media reports of the swine flu and self-registrations in an emergency department (ED) of a tertiary hospital in Flanders, Belgium. METHODS All articles concerning swine flu published in seven Flemish newspapers were selected during the biggest flu peak in Belgium. This number was compared with the number of patients who presented themselves with a self-diagnosis of swine flu symptoms during the same time frame. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was selected to determine the relationship. The cross-correlation function determined the direction of this relationship. RESULTS A strong correlation was found between the number of potential patients (n = 308) and the number of articles in the Flemish press (n = 1657). The number of patients was the leading indicator; increases in the volume of written press followed increases in the number of patients. CONCLUSION Media reporting is extensive when a new infectious disease breaks out and intensifies when it is feared that pandemic levels are reached. This was also the case with the swine flu outbreak in Flanders. These findings suggest that a rise in the number of media reports follows a rise in the number of cases, rather than the reverse.","Nelissen, Sara; Beullens, Kathleen; Sabbe, Marc; Van den Bulck, Jan",Prehospital and disaster medicine,473,6

CASE PRESENTATION Here we report a Chinese neonate diagnosed with suspected PA based on the clinical symptoms, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and brain imaging tests. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on the proband. We detected only one heterozygous recurrent nonsense variant (c.937C > T, p.Arg313Ter) in the PCCA gene. When we manually checked the binary alignment map (BAM) diagram of PCCA gene, we found a heterozygous deletion chr13:100915039-100915132delinsAA (c.773_819 + 47delinsAA) (GRCh37.p13) inside the exon 10 in the PCCA gene. The results were validated by Sanger sequencing and qPCR method in the family: the variant (c.937C > T, p.Arg313Ter) was in the maternal allele, and the delins was in the paternal allele. When the mother was pregnant again, prenatal diagnosis was carried out through amniocentesis at 18 weeks gestation, the fetus carried neither of the two mutations. After birth, newborn screening was undertaken, the result was negative. CONCLUSIONS We identified a recurrent c.937C > T and a novel c.773_819 + 47delinsAA mutations in the PCCA gene, which may be the genetic cause of the phenotype of this patient. Our findings expanded the spectrum of causative genotype-phenotype of the PCCA gene. For the cases, the NGS results revealed only a heterozygous mutation in autosomal recessive disease when the gene is associated with phenotypes, it is necessary to manually check the BAM diagram to improve the detection rate. Targeted NGS is an effective technique to detect the various genetic lesions responsible for the PA in one step. Genetic testing is essential for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis in the family to avoid birth defects.","Wang, Hai-Rong; Liu, Yan-Qiu; He, Xue-Lian; Sun, Jun; Zeng, Fan-Wei; Yan, Cheng-Bin; Li, Hao; Gao, Shu-Yang; Yang, Yun",BMC medical genetics,473,5

Moreover, the value of self-reported weight changes, a more practical approach to assess long-term history in adiposity status, is still a matter of debate. In this longitudinal study, long-term changes in BMI and overweight status were assessed in 106 healthy young adults (age 40.5 ± 1.1 years, 60 males). These were a subgroup of adolescent school students who had originally been examined in 1983 initially aiming to assess cardiovascular risk factor prevalence. Markers of early (carotid IMT) and advanced (presence of plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries and ankle-brachial index, ABI) subclinical atherosclerosis were measured in all individuals. By multivariate analysis, among other risk factors, IMT and the presence of plaques were independently determined by BMI change, while a low ABI was also determined by changes in overweight status. An adverse long term adiposity profile change (≥ +4 kg/m(2) and/or change into overweight/obese status from normal weight since adolescence) incrementally determined a low ABI over current risk factors. Self-reported and actual BMI changes were correlated (r = 0.587) but their means significantly differed, while the former significantly correlated with IMT only (P = 0.032). In conclusion, an adverse long term adiposity status change was more prominently associated with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and particularly low ABI. These results also suggest that the utility of self-reported weight changes may be limited in primary prevention practice.","Terzis, Ioannis D; Papamichail, Christos; Psaltopoulou, Theodora; Georgiopoulos, George A; Lipsou, Niki; Chatzidou, Sofia; Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios; Kollias, Georgios; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Zakopoulos, Nikolaos; Alevizaki, Maria; Stamatelopoulos, Kimon S",Obesity,473,29

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 15) with naturally occurring chylothorax that underwent TD ligation. METHODS Medical records of dogs treated with thoracoscopic TD ligation in which NIRFL was utilized for intraoperative TD identification were reviewed. Data retrieved included CT lymphography (CTL) and surgical data, fluorophore dose and injection site, and timing and quality of operative TD identification. RESULTS Preoperative CTL was successful in 13/15 dogs and operative NIRFL was successful in 15/15 dogs. Popliteal lymph node injection achieved successful NIRFL within ≤10 minutes in 7/11 in which it was attempted. TDs identified by NIRFL imaging correlated with TDs identified by preoperative CTL in 12/13 cases in which CTL was achieved. In 1/13 cases, NIRFL identified small lymphatics not visible on CTL. In 5/9 cases in which methylene blue (MB) and ICG were combined for operative lymphography, no ducts or fewer ducts were recorded as identifiable by visible MB than by NIRFL or CTL. The median dose of ICG to achieve NIRFL imaging was 0.05 mg/kg. Thoracoscopic TD ligation was successfully achieved in all patients. CONCLUSION NIRFL is a viable technique to aid in TD identification during thoracoscopy. High contrast NIRF illumination of the TD can be achieved with successful intraparenchymal injection of ICG into the popliteal lymph node.","Steffey, Michele A; Mayhew, Philipp D",Veterinary surgery : VS,473,19

Consideration should be given to the use of dual antibiotic preoperative treatment with cephazolin and metronidazole for all hysterectomies. SUMMARY Despite advancements, SSI in gynecologic surgery remains a major cause of perioperative morbidity and healthcare cost. Modifiable risk factors should be evaluated and patients optimized to the best extent possible prior to surgery. Preoperative risks include obesity, hyperglycemia, smoking, and untreated preexisting infections. Intraoperative risk-reducing strategies include appropriate perioperative antibiotics, correct topical preparation, maintaining normothermia, and minimizing blood loss.

METHODS We compared data from RCTs with unselected standard care data. First, we systematically reviewed RCTs that investigated the effect of supervised exercise therapy in patients with intermittent claudication. For each of the RCTs, we extracted and categorized the eligibility criteria and their justifications. To assess whether people in RCTs (n = 1,440) differed from patients treated in daily practice (n = 3,513), in terms of demographics, comorbidity and walking capacity, we assessed between group-differences using t-tests. To assess differences in treatment response, we compared walking distances at three and six months between groups using t-tests. Differences of ≥15% were set as a marker for a clinically relevant difference. RESULTS All 20 included RCTs excluded large segments of patients with intermittent claudication. One-third of the RCTs eligibility criteria were justified. Despite, the numerous eligibility criteria, we found that baseline characteristics were largely comparable. A statistically significant and (borderline) clinically relevant difference in treatment response after three and six months between trial participants and standard care patients was found. Improvements in maximum walking distance after three and six months were significantly and clinically less in trial participants. CONCLUSIONS The finding that baseline characteristics of patients included in RCTs and patients treated in standard care were comparable, may indicate that RCT eligibility criteria are used implicitly by professionals when referring patients to standard physiotherapy care. The larger treatment response reported in standard physiotherapy care compared to clinical trials, might suggest that scientific studies underestimate the benefits of supervised exercise therapy in patients with intermittent claudication.","Dörenkamp, S; Mesters, E P E; Nijhuis-van der Sanden, M W G; Teijink, J A W; de Bie, R A; Hoogeboom, T J",PloS one,473,4

Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are widely distributed in primates and their distribution in bats is unknown. In this study, a total of 370 faecal swab samples from 19 bat species were collected from various provinces of China and examined for the presence of AAVs. The mean prevalence rate was 22.4% (83 positives out of 370 samples), ranging from 10 to 38.9% among different bat species. The genome sequence spanning the entire rep-cap ORFs was determined from one chosen AAV-positive sample (designated BtAAV-YNM). Phylogenetic analysis of the entire rep-cap ORF coding sequences suggested that BtAAV-YNM is relatively distant to known primate AAVs, but phylogenetically closer to porcine AAV strain Po3. Further analysis of the partial cap ORF sequences of bat AAV samples (n=49) revealed a remarkably large genetic diversity, with an average pairwise nucleotide identity of only 84.3%. Co-presence of multiple distinctive genotypes of bat AAV within an individual sample was also observed. These results demonstrated that diverse AAVs might be widely distributed in bat populations.","Li, Yan; Ge, Xingyi; Hon, Chung-Chau; Zhang, Huajun; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Yunzhi; Wu, Yi; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zhengli",The Journal of general virology,473,1

A recent meta-analysis comparing the use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings found a statistically significant reduction in surgical-site infection. The use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is gaining acceptance in this population; however, the economic impact of this innovative dressing remains unknown. In this study, a cost-utility analysis was performed assessing closed-incision negative-pressure therapy and standard dressings following closure of abdominal incisions in high-risk patients. METHODS Cost-utility methodology involved reviewing literature related to closed-incision negative-pressure therapy in abdominal wall surgery, obtaining utility estimates to calculate quality-adjusted life-year scores for successful surgery and surgery complicated by surgical-site infection, summing costs using Medicare Current Procedural Terminology codes, and creating a decision tree illuminating the most cost-effective dressing strategy. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS The aforementioned meta-analysis comparing closed-incision negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings included a subset of five studies assessing abdominal wall surgery in 829 patients (260 closed-incision negative-pressure therapy and 569 standard dressings). Decision tree analysis revealed an estimated savings of $1546.52 and a gain of 0.0024 quality-adjusted life-year with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy compared with standard dressings; therefore, closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is a dominant treatment strategy. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is a cost-effective option when the surgical-site infection rate is greater than 16.39 percent. CONCLUSION The use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is cost-saving following closure of abdominal incisions in high-risk patients.","Chopra, Karan; Gowda, Arvind U; Morrow, Chris; Holton, Luther; Singh, Devinder P",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,473,17

The impact of the cervical carotid lesion cause (ie, atherosclerotic versus dissection) on outcome of tandem patients endovascularly treated remains to be assessed. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed individual data of prospectively collected consecutive tandem patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy. The primary outcome was favorable outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). Secondary efficacy outcomes included successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction scores of 2b-3), time to reperfusion, and safety outcomes encompassed procedural complications, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Among the 295 included patients, 65 had cervical carotid dissection and 230 had cervical carotid atherosclerotic cause. The rate of favorable outcome was 56.3% in the dissection group versus 47.6% in the atherosclerotic arm (center-, age-, and admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-2.30; P=0.85). No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes. The rates of successful reperfusion, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality were 78.5% versus 74.5% (P=0.13), 4.6% versus 5.2% (P=1.0), and 7.8% versus 15.3% (P=0.94) in the dissection versus atherosclerotic groups, respectively. The median procedural time was 76 minutes (interquartile range, 52-95 minutes) in the dissection group and 67 minutes (interquartile range, 45-98 minutes) in the atherosclerotic group (P=0.24). CONCLUSIONS We found no differences in the outcomes of patients with anterior circulation tandem atherosclerotic and dissection lesions treated with endovascular thrombectomy.

Lived Experiences of People Diagnosed With COVID-19 Infection in Denmark.,18.417809,4.9690866,2021-02-08,"A corollary discharge (CD) is a copy of a neuronal command for movement sent to other brain regions to inform them of the impending movement. In monkeys, a circuit from superior colliculus (SC) through medial dorsal thalamus (MD) to frontal eye field (FEF) carries such a CD for saccadic eye movements. This circuit provides the clearest example of such internal monitoring reaching cerebral cortex. In this report we first investigated the functional organization of the critical MD relay by systematically recording neurons within a grid of penetrations. In two male rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we found that lateral MD neurons carrying CD signals discharged before saccades to ipsilateral as well as contralateral visual fields instead of just contralateral fields, often had activity over large movement fields, and had activity from both central and peripheral visual fields. Each of these characteristics has been found in FEF, but these findings indicate that these characteristics are already present in the thalamus. These characteristics show that the MD thalamic relay is not passive but instead assembles inputs from the SC before transmission to cortex. We next determined the exact location of the saccade-related CD neurons using the grid of penetrations. The neurons occupy an anterior-posterior band at the lateral edge of MD, and we established this band in stereotaxic coordinates to facilitate future study of CD neurons. These observations reveal both the organizational features of the internal CD signals within the thalamus, and the location of the thalamic relay for those signals.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA corollary discharge (CD) circuit within the brain keeps an internal record of physical movements. In monkeys and humans one such CD keeps track of rapid eye movements, and in monkeys a circuit carrying this CD extends from midbrain to cerebral cortex through a relay in the thalamus. This circuit provides guidance for eye movements, contributes to stable visual perception, and when defective, might be related to difficulties that schizophrenic patients have in recognizing their own movements. This report facilitates the comparison of the circuit in monkeys and humans, particularly for comparison of the location of the thalamic relay in monkeys and in humans.","Cavanaugh, James; McAlonan, Kerry; Wurtz, Robert H",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,473,12

The objective of this study was to determine for the first time whether a short-term supplementation with ubiquinol could have a modulating effect on bone turnover and energy metabolism associated with strenuous exercise. The participants (n = 100 healthy and well-trained firemen) were randomly divided into two groups: ubiquinol group (ubiquinol (200 mg day-1)) and control group (placebo) for two weeks. The protocol consisted of conducting two identical strenuous exercise tests with a rest period between tests of 24 h. Blood samples were collected before supplementation (basal value) (T1), after supplementation (T2), after the first physical exercise test (T3), after 24 h of rest (T4), and after the second physical exercise test (T5). Parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin (OC), osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), sclerotin (SOST), alkaline phosphatase (AP), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), insulin, leptin, adrenaline, noradrenaline and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) were determined. Our protocol increased ACTH, SOST, PTH and OC levels, while it decreased OPN. This protocol also increased adrenaline, noradrenaline and PCG-1α, and decreased insulin. After ubiquinol supplementation, PTH, OC, OPG, alkaline phosphatase, leptin, insulin, noradrenaline and PGC-1α levels increased in the supplemented group compared to the control group after the exercise protocol. Strenuous exercise has a clear effect on energy metabolism and bone turnover. These effects are modulated by ubiquinol supplementation, which especially increases the biomarkers of bone formation during strenuous exercise. In addition, ubiquinol has a beneficial effect on the mobilization of energy sources, fact that it could represent an ergogenic and physiological advantage for skeletal muscles.","Diaz-Castro, Javier; Mira-Rufino, Pablo Javier; Moreno-Fernandez, Jorge; Chirosa, Ignacio; Chirosa, Javier Luis; Guisado, Rafael; Ochoa, Julio J",Food & function,473,31

To ensure safe and effective use of upper-room UVGI, it is necessary to devise a simulation technique that enables engineers, designers, and users to explore the impact of different design and operational parameters. We have developed a simulation technique for calculating UV-C fluence rate within the volume of the upper zone and planar irradiance in the lower occupied zone. Our method is based on established ray-tracing light simulation methods adapted to the UV-C wavelength range. We have included a case study of a typical hospital patient room. In it, we explored the impact of several design parameters: ceiling height, device location, room configuration, proportions, and surface materials. We present a spatially mapped parametric study of the UV-C irradiance distribution in three dimensions. We found that the ceiling height and mounting height of the UVGI fixtures combined can cause the largest variation (up to 22%) in upper zone fluence rate. One of the most important findings of this study is that it is crucial to consider interreflections in the room. This is because surface reflectance is the design parameter with the largest impact on the occupant exposure in the lower zone: Applying materials with high reflectance ratio in the upper portion of the room has the highest negative impact (over 700% variation) on increasing hot spots that may receive over 6 mJ/cm2 UV dose in the lower occupied zone.","Hou, Miaomiao; Pantelic, Jovan; Aviv, Dorit",Indoor air,473,27

However, the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMIs for health promotion interventions has not been evaluated systematically. Therefore, the aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMIs regarding health promotion. Additionally, the cultural adaptation features of these interventions will be outlined. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMIs to promote health behaviours in the field of healthy eating, smoking cessation, alcohol consumption, physical activity and sexual health behaviour will be identified via a systematic search of the databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL.

METHODOLOGY Forty-one patients were enrolled in this study from two COVID-19 designated hospitals in Wuhan. Patients underwent chest CT scans for screening and were divided into two groups based on pneumonia-related syndromes. The clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were reviewed and compared. RESULTS Among the sample of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester, there was no mortality or severe complications in the mothers nor newborns. Nearly 40% of the patients in the study were asymptomatic. The most common pneumonia-related symptom in symptomatic pregnant patients was cough. Asymptomatic patients had a significantly shorter duration of hospitalisation and a lower rate of positive RT-PCR testing compared with symptomatic patients. There was no statistically significant difference in antibody test results between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients during hospitalisation, while the positive rate of IgM antibody testing was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Clinical manifestation of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were atypical and concealed.

It is classically characterized by a triad of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), hypoparathyroidism (HP), and adrenal insufficiency (ADI). METHODS Literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases using related keywords, and included studies were systematically evaluated. RESULTS The authors reviewed 938 APECED patients and the classic triad of APECED was detected in 57.3% (460 of 803) of patients. CMC (82.5%) was reported as the earliest, HP (84.2%) as the most prevalent, and ADI (72.2%) as the latest presentation within the classic triad. A broad spectrum of non-triad involvements has also been reported; mainly included ectodermal dystrophy (64.5%), infections (58.7%), gastrointestinal disorders (52.0%), gonadal failure (42.0%), neurologic involvements (36.4%), and ocular manifestations (34.3%).

Surgical aspects such as energy dependent tissue response and tissue sealing to reduce bleeding are usually investigated in animal experiments. Extra-corporal organ models can provide the required experimental information without harming animals and thus reduce or even replace in vivo experiments.

In the ox-foot-model the vein remains in its anatomical bed under reproducible experimental conditions, i.e., blood perfusion, blood pressure, and temperature. Innovative endoluminal surgical procedures using laser light and radio frequency for varicosis treatment were tested. Treatment parameters were investigated systematically in a large number of samples. A standardized preclinical testing procedure could be established and optimized on the basis of acute macroscopic and histological findings. Further, optical coherence tomography could be evaluated as a time-saving diagnostic tool. The ox-foot-model is suitable for training surgical techniques relevant for the treatment of varicosis veins.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of Notch signaling in the pathogenesis of AR and its regulation on Foxp3-Treg cells. METHOD The sera of 100 patients with AR and 50 controls were collected to assess the differences in Notch1, Jagged1, and DLL1 (Delta-like 1) expression. Experimental mice were divided into normal control, AR, Notch inhibitor, and dexamethasone groups. Allergic symptoms, total IgE levels, and the proportion of Treg cells in the peripheral blood were detected. Notch1, Jagged1, NICD (Notch intracellular domain, also known as ICN), and Foxp3 expression and Th1/Th2/Th17-related cytokines in the spleen were detected and compared between each group of mice. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the expression of Notch1 and Jagged1 in patients with AR was significantly elevated (p < 0.05). The expression of Notch1 and Jagged1 in patients with severe AR was higher than that observed in the mild to moderate AR patients and positively correlated with the levels of allergen sIgE (p < 0.05). The animal experiments revealed that compared with the normal control group, the expression of Notch1, Jagged1, and NICD in the AR group was increased, Foxp3 expression was decreased, and the proportion of Treg cells was decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with the AR group, allergic symptoms and total serum IgE levels and the expression of Notch1, Jagged1, and NICD were significantly decreased in the Notch inhibited group, whereas the expression of Foxp3 and the proportion of Treg cells were increased significantly (p < 0.05). The Th2-type immune responses were also enhanced and Th1-type immune responses decreased in the AR group, but the Th1/Th2 imbalance was reversed in the Notch inhibited group. CONCLUSION Notch signaling downregulates Foxp3 expression and inhibits the differentiation of Treg cells to promote the development of AR. Blocking Notch signaling may be a potential treatment for AR.","Jiao, Wo-Er; Wei, Jin-Feng; Kong, Yong-Gang; Xu, Yu; Tao, Ze-Zhang; Chen, Shi-Ming",International archives of allergy and immunology,473,1

Reply.,18.517258,4.9843926,2021-02-19,"As of 2016, Medicaid accounted for nearly 20% of state general fund budgets. Optional Medicaid services like podiatry are often subject to cost-cutting measures in periods of economic downturn, as was the case in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis. Although the cuts were intended as a cost-saving measure, research indicates they had the opposite effect. The restriction and limitation of these services during the Great Recession resulted in both poorer health outcomes for beneficiaries, and poorer financial outcomes for state Medicaid programs. With states citing record levels of unemployment as of April 2020 and projecting significant declines in annual revenue in 2021, the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to rival those of the Great Recession. Given the historical precedent for restricting or eliminating optional Medicaid services as a cost-saving measure, it is likely that podiatric services will once again come under scrutiny. Previous efforts by state-level podiatric societies have proven successful in lobbying for the reinstatement of coverage under Medicaid by conveying evidence of the negative outcomes associated with elimination to stakeholders. The specialty must once again engage policymakers by drawing on evidence gleaned and lessons learned from past cuts of optional Medicaid services to avert counterproductive coverage restrictions intended to mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Brewer, Thomas W; Lanese, Bethany G; Appel, Chad L; Cairns, James S; Armstrong, David G",Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association,473,16

If ischemia is the mechanism, can supplemental oxygen reduce pain? The Reducing Tourniquet Associated Pain study investigated whether this simple treatment could extend tourniquet tolerance time to facilitate hand surgery under local or regional anesthesia. METHODS The Reducing Tourniquet Associated Pain study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of healthy volunteers. Participants received either 50% inhaled oxygen or air placebo via a face mask for 3 minutes before and up to 30 minutes after upper arm tourniquet inflation to 250 mmHg. Pain scores were recorded at 2-minute intervals using a validated 100-mm visual analogue scale. The primary outcomes were (1) difference in visual analogue scale score and (2) difference in time taken to reach visual analogue score of 40 mm or more in oxygen and air groups. RESULTS Fifty participants enrolled and, after exclusion criteria were applied, 46 were analyzed (oxygen, n = 23; air, n = 23). Oxygen supplementation was associated with a 29 percent mean reduction in pain on visual analogue scoring compared with air placebo over the entire period of inhalation (p = 0.027). Oxygen also extended the time to visual analogue scale score of 40 mm or more by a mean of 6½ minutes compared with air placebo (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Oxygen is a readily available, low-risk, low-cost treatment that significantly reduced tourniquet-associated pain in this study and significantly increased the time taken to reach visual analogue scale score of 40 or more. The authors recommend oxygen to facilitate hand surgery under a tourniquet and when a regional block fails to control tourniquet pain.","White, Natalia; Dobbs, Thomas D; Murphy, George R F; Khan, Khurram; Batt, Jeremy P; Cogswell, Lucy K",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,473,1

As a way of self-protection, nurses may compartmentalize their own feelings and need assistance and support in processing feelings of bereavement. Nurses spend much of their time caring for patients and their family members, while guiding them through the dying process; however, they may not take adequate time to address their own bereavement needs. OBJECTIVE/AIMS The aims of this study were to explore the bereavement needs of critical care nurses after experiencing the expected or unexpected death of a patient and, from their lived experiences, gain insight as to how nurses perceive, process, and cope with the death of a patient. METHODOLOGY A qualitative, phenomenological focus group was conducted with critical care nurses (N = 10) after gaining institutional review board approval. The group discussion was audio-recorded and transcribed. Content analysis was performed to identify common themes. RESULTS Seven themes emerged: (a) emotional distress, leading to compassion fatigue, burnout, and moral distress, (b) empathy, (c) resurfacing personal loss leading to secondary traumatic stress in the workplace, (d) unrealistic expectations placed on the nurse, (e) detachment leading to compartmentalization, (f) lack of formal education, and (g) self-care and available resources. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION More education for nurses in undergraduate and continuing education programs is needed to assist nurses in the bereavement process. More interventional studies are needed to explore programs of nurses' self-care both in the workplace and in nurses' personal lives to more effectively support their emotional needs.","Omran, Taline; Browning Callis, Annette M",Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN,473,5

BACKGROUND As SARS-CoV-2 spreads and health care facilities near or exceed capacity, facilities may implement alternative care sites (ACSs). With COVID-19 surges predicted, developing additional capacity in alternative facilities, including hotels and convention centers, into patient care environments requires early careful consideration of the existing space constraints, infrastructure, and modifications needed for patient care and infection control. Design-based strategies utilizing engineering solutions have the greatest impact, followed by medical and operational strategies. METHODS This article evaluates infection control and environmental strategies in inpatient units and proposes system modifications to ACS surge facilities to reduce infection risk and improve care environments. RESULTS Although adequate for an acute infectious disease outbreak, existing capacity in U.S. biocontainment units and airborne infection isolation rooms is not sufficient for widespread infection control and isolation during a pandemic. To improve patients' outcomes and decrease infection transmission risk in the alternative care facility, hospital planners, administrators, and clinicians can take cues from evidence-based strategies implemented in biocontainment units and standard inpatient rooms. CONCLUSIONS Innovative technologies, including optimized air-handling systems with ultraviolet and particle filters, can be an essential part of an infection control strategy. For flexible surge capacity in future ACS and hospital projects, interdisciplinary design and management teams should apply strategies optimizing the treatment of both infectious patients and minimizing the risk to health care workers.","Gordon, David; Ward, Jane; Yao, Christopher J; Lee, Joyce",HERD,473,12

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of a covered stent graft in treating cervical carotid artery disease in a consecutive series of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to tandem lesion in a single high-volume Comprehensive Stroke Center. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients that underwent carotid endovascular interventions during mechanical thrombectomy for AIS using a self-expanding covered stent graft at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital between 2016 and 2018 was conducted. Patient clinical and angiographical characteristics as well as postoperative outcome and follow-up were recorded. RESULTS A total of eight patients were treated with the covered stents, and we observed significant improvement in stroke severity at 24 h in 5/8 patients (mean NIHSS 18 ± 5 vs 12 ± 8, p = 0.02). Successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3) after thrombectomy was achieved in 5/8 (62.5%) patients. One stent occluded during the procedure. At 3-month follow-up, stents were patent in three (37.5%) patients (two with mRS 3 and one with mRS 1). The stents of the remaining four patients (62.5%) were occluded (one with mRS 2 and three with mRS 4), although the patients did not show signs of stroke recurrence. CONCLUSION The preliminary results of our study show that the self-expanding covered stent graft did not achieve satisfactory patency at 90-days among patients with AIS and tandem lesions, suggesting that its use in the carotid circulation may not be recommended in the context of AIS.","Piñana, Carlos; Gramegna, Laura Ludovica; Folleco, Edgar; Requena, Manuel; Hernandez, David; Tomasello Weitz, Alejandro",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,473,20

The current report presents information on BoCV infections associated with enteric disease of postweaned beef cattle in Oklahoma. In 3 separate accessions from a single herd, 1 in 2012 and 2 in 2013, calves were observed with bloody diarrhea. One calf in 2012 died and was necropsied, and 2 calves from this herd died in 2013 and were necropsied. A third calf from another herd died and was necropsied. The gross and histologic diagnosis was acute, hemorrhagic colitis in all 4 cattle. Colonic tissues from all 4 animals were positive by fluorescent antibody testing and/or immunohistochemical staining for BoCV antigen. Bovine coronavirus was isolated in human rectal tumor cells from swabs of colon surfaces of all animals. The genomic information from a region of the S envelope region revealed BoCV clade 2. Detection of BoCV clade 2 in beef cattle in Oklahoma is consistent with recovery of BoCV clade 2 from the respiratory tract of postweaned beef calves that had respiratory disease signs or were healthy.

This study explores the synergistic effects of flipped classrooms and a wiki-authoring group activity on students' learning outcomes and the quality and quantity of their group-work. METHODS In this action research, 205 master students of a medical school were involved in a course blended with flipped classrooms. While learning from online and in-class activities, students did their group assignment on an educational wiki (n = 85) or in a conventional way (n = 120). Assessment in this study was done in both formative and summative ways. Formative assessment included quizzes at the beginning of each class and students' self-assessment (focused on their satisfaction with different educational activities of the course, using an 11-item validated satisfaction questionnaire). The summative assessment incorporated assessment of the quantity and quality of students' participation in doing group assignments(by a five-item checklist); quizzes at the end of each class; the final exam; assessment of students' competency in transferring their learning into creating an outline for a hypothetical article and writing topic sentences. Using SPSS 21.0 and employing independent samples t or Mann -Whitney U tests, the educational impacts of the course were compared in two groups. RESULTS Students in the wiki-group were more satisfied with the course. Both quantity and quality of the group assignment among students in the wiki group outweighed those among the students in the non-wiki group. Univariate linear regression analysis of the models between students' satisfaction with flipped classrooms and the quality of their participation in doing their group as well as their attitude towards the group assignment showed that the changes in the quality of the wiki students' group assignment and their attitude were dependent on the changes of their satisfaction with flipped classrooms. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study confirm that a wiki-authoring group assignment is effective in achieving student learning outcomes and integrating a wiki with flipped classrooms increases wiki accomplishment. Collaborating on a wiki activity improves both quality and quantity of group assignments among students.","Khoynaroud, Ali Ahmadian; Akbarzadeh, Amirhossein; Ghojazadeh, Morteza; Ghaffarifar, Saeideh",BMC medical education,473,1

Furthermore, the present study assessed the prognostic value of GINS2 in patients with breast cancer via the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The results of the present study demonstrated that the mRNA levels of GINS2 were significantly higher in breast cancer tissue compared with normal tissue. In addition, high mRNA expression levels of GINS2 were associated with high Scarff-Bloom-Richardson status grades, a basal-like status and age (≤51 years); however, it was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The survival analysis revealed that increased GINS2 mRNA levels were associated with a worse prognosis for relapse-free survival in all patients with breast cancer, particularly in those with estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive subtypes. In addition, a positive association between the GINS2, CENPM and MCM4 genes was confirmed. The results of the present study suggest that GINS2 could be used as a potential prognostic biomarker for breast cancer. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to confirm the effects of GINS2 on the pathogenesis and development of patients with breast cancer.","Yu, Shibo; Zhu, Lizhe; Xie, Peiling; Jiang, Siyuan; Wang, Ke; Liu, Yang; He, Jianjun; Ren, Yu",Oncology letters,473,19

Epigenetic modification has been found to play an important role in cell differentiation and regulation, among which histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in suppressing genes by removing histone acetyl groups. The use of HDAC inhibitor to control this is increasing and has been widely studied by many researchers. This study aimed to induce differentiation by causing epigenetic changes in odontoblast-related genes and the MAPK signaling pathway in human dental pulp stem cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed increased expression of DMP-1, ALP, DSPP, and RUNX2 compared to the control. However, activation of the MAPK signaling system was similar to but slightly different from the expression of odontoblast-related proteins. After 3 days, as shown by MTT and LDH assays, proliferation decreased overall, but cytotoxicity decreased at only a specific concentration. We confirmed that there was no change in mRNA expression of caspase 3 or 9 using real-time PCR. In addition, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that differentiation occurred due to the decrease in the expression of the CD73 and CD146. Although overall proliferation was reduced due to the G2/M inhibition of the cell cycle, the expression of BCL-2 protected the cells from cell death. Overall, cell proliferation decreased in response to MS-275, but it did not induce cytotoxicity in 5 nM and 10 nM concentration and induces differentiation into odontoblast-like cells.","Lee, Eun-Cheol; Kim, Yu-Mi; Lim, Han-Moi; Ki, Ga-Eun; Seo, Young-Kwon",International journal of molecular sciences,473,6

Compression therapy is recommended as the gold standard treatment in clinical practice, although a large number of venous leg ulcers remain unhealed after several years. Physical activity may improve healing although there is limited evidence on the effects of physical activity as an adjuvant treatment to compression to improve venous leg ulcers healing and prevent recurrence. Objectives: This scoping review protocol aims to systematically search, appraise, and synthesize quantitative research evidence to assess the effect of physical activity interventions applied in conjunction with compression therapy on venous leg ulcer healing and recurrence. Methods and Analysis: We will use the methodology framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley, Levac et al., the JBI as a guide. We will also follow the three-step search strategy recommended by the JBI to systematic search for relevant published research, ongoing clinical trials, and grey literature. Two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts followed by full-text review to determine final eligibility for inclusion. The search process will be reported using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow chart. Characteristics of physical activity interventions, primary outcomes related to ulcer healing and recurrence, and secondary outcomes of interest included quality of life, pain level, adverse effects, and economic costs will be extracted and summarized. The review will provide a descriptive account of the findings from included studies. Where appropriate, data will be pooled for a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Discussion: Physical activity interventions represent a low-cost, potentially useful adjuvant treatment to compression therapy for the management of venous leg ulcers. Several gaps in knowledge remain that are answerable via a targeted scoping review. This protocol outlines the rationale, objectives, and the planned methodology for conducting the study. Ethics and Dissemination: The scoping review will use data from publicly available sources and ethical approval is not required.

Here, we investigated the prognostic significance of SaO in patients treated with IVT for suspected ischemic stroke. METHODS In this multicenter, IVT-registry-based study we assessed the association between SaO and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH, ECASS-II definition), 3-month mortality and 3-month functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression, coarsened exact matching and inverse probability weighted analyses. RESULTS Among 10,074 IVT-treated patients, 146 (1.5%) had SaO. SaO patients had significantly higher NIHSS and glucose on admission and more often female sex, prior stroke and prior functional dependence than non-SaO patients. In unadjusted analysis, they had generally less favorable outcomes. After controlling for confounders in adjusted, matched and weighted analyses, all associations between SaO and any of the outcomes disappeared, including sICH (odds ratio [OR]unadjusted 1.53 [95% confidence interval: 0.74,3.14], ORadjusted 0.52[0.13,2.16], ORmatched 0.68[0.15,3.03], ORweighted 0.95[0.39,2.32]), mortality (ORunadjusted 1.49[1.00,2.24], ORadjusted 0.98[0.5,1.92], ORmatched 1.13[0.55,2.33], ORweighted 1.17[0.73,1.88]) and functional outcome (mRS≥3 / ordinal mRS: ORunadjusted 1.33[0.96,1.84] / 1.35[1.01,1.81], ORadjusted 0.78[0.45,1.32] / 0.78[0.52,1.16], ORmatched 0.75[0.43,1.32] / 0.45[0.10,2.06], ORweighted 0.87[0.57,1.34] / 1.00[0.66,1.52]). These results were consistent regardless of whether patients had an eventual diagnosis of ischemic stroke (89/146) or stroke mimic (57/146 SaO patients). INTERPRETATION SaO was not an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Withholding IVT from patients with assumed ischemic stroke presenting with SaO seems unjustified.

Fisher and Robertson (1999) first showed the existence of a silk gland in the head of adult Melissotarsus beccarii workers, and we confirm this with detailed histology and ultrastructural comparisons of both queens and workers. This African genus exhibits extreme morphological adaptations (legs, head shape and mandibular muscles) for tunnelling behaviour inside living trees, that underlie an obligate mutualism with scale insects. Rhopalomastix is its sister genus distributed across Asia, and we show that queens and workers also have a silk gland. This lineage of minute workers relies on silk to secure their network of tunnels against other arboreal ants. We show striking differences between these genera in the anatomy and ultrastructure of the cells that secrete silk, especially numerous vacuoles and an unexpectedly branched end apparatus in Melissotarsus. Moreover, the legs of Melissotarsus are much more specialized for tunnelling, and this includes highly expanded basitarsi. The latter house the novel 'Delage-Darchen gland', and we document its anatomy and ultrastructure, suggesting a proteinaceous secretion to harden roofs made of silk combined with wood fragments. The restriction of the Delage-Darchen gland to Melissotarsus, combined with a modified silk gland (an almost three-fold increase in the number of secretory cells, and ultrastructural differences suggestive of higher secretory activity), are evidence of an outstanding evolutionary divergence relative to Rhopalomastix. Synthesis of silk by adults is a significant innovation among ants, but its augmented production in Melissotarsus makes them better adapted for the hazards of arboreal life.","Billen, Johan; Peeters, Christian",Arthropod structure & development,473,11

However, few analyses are specifically dedicated to quantifying the financial impact of the pandemic on practicing neurosurgeons. The authors present a survey analysis to address this need. METHODS The authors distributed a 19-question survey to practicing neurosurgeons in the United States and its territories. The questions evaluated respondents' assessments of changes in patient and procedural volume, salary and benefits, practice expenses, staffing, applications for government assistance, and stroke management. Responses were stratified by geographic region. RESULTS The response rate was 5.1% (267/5224). Most respondents from each region noted a >50% decrease in clinic volume. Respondents from the Northeast observed a 76% decrease in procedure volume, which was significantly greater than that of other regions (p=0.003). Northeast respondents were also significantly more likely to have been re-assigned to non-neurosurgical clinical duties during the pandemic (p<0.001). Most respondents also noted decreased salary and benefits however experienced no changes in overall practice expenses, and most respondents have not experienced significant reductions in nursing or midlevel staffing. These trends were not significantly different between regions. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has led to decreases in patient and procedural volume and physician compensation despite stable practice expenses. Significantly more respondents in the Northeast region noted decreases in procedural volume and re-assignment to non-neurosurgical COVID-related medical duties. Future analysis is necessary as the pandemic evolves and the long-term clinical and economic implications become clear.","Caruso, James P; Swartz, Karin; Mazzola, Catherine; Ban, Vin Shen; Singh, Ravi; Eldridge, Cody; Schirmer, Clemens; Cheng, Joseph; Bauer, Andrew M; Steinmetz, Michael; Adogwa, Owoicho",World neurosurgery,473,31

The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive capability of LA diameter (LAD) and LA volume (LAV) by echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) to determine success in patients undergoing RFCA of AF. METHODS Eighty-eight patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF who had undergone RFCA and had a prior transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and CT were enrolled in the study. TTE LADs and LV ejection fraction as well as TEE LADs and LAVs in three views were recorded. CT LAVs were also recorded. Clinical parameters prior to ablation as well as at 1-year follow-up were assessed. RESULTS A total of 40 (45%) patients with paroxysmal AF and 48 (55%) patients with persistent AF were analyzed. Paroxysmal AF patients had a RFCA success rate of 88% at 1 year with persistent AF patients having a 52% success rate (P < 0.001). A CT-derived LAV >or= 117 cc was associated with an odds ratio (OR) for recurrence of 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]=[1.4-16.4], P = 0.01) while a LAV >or=130 cc was associated with an OR for recurrence of 22.0 (95% CI =[2.5-191.0], P = 0.005) after adjustment for persistent AF. CONCLUSIONS LA dimensions and AF type are highly predictive of AF recurrence following RFCA. LAV by CT has significant predictive benefit over standard LADs in severely enlarged atria even after adjustment for AF type.","Parikh, Sachin S; Jons, Christian; McNitt, Scott; Daubert, James P; Schwarz, Karl Q; Hall, Burr",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,473,1

Patient-reported anxiety, depression and sleep quality might have changed due to these special circumstances. Therefore, we analyzed the symptom burden of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy at our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed of 50 consecutive patients and the results were compared to those obtained in a previous pre-COVID study. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale was employed to assess the preradiotherapy symptoms. RESULTS The highest mean scores were reported for pain in activity (3.2) and dry mouth (3.1). Regarding anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep, the corresponding scores were 1.5, 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. Compared to the previous study, no significant increases were found. Most items had numerically lower mean values, e.g. anxiety (1.5 vs. 2.7). Both study populations had comparable median age (70.5 vs. 70 years), gender distribution and proportion of patients with bone metastases. However, there were two significant imbalances, namely a lower proportion of patients with prostate cancer (12 vs. 30%, p=0.02) and breast cancer (0 vs. 12%, p=0.02). CONCLUSION In patients who showed up for radiation treatment planning, the suspected increase in anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep disturbance was not demonstrable. It is not known whether or not patients with substantial worries chose to decline referral to palliative radiotherapy. Therefore, comprehensive large-scale studies of patterns of care are needed to fully understand the impact of COVID-19-related measures.","Nieder, Carsten; Johnsen, Silje K; Winther, Annette M",Anticancer research,473,31

This study has been designed to evaluate the risk factors for prolonged operative time in SILC. METHODS From April 2010 to August 2014, 323 cases of 3-channel SILC (Konyang standard method [KSM] group) and 399 cases of 4-channel SILC (modified KSM [mKSM] group) using a snake retractor were performed. RESULTS The clinical characteristics were not significantly different between KSM and mKSM group except preoperative percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) treatment (9.6% vs. 16.5%, P < 0.007). The mean operation time was longer in mKSM group than KSM group (55.8 ± 19.7 minutes vs. 51.7 ± 20.1 minutes, P = 0.006). The estimated blood loss of KSM group was more than mKSM group (24.6 ± 54.1 mL vs. 16.9 ± 27.0 mL, P = 0.013). According to the histopathologic findings, acute cholecystitis or empyema were confirmed more in mKSM group as compared with KSM group (28% vs. 14.0%, P = 0.025). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for prolonged operation time were drainage insertion, histopathologic findings (acute cholecystitis or empyema), surgeons' technical expertise, body mass index > 30 kg/m(2) as well as the 4-channel SILC. CONCLUSION Among patients with these risk factors, conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be considered as well although SILC might be safe and feasible modality for benign gallbladder disease.","Cheon, Seong Uk; Moon, Ju Ik; Choi, In Seok",Annals of surgical treatment and research,473,1

Inadequate support outside of the hospital is a limiting factor in home location feasibility, particularly in rural regions lacking pediatric-trained hospice providers. METHODS The purpose of this longitudinal palliative telehealth support pilot study was to explore physical and emotional symptom burden and family impact assessments for children with terminal cancer receiving home based-hospice care. Each child received standard of care home-based hospice care from an adult-trained rural hospice team with the inclusion of telehealth pediatric palliative care visits at a scheduled minimum of every 14 days. RESULTS Eleven children (mean age 11.9 years) received pediatric palliative telehealth visits a minimum of every 14 days, with an average of 4.8 additional telehealth visits initiated by the family. Average time from enrollment to death was 21.6 days (range 4-95). Children self-reported higher physical symptom prevalence than parents or hospice nurses perceived the child was experiencing at time of hospice enrollment with underrecognition of the child's emotional burden. At the time of hospice enrollment, family impact was reported by family caregivers as 46.4/100 (SD 18.7), with noted trend of improved family function while receiving home hospice care with telehealth support. All children remained at home for end-of-life care.

The generation of hybrid peptides by combining the genes that encode two different bacteriocins has made it possible to study the mechanisms of action of the bacteriocins that compose them and also develop new peptides with improved biotechnological applications. Hybrid bacteriocins may be obtained in several ways. In our laboratory, by combining enterocin CRL35 and microcin V (Ent35-MccV), we obtained a broad-spectrum peptide that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ent35-MccV is sensitive to the action of intestinal proteases and is heat resistant, which makes it a good candidate for use as a biopreservative. For this reason, the peptide was tested in skim milk and beef burgers as food models. We also obtained more potent variants of the hybrid by modifying the central amino acid of the hinge region that connects the two bacteriocins. This review also discusses future applications and perspectives regarding the Ent35-MccV and other hybrid peptides.Key Points• Ent35-MccV is a new broad-spectrum bacteriocin.• The mechanism of action of bacteriocins can be studied using hybrid peptides.• Genetic engineering allows obtaining improved bacteriocin derivatives.• Hybrid peptides can be used in the food, pharmaceutical, and veterinary applications.","Navarro, S A; Lanza, L; Acuña, L; Bellomio, A; Chalón, Miriam C",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,473,1

This is greatly important to coordinate research and knowledge during a time of uncertainty and protentional fake news. During the 2020 global pandemic, social media has become an ally but also a potential threat. High volumes of information compressed into a short period can result in overwhelmed HCPs trying to discern fact from noise. A major limitation of social media currently is the ability to quickly disseminate false information which can confuse and distract. Society relies on educated scientists and physicians to be leaders in delivering fact-based information to the public. For this reason, in times of crises it is important to be leaders in the conversation of social media to guide correct and helpful information and knowledge to the masses looking for answers.","Venegas-Vera, A Verner; Colbert, Gates B; Lerma, Edgar V",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,473,31

Approaches to design promising drug molecules have gone through many stages, from experiment-based trail-and-error approaches, to the well-established avenue of the quantitative structure-activity relationship, and currently to the stage guided by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence techniques. In this work, we present a study of the permeability of small drug-like molecules across lipid membranes by two types of ML models, namely the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Molecular descriptors and fingerprints are used for featurization of organic molecules. Using molecular descriptors, the LASSO model uncovers that the electro-topological, electrostatic, polarizability, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties are the most important physical properties to determine the membrane permeability of small drug-like molecules. Additionally, with molecular fingerprints, the LASSO model suggests that certain chemical substructures can significantly affect the permeability of organic molecules, which closely connects to the identified main physical properties. Moreover, the DNN model using molecular fingerprints can help develop a more accurate mapping between molecular structures and their membrane permeability than LASSO models. Our results provide deep understanding of drug-membrane interactions and useful guidance for the inverse molecular design of drug-like molecules. Last but not least, while the current focus is on the permeability of drug-like molecules, the methodology of this work is general and can be applied for other complex physical chemistry problems to gain molecular insights.","Chen, Guang; Shen, Zhiqiang; Li, Ying",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,473,16

In this article, the authors review the role of fear in global health by focusing on the leading global cause of death and disability: noncommunicable diseases. Taking an historical perspective, first the authors review Samuel Adams' 1911 analysis of the role of fear in generating public health priority and his recommendations about mass educating the public. Next, they show that Adams' analysis still applies today, drawing on contemporary responses to H1N1 and HIV, while illustrating the ongoing neglect of long-term threats such as noncommunicable diseases. Then, they pose the question, ""Is it possible, necessary, or useful to create a fear factor for noncommunicable diseases?"" After reviewing mixed evidence about the effects of fear on social change (on individual behaviors and on building a mass movement to achieve collective action), the authors conclude by setting out an evidence-based, marketing strategy to generate a sustained, rational response to the noncommunicable disease epidemic.","Alleyne, George; Basu, Sanjay; Stuckler, David",Journal of health communication,473,30

This procedure requires advanced techniques for anorectal surgery. However, it is indicated only for early lesions and should be as minimally invasive as possible. We describe a minimally invasive ISR with a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port. Our case involves a 59-year-old man with hemorrhage from the rectum. Pathologic examination of the transanally resected specimen revealed that the tumor had invaded into the deeper submucosa. To minimize surgical incisions, a SILS port was utilized in place of a 10- and a 5-mm trocar. The SILS port was inserted through a 2.5 cm transverse incision in the right lower abdomen, where a diverting stoma would be created. Two flexible or straight forceps introduced through this port afforded an easier dissection of the rectum to the levator ani muscle, and transanal dissection of the internal sphincter was performed in the standard manner to connect with the abdominal dissection. The only postoperative incision other than a stoma and surgical drain was one 10-mm incision above the umbilicus. Our technique of ISR with the SILS port is a useful clinical application of minimally invasive surgery.","Hara, Masayasu; Sato, Mikinori; Takayama, Satoru; Imafuji, Hiroyuki; Ogawa, Ryo; Takeyama, Hiromitsu","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",473,1

Their action is essential in living organisms facilitating electric signaling, muscle contraction or osmotic stress response among other effects. The protein and the lipid charges configure a polarized interface that yields local ionic concentrations and electric potentials that are very different from those of the bulk electrolyte. The combined effect of gradients of ionic concentration and electric potential causes the transport of ions through channels. Here we analyze charge regulation effects in different protein-lipid conformations, stressing how important is the role of electrostatic interactions in the ion channel function that traditionally has been rationalized paying attention mainly to changes in pore size. Tuning lipid charge combined with conductance and selectivity measurements is shown to be a complementary method to evidence lipid involvement in the structure of a biological ion channel.","Aguilella, Vicente M; Verdiá-Báguena, Carmina; Alcaraz, Antonio",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,473,6

Samples are centrifuged and supernatants passed through an Acrodisc Filter (GXF/GHP 0.2 um, 25 mm diameter). After addition of ammonium acetate, samples are analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS using an AB Sciex 6500 plus Q-Trap mass spectrometer operated in negative multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode. The instrument system incorporates a delay column between the pumps and autosampler to mitigate interference from background PFAS. The method monitors eight short-/long-chain PFAS which are identified by monitoring specific precursor product ion pairs and by their retention times and quantified using isotope mass-labeled internal standard based calibration plots. Average spiked recoveries (n = 8) of target analytes ranged from 84 to 110% with 4-9% relative standard deviation (RSD). The mean spiked recoveries (n = 8) of four surrogates were 94-106% with 3-8% RSD.

These advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) hold one of the keys to making a reality of genuinely personalised medicine. There are an estimated 450 companies across the globe working on the development of gene therapies and more than 1,000 clinical trials underway worldwide, and some 20-30 new ATMPs filings are expected in Europe annually over the next 5 years. But challenges confront the sector, complicating the translation from research into patient access. Scientific, clinical development and regulatory issues are compounded by limited experience with clinical and commercial use, limited manufacturing know-how, high costs, and difficulties in accessing development funding and investment. Pricing and reimbursement and market access issues are an additional challenge, particularly in Europe, where unfamiliarity with the technology and uncertainty over the use of real-world evidence induce caution among clinicians, health technology assessment bodies and payers. There is a need for a review of the suitability of the regulatory and market access framework for these products, focused development of data, public/private partnerships, and fuller collaboration governments, doctors, insurers, patients, and pharmaceutical companies.

Mirtrons are atypical RNA interference effectors that are spliced from transcripts as short introns. Here, we develop a novel mirtron-based knockdown/replacement gene therapy for the mutation-independent treatment of RHO-related ADRP, and demonstrate efficacy in a relevant mammalian model. Splicing and potency of rhodopsin-targeting candidate mirtrons are initially determined, and a mirtron-resistant codon-modified version of the rhodopsin coding sequence is validated in vitro. These elements are then combined within a single adeno-associated virus (AAV) and delivered subretinally in a RhoP23H knock-in mouse model of ADRP. This results in significant mouse-to-human rhodopsin RNA replacement and is associated with a slowing of retinal degeneration. This provides proof of principle that synthetic mirtrons delivered by AAV are capable of reducing disease severity in vivo.","Orlans, Harry O; McClements, Michelle E; Barnard, Alun R; Martinez-Fernandez de la Camara, Cristina; MacLaren, Robert E",Nature communications,473,31

Objective: To examine the pathogenicity of autoantibodies targeting the astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 [aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG)] in the optic nerve. Materials and Methods: Purified IgG from an AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD-ON patient was together with human complement (C) given to wild-type (WT) and type I interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice (IFNAR1-KO) as two consecutive intrathecal injections into cerebrospinal fluid via cisterna magna. The optic nerves were isolated, embedded in paraffin, cut for histological examination, and scored semi-quantitatively in a blinded fashion. In addition, optic nerves were processed to determine selected gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Intrathecal injection of AQP4-IgG+C induced astrocyte pathology in the optic nerve with loss of staining for AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), deposition of C, and demyelination, as well as upregulation of gene expression for interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF7) and CXCL10.

Plasmid curing was performed with novobiocin, acriflavine and elevated incubation temperature to identify plasmids encoded with carbohydrate fermentation and antibiotic resistance genes and to compare them with artificial gastric juice. Plasmid profiling of the strains revealed that 100% of the strains were harbouring plasmids in varying sizes and numbers. The plasmid number of the potential probiotic strains ranged between 1 and 4, and the plasmid size ranged between 5.779 and 16.138 kb. The potential probiotic strains could not survive in the artificial gastric juice at pH 2.0. Although the strains maintained their viability in an artificial gastric juice at pH 2.5 and 3.0, and their derivatives lost their plasmids at a high rate (100%). Similarly, high levels of cured derivatives were obtained with 8 µg/mL novobiocin and 100 µg/mL acriflavine applications, and 24 h incubation at 43 °C. All the experiments were also performed to compare with two L. plantarum-type strains containing plasmids responsible for tetracycline and tetracycline + erythromycin resistances. Artificial gastric juice and other plasmid curing treatments caused a high-frequency loss in the antibiotic resistances of type strains. Determining plasmid stability in artificial gastric juice is a novel approach.

To determine whether cathepsins contribute to reovirus tropism, spread, and disease outcome, we infected 3-day-old wild-type (wt), Ctsb(-/-), Ctsl(-/-), and Ctss(-/-) mice with the virulent reovirus strain T3SA+. The survival rate of Ctsb(-/-) mice was enhanced in comparison to that of wt mice, whereas the survival rates of Ctsl(-/-) and Ctss(-/-) mice were diminished. Peak titers at sites of secondary replication in all strains of cathepsin-deficient mice were lower than those in wt mice. Clearance of the virus was delayed in Ctsl(-/-) and Ctss(-/-) mice in comparison to the levels for wt and Ctsb(-/-) mice, consistent with a defect in cell-mediated immunity in mice lacking cathepsin L or S. Cathepsin expression was dispensable for establishment of viremia, but cathepsin L was required for maximal reovirus growth in the brain. Treatment of wt mice with an inhibitor of cathepsin L led to amelioration of reovirus infection. Collectively, these data indicate that cathepsins B, L, and S influence reovirus pathogenesis and suggest that pharmacologic modulation of cathepsin activity diminishes reovirus disease severity.","Johnson, Elizabeth M; Doyle, Joshua D; Wetzel, J Denise; McClung, R Paul; Katunuma, Nobuhiko; Chappell, James D; Washington, M Kay; Dermody, Terence S",Journal of virology,473,1

For accelerated response evaluation, early tumor shrinkage (ETS) of ≥ 20% has been suggested as a predictor for outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Together with depth of response (DpR), new alternative metrics have been provided, yielding promising outcome parameters. In this analysis, we aimed to further characterize ETS and DpR. PATIENTS AND METHODS This analysis was based on FIRE-3, a randomized phase 3 trial comparing first-line FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab in KRAS exon 2 wild-type mCRC. ETS and DpR were determined on the basis of RECIST 1.1 in a blinded radiologic review. ETS was evaluated as a categorized (≥ 20% shrinkage) and continuous parameter. The impact of baseline location and size of metastases on ETS and DpR were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Of 592 patients, 395 (66.7%) had data available for radiologic review. Median continuous ETS for lung, liver, and suspected lymph node metastases was 20%, 23%, and 30%, respectively. The median DpR was -32%, -44%, and -50%, respectively (all P < .01). In multivariate analysis, lung metastases were significantly associated with inferior DpR (P = .021), whereas hepatic metastases led to higher DpR (P = .024). Large metastases were associated with favorable ETS, whereas small metastases were correlated with higher DpR (P < .001). CONCLUSION ETS and DpR depend on the location and size of metastases in mCRC. These associations may establish the basis for further research to optimize the predictive accuracy of both parameters. This may help basing treatment decisions on ETS and DpR.","Froelich, Matthias F; Petersen, Elina L; Heinemann, Volker; Nörenberg, Dominik; Hesse, Nina; Gesenhues, Alena B; Modest, Dominik P; Sommer, Wieland H; Hofmann, Felix O; Stintzing, Sebastian; Holch, Julian W",Clinical colorectal cancer,473,6

The effects of meteorological parameters on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are a matter of curiosity. The main purpose of this paper is to determine the association between air quality indexes (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) and weather parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure, dew, and wind speed) with the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalizations, hospital discharges. In this paper, we also focused on determining the impact of air pollution and weather parameters on the number of daily hospitalizations and daily discharges. It is gleaned daily cases, hospitalizations, hospital discharges, meteorological, and air quality data in Istanbul from Turkey between July 15, 2020, and September 30, 2020. We performed the Pearson correlation analysis to evaluate the effects of meteorological parameters and air quality indexes on the variables related to SARS-CoV-2. It is determined a statistically significant positive relationship between air quality indexes such as CO, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and the number of daily confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We also observed a negative association between weather parameters such as temperature and pressure and the number of daily confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. Our study proposes that high air quality could reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. The empirical findings of this paper might provide key input to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across Turkey. © 2021 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

Despite the prevalence and negative health and academic consequences associated with food insecurity in college students, barriers exist in food access resource utilization, especially in the wake of COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of food insecurity at Mississippi State University and explore college students' perceptions of food access resources and resource utilization. This study employed a mixed methods design. Quantitative data was gathered from an online survey to assess the prevalence, demographics, and food insecurity status from undergraduate students at Mississippi State University. The 1157 survey respondents then provided the recruitment pool for qualitative data collection, which was obtained via focus groups and open-ended questionnaires to explore student perspectives of food insecurity and food access resources. SPSS 27 was used to determine food security status based on the USDA's Household Food Security Survey Module 6-item short form. NVivo 12 was used for coding and thematic analyses to examine college student perspectives of food insecurity and food access resources. The prevalence of food insecurity among college students was 34.1%. Key influencers emerged as the major theme associated with students' views about food insecurity, and the resources available to address the issue. These influencers were personal beliefs, life skills, and the university. Student perceptions of what it means to need food access resources and the value of a resource were interconnected. Food insecurity continues to occur at a higher prevalence in college student populations than in U.S. households. When addressing food insecurity in this group, key influencers of food insecurity status should be considered when exploring viable intervention strategies that produce acceptable resources that students will use.

Only a few studies have examined the attitudes and conflicts faced by physician fathers, the majority of current practitioners. This work is a subset analysis of responses to qualitative questions on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of emergency physician (EP) fathers. Methods: A convenience sample of physician fathers was obtained from May 2 to June 16, 2020, via social media and email. The survey contained questions on personal and professional struggles during the start of the pandemic and including several free test questions. Free responses were analyzed and coded. Several themes emerged related to experiences described: (1) self;(2) social;(3) home life;(4) work life;(5) financial;(6) immediate family. Under each main theme were subthemes that provided a more detailed match for each comment. Results: There were 260 surveys completed by EP fathers from 31 states. 84% were White, 9% Asian, 1% Black, 5% other. 78% were between 30-49 years;98% reported having a partner. Most fathers had younger children (infants through middle-school aged) living in the household with them at the time of the survey. The three most common themes were “work life” (38%), “immediate family” (20%), and “social” (15%). In “work life” the most common subthemes were “general change in responsibilities” (29%), “decrease in workload/unemployed” (21%), and “concerns/negative feelings towards work” (18%). In “immediate family” both “positive change in family life” (45%) and “negative change in family life” (19%) predominated. Under “social,” “missing/lacking social interaction” (49%) and “missed/cancelled events” (33%) were most common. Of note in other themes in “self,” the two most common subthemes were “negative mental state” (45%) and “decreased productivity” (12%). In “home life,” “change in usual routine/structure/schedule” was the most common (42%) followed by “difficulty caring/assisting children” (28%). The “financial” theme was dominated by the subtheme “financial issues/loss” (94%). Conclusions: This study examined reported concerns and attitudes of EP fathers during the COVID-19 pandemic. EP fathers reported a variety challenges affecting both their personal and professional lives with positive and negative changes.

We used a matching procedure designed to create groups of counties that are aligned along age, race, income, population, and urban/rural categories---socio-demographic variables that have been shown to be correlated with COVID-19 outcomes. We find that counties with IHEs that remained primarily online experienced fewer cases and deaths during the Fall 2020 semester; whereas before and after the semester, these two groups had almost identical COVID-19 incidence. Additionally, we see fewer deaths in counties with IHEs that reported conducting any on-campus testing compared to those that reported none. We complement the statistical analysis with a case study of IHEs in Massachusetts---a rich data state in our dataset---which further highlights the importance of IHE-affiliated testing for the broader community.

Following the initial surges of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and the Beta (B.1.351) variants, a more infectious Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is now surging, further deepening the health crises caused by the pandemic. The sharp rise in cases attributed to the Delta variant has made it especially disturbing and is a variant of concern. Fortunately, current vaccines offer protection against known variants of concern, including the Delta variant. However, the Delta variant has exhibited some ability to dodge the immune system as it is found that neutralizing antibodies from prior infections or vaccines are less receptive to binding with the Delta spike protein. Here, we investigated the structural changes caused by the mutations in the Delta variant’s receptor-binding interface and explored the effects on binding with the ACE2 receptor as well as with neutralizing antibodies. We find that the receptor-binding β-loop-β motif adopts an altered but stable conformation causing separation in some of the antibody binding epitopes. Our study shows reduced binding of neutralizing antibodies and provides a possible mechanism for the immune evasion exhibited by the Delta variant.","Baral, Prabin; Bhattarai, Nisha; Hossen, Md Lokman; Stebliankin, Vitalii; Gerstman, Bernard S.; Narasimhan, Giri; Chapagain, Prem P.",bioRxiv,473,1

To reduce risk of infection, social distancing measures have been implemented. Social contact data, which identify who has contact with whom especially by age and place are needed to identify high-risk groups and serve to inform the design of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We estimated and used negative binomial regression to compare the number of daily contacts during the first wave (April-May 2020) of the Minnesota Social Contact Study, based on respondents age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, and other demographic characteristics. We used information on age and location of contacts to generate age-structured contact matrices.

Design/methodology/approach: Steinmo's (2008) historical institutionalism approach was used in this paper. Secondary data gathering, document analysis and comparative process tracing were employed. Findings: The findings revealed that Vietnam's implementation of its Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases in 2007, its relatively low-cost healthcare system, its efficient mass testing and contact tracing strategies and its science-based decisions are contributory to its success in handling the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Philippines failure to enact its Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act in 2013, its costly and dominantly private healthcare system, its heavy focus on strict, long lockdowns and its militarist methods to control the spread of the pandemic were found to be insufficient. Research limitations/implications: Detailed study on the delivery of healthcare services in marginal areas, healthcare spending for COVID-19 positive individuals and information dissemination strategies about the pandemic were not explored.

DDOTI is capable of responding to an alert in a few minutes, has an instantaneous field of about 69 deg$^{2}$, and obtains $10\sigma$ upper limits of $w_{\rm lim}=18.5$ to 20.5 AB mag in 1000~s of exposure, depending on the conditions. We observed 54\% (26 out of 48) of the unretracted gravitational-wave alerts and did not find any electromagnetic counterparts. We compare our upper limits to various possible counterparts: the kilonova AT~2017gfo, models of radioactive- and magnetar-powered kilonovae, short gamma-ray burst afterglows, and AGN flares. Although the large positional uncertainties of GW sources do not allow us to place strong constraints during O3, DDOTI observations of well-localized GW events in O4 and beyond could meaningfully constrain models of compact binary mergers. We show that DDOTI is able to detect kilonovae similar to AT~2017gfo up to about 200~Mpc and magnetar-powered kilonovae up to 1~Gpc. We calculate that nearby ($\lesssim$200 Mpc) afterglows have a high chance ($\approx$70\%) to be detected by rapid ($\lesssim$3 hours) DDOTI observations if observed on-axis, whereas off-axis afterglows are unlikely to be seen. Finally, we suggest that long-term monitoring of massive BBH events with DDOTI could confirm or rule out late AGN flares associated with these events.","Becerra, R. L.; Dichiara, S.; Watson, A.

Trust in institutions might be a key factor in the way countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic deal with the crisis as people might be more willing to accept the restrictions and rules imposed if they trust the key institutions and people involved in managing the pandemic. The paper provides recommendations for key stakeholders to increase trust in people and institutions in times of crisis. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw evidence from a national online panel survey (N = 1,160) to investigate the main predictors of trust in this context. Findings: The main results indicate that trust in institutions is positively correlated with news consumption and personal discussions about the pandemic, perceived incidence of COVID-19 fake news, belief in conspiracy theories and uncertainty about the future of the country. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, this study is one of the few papers investigating the predictors of trust in the institutions and people involved in managing the current pandemic in a country in the Central and Eastern European region. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bârgăoanu, A.; Corbu, N.; Buturoiu, R.; Durach, F.",Kybernetes,473,11

The focus throughout the study is on the need to permanently support the development of Romanian regions in direct relation to the sustainable indicators presented within the model—through the use of data from empirical analysis—which are measures of Romania’s economic prosperity and long-term economic growth. Therefore, the study intends to assess the progress of each region of the country, showing the evolution and selection of factors that are related to sustainability, namely, child survival, poverty and education, with implications for regional development strategies and local initiatives that must promote wider sustainable regional development. Furthermore, the aim of the study is to analyse the influence of sustainable inflows on economic prosperity, reflected in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for each region in Romania, considering factors related to sustainability and the major differences between the regions, depending on the effectiveness of these public policy applications. With this approach, our goal—considering all the macroregions of the country—is to emphasize the significance of two main aims in sustainable regional development: a better allocation of the means which actively aim to decrease the unemployment rate and a better infrastructure for public services. National, regional and local administrations play important roles in promoting coherent sustainability in economic, social and environmental activities. Regardless of the level at which development policies are devised—local, county or regional—they must take into consideration and monitor the determinants of sustainable development in cases where development is the ultimate goal.","Ibinceanu Onica Mihaela, Cristina Cristache Nicoleta Dobrea Răzvan Cătălin Florescu Margareta",Sustainability,473,16

This risk might not abide by the end of the pandemic. This paper seeks to understand whether people with severe mental ill health (SMI) have the necessary digital skills to adapt to these changes and avoid digital exclusion. Methods: 249 adults with SMI across England completed a survey online or offline. They provided information on their digital skills based on the Essential Digital Skills (EDS) framework, sociodemographic information, and digital access. This is the first time the EDS is benchmarked in people with SMI. Results: 42.2% had no Foundation Skills and 46.2% lacked skills for daily life (lacking Foundation or Life Skills). 23.0% of those working lacked skills for professional life (lacking Foundation or Work Skills). The most commonly missing skills were handling passwords and using the device settings (Foundation Skills) and online problem solving (Skills for Life). People were interested in learning more about approximately half of the skills they did not have. People were more likely to lack Foundation Skills if they were older, not in employment, had a psychosis-spectrum disorder, or had no Internet access at home. Conclusion: A significant portion of people with SMI lacked Foundation Skills in this objective and benchmarked survey. This points to a high risk for digital exclusion and the need for focused policy and tailored health sector support, to ensure people retain access to key services and develop digital skills and confidence. To our knowledge this is the first time this has been described using the Essential Digital Skills (EDS) framework. Services, including the NHS, need to be aware and mitigate the risks.","Spanakis, P.; Wadman, R.; Walker, L.; Heron, P.; Mathers, A.; Baker, J.; Johnston, G.; Gilbody, S.; Peckham, E.",,473,16

This study examined how the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic affected the amount of electricity and natural gas consumption in four organized industrial zones in the Turkey. A significant decrease was observed in electricity and natural gas consumption amounts in April and May when lockdowns were also applied in four industrial zones. In April, electricity consumption decreased between 72 and 43%, and natural gas consumption decreased between 77 and 57%. In May, electricity consumption decreased between 60 and 32%, and natural gas consumption decreased between 69 and 45%. These decreases in industrial zones show that the economy has been significantly affected. Furthermore, in this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Holt-Winters models were developed to predict electricity and natural gas consumption of an industrial zone. ARIMA(0,0,2)(2,1,0)7 and ARIMA(0,0,2)(0,1,1)7 models were chosen as the best model for the electricity and natural gas consumption data respectively with a minimum MAPEElectricity was 1.37%, RMSEElectricity was 87.2, R2Electricity was 0.99, MAPEGas was 5.42% and RMSEGas was 50.9, R2Gas was 0.92. Electricity and natural gas consumption was forecasted for the next ten days (10–19 March 2021) according to ARIMA models with 80% and 95% confidence intervals. In addition, in this study, the impact of low energy usage in the industrial zone due to the COVID-19 lockdowns on model prediction performance was also examined.

Here we use detailed surveillance data gathered during COVID 19 resurgences in six cities of China at the beginning of 2021 to investigate this question. Data were collected by multiple rounds of city wide PCR test with detailed contact tracing, where each patient was monitored for symptoms through the whole course of infection. We find that the proportion of asymptomatic infections declines with age (coefficient =-0.006, P<0.01), falling from 56% in age group 0~9 years to 12% in age group >60 years. Using an age-stratified compartment model, we show that this age-dependent asymptomatic pattern together with the age distribution of overall cases can explain most of the geographic differences in reported asymptomatic proportions. Combined with demography and contact matrices from other countries worldwide, we estimate that a maximum of 22%~55% of SARS CoV 2 infections would come from asymptomatic cases in an uncontrolled epidemic based on asymptomatic proportions in China. Our analysis suggests that flare ups of COVID 19 are likely if only adults are vaccinated and that surveillance and possibly control measures among children will be still needed in the future to contain epidemic resurgence.","Wang, Z.; Wu, P.; Wang, J.; Lourenco, J.; Li, B.; Rader, B.; Laine, M.; Miao, H.; Wang, L.; Song, H.; Bharti, N.; Brownstein, J.; Bjornstad, O.

The major disadvantage of this technique is that mechanical disturbances to the electrodes are in the same frequency and magnitude range as the desired signal. In this work we propose an approach and a realized measurement system to combine EMG and bioimpedance measurements for higher reliabilities of muscle contraction detections. Methods: We propose the development of a modular four-channel measurement system, whereat each channel is capable of acquiring EMG, the bioimpedance magnitude and phase, simultaneously. The modules are synchronized by an additional interface board, which communicates with a PC. A graphical user interface enables to control the bioimpedance excitation current in a range from 100 {\mu}A to 1 mA in a frequency range from 50 kHz to 333 kHz. Results: A system characterization demonstrated that bioimpedance magnitude changes of less than 250 ppm and phase changes below 0.05{\deg} can be detected reliably. Measurements from a subject have shown the timing relationship between EMG and bioimpedance signals as well as their robustness against mechanical disturbances. A measurement of five exemplary hand gestures has demonstrated the increase of usable information for detecting muscle contractions. Conclusion: Bioimpedance measurements of muscles provide useful information about contractions. Furthermore, the usage of a known high-frequency excitation current enables a reliable differentiation between the actual information and disturbances. Significance: By combining EMG and bioimpedance measurements, muscle contractions can be detected much more reliably. This setup can be adopted to prostheses and many other human-computer interfaces.","Kusche, Roman; Ryschka, Martin",,473,16

Material and methods: Using an ordered probit model, we analysed the wine consumption frequency as a function of a set of explanatory variables related to psychological factors and also sociodemographic variables, motivation-related variables and consumption characterisation. Main results: For Spanish respondents the fear of isolation was a decisive factor in increasing the probability of a higher frequency of wine consumption. Meanwhile, in Portugal, the fear of an economic crisis was the psychological factor leading to a higher consumption frequency. Research highlights: In both countries, psychological factors influenced the frequency of wine consumption during the lockdown due to Covid-19. However, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis has been felt differently in Spain and Portugal. Differences can be observed in both psychological and behavioural attitudes that have influenced the frequency of wine consumption and could also indicate significant cultural differences.","Rebelo, J.; Compes, R.; Faria, S.; Goncalves, T.; Pinilla, V.; Simon-Elorz, K.",Spanish Journal of Agricultural Research,473,16

This is increasingly relevant in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, particularly since the introduction of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). This invasive species now occupies up to 90% of fish biomass, with hugely detrimental impacts on native fauna and flora. To address the ongoing impacts of carp, cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) has been proposed as a potentially effective biological control. Crucially, however, it is unknown whether CyHV-3 and other cyprinid herpesviruses already exist in the Murray-Darling. Further, little is known about those viruses that naturally occur in wild freshwater fauna, and the frequency with which these viruses jump species boundaries. To document the evolution and diversity of freshwater fish viromes and better understand the ecological context to the proposed introduction of CyHV-3, we performed a meta-transcriptomic viral survey of invasive and native fish across the Murray-Darling Basin, covering over 2,200 km of the river system. Across a total of 36 RNA libraries representing 10 species, we failed to detect CyHV-3 nor any closely related viruses. Rather, meta-transcriptomic analysis identified 18 vertebrate-associated viruses that could be assigned to the Arenaviridae, Astroviridae, Bornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Chuviridae, Flaviviridae, Hantaviridae, Hepeviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae families, and a further 27 that were deemed to be associated with non-vertebrate hosts. Notably, we revealed a marked lack of viruses that are shared among invasive and native fishes sampled here, suggesting that there is little virus transmission from common carp to native fish species. Overall, this study provides the first data on the viruses naturally circulating in a major river system and supports the notion that fish harbour a large diversity of viruses with often deep evolutionary histories. Author Summary The ongoing invasion of the common carp in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, has wreaked havoc on native freshwater ecosystems. This has stimulated research into the possible biological control of invasive carp through the deliberate release of the virus cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3). However, little is known on the diversity of viruses that naturally circulate in wild freshwater fauna, whether these viruses are transmitted between invasive and native species, nor if CyHV-3 or other cyprinid herpesviruses are already present in the basin. To address these fundamental questions we employed meta-transcriptomic next-generation sequencing to characterise the total assemblage of viruses (i.e. the viromes) in three invasive and seven native fish species cohabiting at 10 sites across 2,200 km of the river system. From this analysis we identified 18 vertebrate-associated viruses across 14 viral families, yet a marked lack of virus transmission between invasive and native species. Importantly, no CyHV-3 was detected. This study shows that freshwater fish harbour a high diversity and abundance of viruses, that viruses have likely been associated with fish for millennia, and that there is likely little direct virus transmission between introduced and native species.","Costa, Vincenzo A.; Mifsud, Jonathon C.O.; Gilligan, Dean; Williamson, Jane E.; Holmes, Edward C.; Geoghegan, Jemma L.",bioRxiv,473,16

Although effective vaccines against the disease have been developed, there are still points to be clarified about the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of COVID-19. In this study, we determined the binding energies and the bond types of complexes formed by open (6VYB) and closed (6VXX) forms of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and wild and mutant forms of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins using the molecular docking approach. First, all missense SNPs were found in the NCBI Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) for IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 and analyzed with SIFT, PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, SNAP2, Mutation Assessor, and PANTHER cSNP web-based tools to determine their pathogenicity. When at least four of these analysis tools showed that the SNP had a pathogenic effect on the protein product, this SNP was saved for further analysis. Delta delta G (DDG) and protein stability analysis for amino acid changes were performed in the web-based tools I-Mutant, MUpro, and SAAFEC-SEQ. The structural effect of amino acid change on the protein product was made using the HOPE web-based tool. HawkDock server was used for molecular docking and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) analysis and binding energies of all complexes were calculated. BIOVIA Discovery Studio program was utilized to visualize the complexes. Hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and non-bonded contacts between Spike and IFITM protein chains in the complexes were detected with the PDBsum web-based tool. The best binding energy among the 6VYB-IFITM wild protein complexes belong to 6VYB-IFITM1 (-46.16 kcal/mol). Likewise, among the 6VXX-IFITM wild protein complexes, the most negative binding energy belongs to 6VXX-IFITM1 (-52.42 kcal/mol). An interesting result found in the study is the presence of hydrogen bonds between the cytoplasmic domain of the IFITM1 wild protein and the S2 domain of 6VYB. Among the Spike-IFITM mutant protein complexes, the best binding energy belongs to the 6VXX-IFITM2 N63S complex (-50.77 kcal/mol) and the worst binding energy belongs to the 6VXX-IFITM3 S50T complex (4.86 kcal/mol). The study suggests that IFITM1 protein may act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Assays must be advanced from in silico to in vitro for the determination of the receptor-ligand interactions between IFITM proteins and SARS-CoV-2.","Giritlioglu, Nazli Irmak; Kucuk, Gizem Koprululu",bioRxiv,473,20

Here, we performed a high-throughput screening of small chemical compounds blocking active Rac1 proteasomal degradation triggered by the Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor-1 (CNF1) toxin, followed by orthogonal screens against two AB toxins hijacking defined endolysosomal (Diphtheria toxin) or retrograde (Shiga-like toxin 1) pathways to intoxicate cells. This led to the identification of the molecule N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-1-propyl-4-piperidinamine, referred to as C910. This compound induces the swelling of EEA1-positive early endosomes, in absence of PIKfyve kinase inhibition, and disturbs the trafficking of CNF1 and the B-subunit of Shiga toxin along the endolysosomal or retrograde pathways, respectively. Together, we show that C910 protects cells against 8 bacterial AB toxins including large clostridial glucosylating toxins from Clostridium difficile. Of interest, C910 also reduced viral infection in vitro including influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, parenteral administration of C910 to the mice resulted in its accumulation in lung tissues and reduced lethal influenza infection.","Wu, Yu; Mahtal, Nassim; Swistak, Léa; Sagadiev, Sara; Acharya, Mridu; Demeret, Caroline; van der Werf, Sylvie; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Schwartz, Olivier; Petracchini, Serena; Mettouchi, Amel; Paillares, Eléa; Caramelle, Lucie; Couvineau, Pierre; Thai, Robert; Barbe, Peggy; Keck, Mathilde; Brodin, Priscille; Machelart, Arnaud; Sencio, Valentin; Trottein, François; Sachse, Martin; Chicanne, Gaëtan; Payrastre, Bernard; Ville, Florian; Kreis, Victor; Popoff, Michel-Robert; Johannes, Ludger; Cintrat, Jean-Christophe; Barbier, Julien; Gillet, Daniel; Lemichez, Emmanuel",bioRxiv,473,1

For this purpose, a telephone consultation was established for the discussion of medical findings and for the planning of procedures as part of the aftercare. The aim of this study is to measure the quality of care in telephonic patient care. Method Following a medical teleconsultation, patients were given a standardised questionnaire (EvaSys) and the quality of the interviews was queried according to defined criteria (general, technical implementation/organisation, content, summary). Results In terms of technical implementation, the majority considered the quality of the connection, timeframes and punctual contact to be good. Findings and further proceedings were largely well understood in terms of content, own concerns could be expressed, there was room for questions and despite tumor disease and possible anatomical limitations, communication was sufficiently possible. The lack of travel and the lower waiting time were perceived positively, but the majority of patients lacked physical examination and the inclusion of relatives. Conclusion The establishment of a telephone consultation is not considered a substitute for personal appointments, but seems to be feasible for selected contacts. It means conserving resources, increasing safety for patients and medical staff, and increasing time efficiency. Despite the mentioned advantages in time, travel, etc., the lack of involving relatives and the lack of physical examination lead to the overwhelming desire for a personal presentation.","Kugler, A.; Balster, S.; Stöver, T.",Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,473,1

The infection SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes, ranging from mild upper respiratory infection to life-threatening cardiovascular complications in humans. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, endotelitis and immune-thrombosis are typical examples that thrombosis and inflammation mutually reinforce each other. Among the basic features of the COVID-19 disease are the endothelial vascular changes affecting the whole vascular system and leading to micro-thrombosis, mainly localized in the pulmonary microcirculation. The anticoagulants are gold stone of the therapy also for its increased anti-inflammatory and endothelial protective activity. Patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and therefore pharmacologic prophylaxis with use of low-molecular-weight heparin, or fondaparinux is recommended not only when hospitalized but also after discharge for up to 45 days in patients at high risk for VTE and low risk of bleeding, independently of the patient recovering mobility. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, standard initial parenteral anticoagulation with therapeutic weight adjusted doses is suggested. In general, a one-size-fits-all strategy cannot be applied to COVID-19 patients. These patients need an individualized approach carefully balancing thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk.

Model results suggest that placing suspected COVID-19 patients in single rooms or bays has the potential to reduce hospital-acquired infections in patients by up to 35%. Periodic testing of HCWs has a smaller effect on the number of hospital-acquired COVID-19 cases in patients, but reduces infection in HCWs by as much as 37% and results in only a small proportion of staff absences (approx. 0.3% per day).

Meanwhile, water penetration into the nasal cavity (istinsyaq) and out (istintsar) during ablution corresponds to the nasal rinse and gargling methods, which prevents the mechanical and chemical attachment of viruses. This article discusses the role of Islamic-based nasal rinse and gargling in the prevention of COVID-19 infection. Various solutions such as plain water, saline, povidone-iodine, and antiseptics have chemical effects. Gargling and nasal rinse mechanically and chemically wash the mucosal surface in the mouth and nose to prevent the attachment of virus and other pathogens. Mechanically, the difference in concentration causes water to move outside the cell by osmosis, reducing mucus secretion and releasing the virus. Meanwhile, a chemical mechanism occurs when the free iodine in povidone-iodine oxidizes fatty acids and damages the virus cell walls and the respiratory chain of cytosolic enzymes, hence preventing inflammation of the host cell. However, the choice of liquid type, concentration, duration, and frequency of use still need to be considered to prevent side effects. © 2021, Sanglah General Hospital.

Eye tracking data has often been investigated to achieve this ability, with reports on the limited role of standard blink metrics. Here, we propose a new approach to the analysis of eye-blink responses for automated estimation of task difficulty. The core module is a time-frequency representation of eye-blink, which aims to capture the richness of information reflected on blinking. In our first study, we show that this method significantly improves the sensitivity to task difficulty. We then demonstrate how to form a framework where the represented patterns are analyzed with multi-dimensional Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks for their non-linear mapping onto difficulty-related parameters. This framework outperformed other methods that used hand-engineered features. This approach works with any built-in camera, without requiring specialized devices. We conclude by discussing how Rethinking Eye-blink can benefit real-world applications.","Cho, Youngjun",,473,1

There has been limited research on the impact of anticoagulant and antiplatelet choice in COVID-19. We performed a single-centre retrospective cohort study of 933 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, investigating the impact of anticoagulation and antiplatelet medication choice on survival and thromboembolism development. Methods This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of 933 patients with COVID-19 infection presenting between 01/02/2020 and 31/05/2020. Survival time at 90 days postdiagnosis and thromboembolism development were the measured outcomes. Patients were grouped by anticoagulant use on first presentation (direct oral anticoagulant, warfarin, therapeutic low molecular weight heparin, and no anticoagulation) and antiplatelet use on admission (aspirin, clopidogrel, dual antiplatelet therapy, or no antiplatelet therapy). Information on pre-existing cardiovascular disease and thromboembolism risk factors was also collected to adjust for confounding variables. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 27.0.1.0. Results Of 933 total patients, mean age was 68 years and 54.4% were male. 297 (31.8%) did not survive at 90 days. A Cox proportional hazards model analysis found no statistically significant relationship between anticoagulant or antiplatelet choice and survival (p&lt;0.05). 57 (6.3%) developed thromboembolism. Antiplatelet choice was not shown to have a statistically significant relationship with thromboembolism development. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use did not have a statistically significant impact on thromboembolism development (p&lt;0.05). Therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) use was associated with increased thromboembolism risk (Odds ratio = 14.327, 95% CI 1.904 - 107.811, p = 0.010).Additionally, neither ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or arrhythmia history were found to be associated with decreased survival at 90 days or increased thromboembolism development. Conclusions Antiplatelet choice was shown to have no impact on survival or thromboembolism development in COVID-19. No patient on dual antiplatelet therapy developed thromboembolism, but this was not found to be statistically significant in multivariate analysis and the sample size was limited (n=7). Anticoagulant choice did not impact survival or thromboembolism development, aside from LMWH. Therapeutic LMWH use was associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. Again, it should be noted that the sample size for patients using therapeutic LMWH was small (n=4), and there may be confounding variables affecting both LMWH use and thromboembolism development. The findings relating to the impact of dual antiplatelet therapy and therapeutic LMWH use on thromboembolism development in COVID-19 should be repeated with a larger sample size and additional adjustment for cofounding variables.","Salmon, T.; Titley, M.; Noori, Z.; Crosby, M.; Sankaranarayanan, R.",Heart,473,20

Smoking has been shown to increase the severity of COVID-19 infection and the consequent risk for intra-tracheal ventilation in smokers. Tobacco smoking exposes the user and nearby individuals to very high concentrations of particulate matter in a short period of time. Genes appertaining to COVID-19 have been found adherent to particulate matter. Particulate matter has been shown to travel beyond the social distance of 2 metres up to 10 metres. COVID-19 related mortality has been linked to elevated atmospheric levels of the particulate matter, PM2.5. The aim of the study was to observe the incidence of infection rate and case fatality ratios in the USA, comparing States with partial bans on tobacco smoking, to States with more restrictive smoking regulation, exploring a possible link between smoke-related particulate matter and COVID-19 transmission. METHODOLOGYTwo groups of USA States, differentiated by the degree of smoking legislative restrictions, had a number of variables compared. The incidence of COVID-19 infection, case-fatality ratio and testing frequency were obtained from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre. The degree of smoking bans in the USA States was obtained from the websites of the Nonsmokers Rights Foundation. The percentage of the State population which smokes was collected from the Centres of Disease Control database. Population density, Body Mass Index and population percentages of individuals 65+/75+years were obtained from databases concerning USA demographics. RESULTSWith the available data there was no significant difference in COVID-19 testing prevalence between the partial smoking ban group and the more restrictive regulated group. The incidence of COVID-19 infection in the States with limited bans on tobacco smoking was 2046/100,000 (sd+/-827) while the infection incidence in States with more restrictive rulings on tobacco smoking was 1660/100,000 (sd+/-686) (p<0.038). The population percentage of smokers in States with minor limitations to smoking was 18.3% (sd+/-3.28), while States with greater smoking restrictions had a smoking population percentage of 15.2% (sd+/-2.68) (p<0.0006). The two populations of both groups did not differ numerically (p<0.24) and numbered 157,820,000 in the partial smoking ban group and 161,439,356 in the more restrictive group. Population density correlated significantly with the case-fatality ratio (R=0.66 p<0.0001), as did the 75+year age group (R=0.29 p<0.04). Reflecting the possibility of trans-border transmission, the smoking status of adjacent partial smoking ban States may influence the COVID-19 incidence of bordering States (e.g. Utah) even if the smoking regulations of the latter were stricter than the former. Other factors that could impact the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA such as the State case-fatality ratio, population density, population percentage with elevated body mass index and the percentage of the state population aged 65years or above did not show any significant difference between both groups of States. CONCLUSIONStates in the USA with high levels of tobacco smoking and limited regulation had significantly higher rates of COVID-19 infection incidences than States with greater smoking restrictions. Population density and the age group of 75+years, showed a positive significant correlation with the case-fatality ratio. Besides the adverse effects of tobacco smoking on pulmonary defences, it would be interesting to explore the possibility of infection transmission via coronavirus-laden particulate matter from exhaled fumes derived from tobacco smoking.","Baron, Yves Muscat",,473,16

In particular, SARS-CoV-2 is currently a major threat to public health worldwide. However, no commercial vaccines against the coronaviruses that can infect humans are available. The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing). Then, structural and immunological analyses were used to explore differences in the immune response with RBDs among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that more RBD-specific antibodies were induced by the S trimer with the RBD in the “standing” state (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) than the S trimer with the RBD in the “lying” state (HCoV-229E), and the affinity between the RBD-specific antibodies and S trimer was also higher in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we found that the ability of the HCoV-229E RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies was much lower and the intact and stable S1 subunit was essential for producing efficient neutralizing antibodies against HCoV-229E. Importantly, our results reveal different vaccine strategies for coronaviruses, and S-trimer is better than RBD as a target for vaccine development in Alpha-coronavirus. Our findings will provide important implications for future development of coronavirus vaccines. Importance Outbreak of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV-2, poses a serious threat to global public health. Development of vaccines to prevent the coronaviruses that can infect humans has always been a top priority. Coronavirus spike (S) protein is considered as a major target for vaccine development. Currently, structural studies have shown that Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) RBDs are in lying and standing state, respectively. Here, we tested the ability of S-trimer and RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies among these coronaviruses. Our results showed that Beta-CoVs RBDs are in a standing state, and their S proteins can induce more neutralizing antibodies targeting RBD. However, HCoV-229E RBD is in a lying state, and its S protein induces a low level of neutralizing antibody targeting RBD. Our results indicate that Alpha-coronavirus is more conducive to escape host immune recognition, and also provide novel ideas for the development of vaccines targeting S protein.","Shi, Yuejun; Shi, Jiale; Sun, Limeng; Tan, Yubei; Wang, Gang; Guo, Fenglin; Hu, Guangli; Fu, Yanan; Fu, Zhen F.; Xiao, Shaobo; Peng, Guiqing",bioRxiv,473,9

Every player in Education sector had to adjust their performance. Teachers and students were unexpectedly thrown to online communication platforms, namely Teams, Zooms, and asked to continue classes on a new framework, without a priori preparation. This teaching style is defined as emergency remote teaching (ERT), contrasting to the planned and designed online learning.

Six nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality are financially costed. The economic crisis and food and health system disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic threaten to exacerbate undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We developed pessimistic, moderate and optimistic scenarios for 2020-2022 and used three modelling tools (MIRAGRODEP, the Lives Saved Tool and Optima Nutrition) to estimate the impacts of pandemic-induced disruptions on child stunting, wasting and mortality, maternal anaemia and children born to women with a low body mass index (BMI) in 118 LMICs. We estimated the cost of six nutrition interventions to mitigate excess stunting and child mortality due to the pandemic and to maximize alive and non-stunted children, and used the human capital approach to estimate future productivity losses. By 2022, COVID-19-related disruptions could result in an additional 9.3 million wasted children and 2.6 million stunted children, 168,000 additional child deaths, 2.1 million maternal anaemia cases, 2.1 million children born to women with a low BMI and US$29.7 billion in future productivity losses due to excess stunting and child mortality.

In this work, we model the transmission and propagation of coronavirus inside the respiratory tract, starting from the nasal area to alveoli using molecular communication theory. We performed experiments using COMSOL, a finite-element multiphysics simulation software, and Python-based simulations to analyze the end-to-end communication model in terms of path loss, delay, and gain. The analytical results show the correlation between the channel characteristics and pathophysiological properties of coronavirus. For the initial 50% of the maximum production rate of virus particles, the path loss increases more than 16 times than the remaining 50%. The delayed response of the immune system and increase in the absorption of virus particles inside the respiratory tract delay the arrival of virus particles at the alveoli.

While small molecule docking simulations are often applied in conjunction with cheminformatic methods to reduce the number of candidate molecules to be tested experimentally, the current approaches suffer from high false positive rates and are computationally expensive. Here, we present a novel in silico approach for drug discovery and repurposing, dubbed connectivity enhanced Structure Activity Relationship (ceSAR) that improves on current methods by combining docking and virtual screening approaches with pharmacogenomics and transcriptional signature connectivity analysis. ceSAR builds on the landmark LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of over 20,000 drug-like molecules and ~5,000 gene knock-downs (KDs) to connect small molecules and their potential targets. For a set of candidate molecules and specific target gene, candidate molecules are first ranked by chemical similarity to their ‘concordant’ LINCS analogs that share signature similarity with a knock-down of the target gene. An efficient method for chemical similarity search, optimized for sparse binary fingerprints of chemical moieties, is used to enable fast searches for large libraries of small molecules. A small subset of candidate compounds identified in the first step is then re-scored by combining signature connectivity with docking simulations. On a set of 20 DUD-E benchmark targets with LINCS KDs, the consensus approach reduces significantly false positive rates, improving the median precision 3-fold over docking methods at the extreme library reduction. We conclude that signature connectivity and docking provide complementary signals, offering an avenue to improve the accuracy of virtual screening while reducing run times by multiple orders of magnitude.","Thorman, Alexander W.; Reigle, James; Chutipongtanate, Somchai; Shamsaei, Behrouz; Pilarczyk, Marcin; Fazel-Najafabadi, Mehdi; Adamczak, Rafal; Kouril, Michal; Morrow, Ardythe L.; Czyzyk-Krzeska, Maria F.; McCullumsmith, Robert; Seibel, William; Nassar, Nicolas; Zheng, Yi; Hildeman, David; Herr, Andrew B.; Medvedovic, Mario; Meller, Jarek",bioRxiv,473,1

The emerging knowledge graphs (KGs) provide an efficient and effective way to organize and retrieval the huge and increasing volume of biomedical knowledge. A biomedical KG (BKG) typically stores and represents knowledge by constructing a semantic network describing entities and the relationships between them. Previous efforts have been conducted to construct and curate BKGs by comprehensively integrating various biomedical data resources. Though the resulting BKGs have made a significant progress in this filed in advancing biological and medical research, there remain a big gap to a perfect one that is comprehensive and fine-grained enough. To this end, in the present study, we collected and integrated data from diverse well-curated biomedical knowledge bases and BKGs to curate a more comprehensive one, named the Cornell Biomedical Knowledge Hub (CBKH). To enhance the usage in accelerating biomedical research, we deployed CBKH using the famous graph database, Neo4j. This is a continuing effort and we are adding in more and more contents in CBKH to support the various complex needs in biomedical data analysis.

Although all these enteropathogens were excreted more frequently by the diarrhoeic than by the healthy calves, the difference was significant overall only for rotavirus. Rotavirus was excreted by 18 per cent of healthy calves, coronavirus by 4 per cent, cryptosporidium by 14 per cent, and no enterotoxigenic E coli or Salmonella species were detected. The most common enteropathogen in diarrhoeic calves was rotavirus, which was excreted by more than half the diarrhoeic calves on 18 farms. Coronavirus was excreted at a similar high prevalence on one farm, cryptosporidium on five farms and enterotoxigenic E coli on three farms. Concurrent infection with two or more microorganisms occurred in 15 per cent of diarrhoeic calves.

However, it is now clear that endemic diseases as well as newly emerging ones (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), reemerging ones (e.g., West Nile virus), and even deliberately disseminated infectious diseases (e.g., anthrax from bioterrorism) continue to pose a substantial threat throughout the world. Over the past several decades, the global effort to identify and characterize infectious agents, decipher the underlying pathways by which they cause disease, and develop preventive measures and treatments for many of the world's most dangerous pathogens has helped control many endemic diseases. But despite considerable progress, infectious diseases continue to present significant challenges as new microbial threats emerge and reemerge. HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, SARS, West Nile virus, Marburg virus, and bioterrorism are examples of some of the emerging and reemerging threats. In responding to these ongoing challenges, a new paradigm in countermeasure development is needed. In the past, U.S. government-sponsored biomedical researchers have focused on basic research and concept development, leaving product development to the pharmaceutical industry. Increasingly, however, the government has become involved in more targeted countermeasure development efforts. In this regard, partnerships between government, industry, and academia are necessary as we struggle to maintain and update our armamentarium in the struggle to outwit the microbes that pose a never-ending threat to mankind.","Fauci, Anthony S",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,473,15

This behavioral study was conducted to determine whether changing the uterine or rearing environment (as is integral to common rederivation methods) would have a significant effect on the expression of the behavioral traits in question. Selected breeding pairs of the affected lines were divided into four treatment groups: 1) transfer of embryos to pseudopregnant B6D2F1 female mice, 2) fostering offspring to B6D2F1 dams, 3) fostering offspring to a different dam of the same line, and 4) offspring raised by the birth dam. Embryo transfers were successful only in one affected line. At approximately 50 days of age, the offspring were tested for locomotor behavior after intraperitoneal administration of ethanol or normal saline. There were no statistically significant effects of embryo transfer on the ethanol phenotype (ethanol-induced locomotor depression). Fostering significantly reduced the stimulant response to ethanol of only one mouse line selectively bred for high sensitivity to ethanol-induced stimulation, although the stimulant response of the fostered groups was still quite robust. Overall, the results of this study showed that eradication efforts involving fostering of offspring have a modest impact on the stimulant response to ethanol, but there were insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding the use of embryo transfer.","Hickman, Debra L; Burkhart-Kasch, Sue; Phillips, Tamara J",Comparative medicine,473,9

Strategies to control emerging diseases will be more effective if competent authorities and veterinary infrastructures in particular, integrate their public and animal health objectives into a single strategy.

This study was thus conducted to determine the incidence and presence of a relationship between the predictors of BMI or CRP and duration of MV in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS This prospective observational study included 72 critically ill trauma patients. Admitted patients were categorized by duration of MV to Group A (< or =7 days) and Group B (>7 days). The biological status of patients was assessed by the serial measurement of CRP on admission to the ICU (T1), at 48 and 72 hours after admission, and on the day of beginning (T2) or discontinuation (T3) of MV. Data on BMI, serum albumin, and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were also collected at T2 or T3. RESULTS At T3, the SOFA score, BMI, albumin, and CRP were significantly higher in patients in Group B compared with Group A (p<0.01). The incidence of low BMI (< or =20 kg/m2) or high CRP (>10 mg/L) in patients in Group B was significantly higher at T2 or T3 compared with Group A (p<0.05). At T3, CRP was determined as the most powerful predictor of >7 days of MV followed by BMI. CONCLUSION Both BMI and CRP, comparable with the SOFA score, can be used in estimating the risk of prolonged MV.","Honarmand, Azim; Safavi, Mohammadreza",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,473,10

In addition to the 18-kDa integral membrane protein M and the 15-kDa nucleocapsid protein N, two new structural proteins with molecular masses of 45 to 50 kDa and 31 to 35 kDa, respectively, were detected. Monoclonal antibodies that recognized proteins of 45 to 50 kDa and 31 to 35 kDa immunoprecipitated similar proteins expressed from open reading frames (ORFs) 3 and 4 in baculovirus recombinants, respectively. Therefore, the 45- to 50-kDa protein is encoded by ORF3 and the 31- to 35-kDa protein is encoded by ORF4. Peptide-N-glycosidase F digestion of purified virus reduced the 45- to 50-kDa and 31- to 35-kDa proteins to core proteins of 29 and 16 kDa, respectively, which indicates N glycosylation of these proteins in the virion. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the 31- to 35-kDa protein neutralized Lelystad virus, which indicates that at least part of this protein is exposed at the virion surface. We propose that the 45- to 50-kDa and 31- to 35-kDa structural proteins of Lelystad virus be named GP3 and GP4, to reflect their glycosylation and the ORFs from which they are expressed. Antibodies specific for GP3 and GP4 were detected by a Western immunoblotting assay in swine serum after an infection with Lelystad virus.","van Nieuwstadt, A P; Meulenberg, J J; van Essen-Zanbergen, A; Petersen-den Besten, A; Bende, R J; Moormann, R J; Wensvoort, G",Journal of virology,473,1

OBJECTIVES To determine whether lung transplant recipients can be chronically infected by rhinovirus and the potential clinical impact. METHODS We first identified an index case, in which rhinovirus was isolated repeatedly, and conducted detailed molecular analysis to determine whether this was related to a unique strain or to re-infection episodes. Transbronchial biopsies were used to assess the presence of rhinovirus in the lung parenchyma. The incidence of chronic rhinoviral infections and potential clinical impact was assessed prospectively in a cohort of 68 lung transplant recipients during 19 mo by screening of bronchoalveolar lavages. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We describe 3 lung transplant recipients with graft dysfunctions in whom rhinovirus was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in upper and lower respiratory specimens over a 12-mo period. In two cases, rhinovirus was repeatedly isolated in culture. The persistence of a unique strain in each case was confirmed by sequence analysis of the 5'NCR and VP1 gene. In the index case, rhinovirus was detected in the lower respiratory parenchyma. In the cohort of lung transplant recipients, rhinoviral infections were documented in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of 10 recipients, and 2 presented with a persistent infection. CONCLUSIONS Rhinoviral infection can be persistent in lung transplant recipients with graft dysfunction, and the virus can be detected in the lung parenchyma. Given the potential clinical impact, chronic rhinoviral infection needs to be considered in lung transplant recipients.","Kaiser, Laurent; Aubert, John-David; Pache, Jean-Claude; Deffernez, Christelle; Rochat, Thierry; Garbino, Jorge; Wunderli, Werner; Meylan, Pascal; Yerly, Sabine; Perrin, Luc; Letovanec, Igor; Nicod, Laurent; Tapparel, Caroline; Soccal, Paola M",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,473,8

However, several questions remain unanswered regarding the prescription of steroids which led to differing opinions and practice. We surveyed practice patterns of critical care physicians in India for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Methods This was a nationwide, cross-sectional, online, knowledge attitude practice-based survey, among intensivists for corticosteroid use in COVID-19. The survey questionnaire had seven questions for demographic data and 14 questions in the core survey. Results 384 responses were analyzed from different parts of the country. A majority (81.2%) agreed that steroids improved oxygenation and survival chances. 88.3% agreed that steroids are indicated because of their anti-inflammatory properties, and should be prescribed in patients with moderate (75.8%), severe (59.9%), or critical (41.1%) COVID-19. 68.8% of physicians start steroids on the basis of “need for oxygen therapy” and hyperglycemia (85.2%) was the most commonly reported complication. 59.1% prefer prescribing methylprednisolone followed by Dexamethasone (38.8%). 51.8% preferred to use low dose steroids, and 59.1% have used “pulse steroids’’. Rather than a fixed duration of therapy, 66.9% of the respondents rely on “clinical improvement” before stopping steroids, even if it meant continuing steroids for prolonged periods beyond 14 days (34.1%). 57.8% always taper steroids before stopping. Conclusions We found wide variation in the practice patterns of critical care physicians in India for use of Corticosteroids in COVID-19. The dilemma regarding when to initiate, type of steroid, dose, and duration of therapy still persist emphasizing the need for further research.","Juneja, Deven; Jain, Ravi; Singh, Omender",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,473,1

SUBJECTS AND METHODS Medical records of subjects with BDs admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit over a 5-year period of time were retrospectively reviewed and clinical data were extracted into an electronic dataset. ""Revolving Door Subjects"" (RDS) were defined as those who presented three or more ""Revolving Door Hospitalizations"" (RDH) during twelve months. Features of RDH were compared with non-RDH in order to identify characteristics associated with RD phenomenon and possible risk factors for readmission. To explore predictors of RDH, a stepwise backword logistic regression model was built, including the variables that were significantly associated with RDH in the bivariate analyses. RESULTS In our sample of 176 subjects affected by BDs, 53 (19.9%) RDH were identified. In the RDH group, a higher prevalence of mixed episodes (p=0.029) and medical co-morbidities (p=0.004) was detected. Subjects with repeated hospitalizations were more often committed to psychiatric residential facilities at discharge (p=0.002). Treatment features related to RDH were represented by a higher prescription rate of atypical antipsychotics (p=0.030), benzodiazepines (p=0.001) and antidepressants (p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS Findings from the present study suggest that the early identification and treatment of medical comorbidities and specific clinical features of BDs may help reducing the RD phenomenon in this population of subjects.","Menculini, Giulia; Gobbicchi, Chiara; Verdolini, Norma; Cirimbilli, Federica; Moretti, Patrizia; Tortorella, Alfonso",Psychiatria Danubina,473,19

A. Koetzner, M. M. Parker, C. S. Ricard, L. S. Sturman, and P. S. Masters, J. Virol. 66:1841-1848, 1992). By using a thermolabile N protein mutant of MHV (Alb4) as the recipient virus and synthetic RNA7 (the mRNA for the nucleocapsid protein N) as the donor, we selected engineered recombinant viruses as heat-stable progeny resulting from cotransfection. We have now been able to greatly increase the efficiency of targeted recombination in this process by using a synthetic defective interfering (DI) RNA in place of RNA7. The frequency of recombination is sufficiently high that, with Alb4 as the recipient, recombinants can be directly identified without using thermal selection. The synthetic DI RNA has been used to demonstrate that the lesion in another temperature-sensitive and thermolabile MHV mutant, Alb1, maps to the N gene. Sequencing of the Alb1 N gene revealed two closely linked point mutations that fall in a region of the N molecule previously noted as being the most highly conserved region among all of the coronavirus N proteins. Analysis of revertants of the Alb1 mutant revealed that one of the two mutations is critical for the temperature-sensitive phenotype; the second mutation is phenotypically silent.","Masters, P S; Koetzner, C A; Kerr, C A; Heo, Y",Journal of virology,473,28

Cai et al., Virology 355:152-163, 2006). Here we show that inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway by the MEK inhibitor UO126 significantly impaired MHV progeny production (a reduction of 95 to 99% in virus titer), which correlated with the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2. Moreover, knockdown of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 by small interfering RNAs suppressed MHV replication. The inhibitory effect of UO126 on MHV production appeared to be a general phenomenon since the effect was consistently observed in all six different MHV strains and in three different cell types tested; it was likely exerted at the postentry steps of the virus life cycle because the virus titers were similarly inhibited from infected cells treated at 1 h prior to, during, or after infection. Furthermore, the treatment did not affect the virus entry, as revealed by the virus internalization assay. Metabolic labeling and reporter gene assays demonstrated that translation of cellular and viral mRNAs appeared unaffected by UO126 treatment. However, synthesis of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs was severely suppressed by UO126 treatment, as demonstrated by a reduced incorporation of [3H]uridine and a decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in a defective-interfering RNA-CAT reporter assay. These findings indicate that the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is involved in MHV RNA synthesis.","Cai, Yingyun; Liu, Yin; Zhang, Xuming",Journal of virology,473,19

It is a serious condition which may lead to septicemia and septic embolization. LS is most frequently caused by the anaerobic Fusobacterium necrophorum. In the current post-antibiotic era, it is rare (annual incidence of 0.8 cases/million). Many clinicians are unaware of LS, leading it to be termed ""the forgotten disease."" Signs and symptoms include odynophagia, fever and easy fatigue simulating, among others, infection by COVID-19. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should be started promptly. If a deep abscess is present, drainage is indicated. In cases of persistent sepsis or embolization, surgical ligation/excision of the IJV may be considered. Currently, the most controversial role in LS management is anticoagulation. Compared with pre-antibiotic era mortality has much improved (0-18%). Since 2004 there are only four cases of LS reported in Portugal (Medline). Objectives To report a case of late diagnosis and highlight the pitfalls due to initial suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods Case report. A 37-year-old female presented to our institution with left-sided neck pain, odynophagia and fever. A diagnosis of tonsillitis was made, and the patient was discharged. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal-swab-test was negative. One week later, due to persistent fever, dyspnea, thoracalgia and easy fatigue the patient returned. Blood samples showed increased white-cell-count (17.150/μL) and C-reactive-protein (378 mg/L). On CT, areas of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates were consistent with COVID-19 infection. The patient was transferred to COVID-19 area and started ceftriaxone, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. On day 4, considering 3 negative tests hydroxychloroquine was abandoned. Diagnosis of an atypical pneumonia was made and antibiotherapy was changed to doxycycline and ceftazidime. Due to moderate size pleural effusion a thoracentesis was performed. On day 7, as cervical pain and tumefaction were persisting, a contrast-enhanced cervical CT was ordered, showing peritonsillar thickening and thrombosis of the left IJV with emphysema (Figure 1). Antibiotherapy was changed to Piperacillin-Tazobactam and anticoagulation was started. Results After 2 weeks, inflammatory markers were normal and a reduction in pulmonary opacities was observed. All microbiological cultures were negative. The patient completed the last 3 weeks of antibiotherapy under ambulatory hospitalization. Screening for thrombophilia was negative. Anticoagulation was kept for 3 months. Conclusions In a patient with former oropharyngeal infection presenting with pneumonia, LS should be suspected. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should include anaerobic coverage. Anticoagulation may hasten local infection control and prevent septic embolization, optimizing pneumonia resolution.","Bernardes, Francisco; Soares, Diogo; Ribeiro, Ana; Ferreira, Vítor; Vasconcelos, João; Maia, Miguel; Vidoedo, José; Pinto, João Almeida",Revista portuguesa de cirurgia cardio-toracica e vascular : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cirurgia Cardio-Toracica e Vascular,473,1

Persistently infected cultures released large amounts of virus (10(7) to 10(8) PFU/ml) and were resistant to superinfection with MHV but not to infection with unrelated Semliki Forest and vesicular stomatitis viruses. The culture medium from persistently infected cultures did not contain a soluble inhibitor such as interferon that protected uninfected cells from infection by MHV or vesicular stomatitis virus. The persistent infection was cured if fewer than 100 cells were transferred during subculturing, and such cured cultures were susceptible to reinfection and the reestablishment of persistent infection. Cultures of 17C1-1 cells that had been newly cloned from single cells consisted of a mixture of MHV-resistant and -susceptible cells. 17C1-1/#97 cells, which were cured by subcloning after 97 passages of a persistently infected culture over a 1-year period, contained 5 to 10% of their population as susceptible cells, while 17C1-1/#402 cells, which were cured by subcloning after 402 passages over a 3-year period, had less than 1% susceptible cells. Susceptibility to infection correlated with the expression of MHV receptor glycoprotein (MHVR [Bgp1a]). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with antibody to MHVR showed that 17C1-1/#97 cells contained a small fraction of MHVR-expressing cells. These MHVR-expressing cells were selectively eliminated within 24 h after challenge with MHV-A59, and pretreatment of 17C1-1/#97 cells with monoclonal antibody CC1, which binds to the N-terminal domain of MHVR, blocked infection. We conclude that the subpopulation of MHVR-expressing cells were infected and killed in acutely or persistently infected cultures, while the subpopulation of MHVR-nonexpressing cells survived and proliferated. The subpopulation of MHVR-negative cells produced a small proportion of progeny cells that expressed MHVR and became infected, thereby maintaining the persistent infection as a steady-state carrier culture. Thus, in 17C1-1 cell cultures, the unstable or epigenetic expression of MHVR permitted the establishment of a persistent, chronic infection.","Sawicki, S G; Lu, J H; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,473,26

However, given the speed of this pandemic, paralleled with the pressure to develop and provide serological tests in an expediated manner, not every assay has undergone the rigorous evaluation that is usually associated with medical diagnostic assays. We aimed to examine the performance of several commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assays among participants with confirmed COVID-19 disease and negative controls. Methods Serum taken between day 17 and day 40 post onset of symptoms from 41 healthcare workers with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease, and pre-pandemic serum from 20 negative controls, were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using 7 different assays including point-of-care (POC) and laboratory-based assays. Results Assay performance varied. The lab-based Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay proved to be the assay with the best positive and negative predictive value, and overall accuracy. The POC Nal von Minden GmbH and Biozek assays also performed well. Conclusion Our research demonstrates the variations in performance of several commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. These findings identify the limitations of some serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. This information will help inform test selection and may have particular relevance to providers operating beyond accredited laboratories.","Kerr, C; Dunne, J; Hughes, G; Cox, F; Healy, M; Holmes, P; O'Rourke, F; O'Brien, C; Coyne, D; Crowley, V; Crowley, B; Conlon, N; Bergin, C",Irish medical journal,473,8

The hemagglutinin (HA) protein is the major target of protective antibody responses induced by viral infection and by vaccination with both inactivated and live-attenuated flu vaccines, but knowledge about the optimal designs of protective HA antigens from different flu serotypes is still limited. In this study, we have significantly improved the immunogenicity of HA-expressing DNA vaccines by using codon-optimized HA sequences for either an H1 serotype (A/NewCal/20/99) or an H3 serotype (A/Panama/2007/99) human influenza A virus and then used these constructs as model antigens to identify the optimal HA antigen designs to elicit high-level protective antibody responses. Two forms of HA antigen, a wild-type, full-length HA and a secreted form with transmembrane (TM) domain-truncated HA, were produced. Both forms of HA DNA vaccines, from either H1 or H3 serotypes, were able to elicit high levels of HA-specific immunoglobulin G responses in immunized rabbits as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Interestingly, the abilities of H1 HA and H3 HA antigens to elicit hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses differ. For the H1 HA antigens, the full-length HA induced significantly higher HI and NAb responses than did the TM-truncated HA. For the H3 HA antigen, both the full-length HA and TM-truncated HA induced high levels of HI and NAb responses. These data indicate that H1 and H3 antigens have different expression requirements for the induction of an optimal protective antibody response and that the structure integrity of HA antigens is critical for eliciting type-specific protective antibody responses. Our findings will have an important impact on future subunit-based flu vaccine development.","Wang, Shixia; Taaffe, Jessica; Parker, Christopher; Solórzano, Alicia; Cao, Hong; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Lu, Shan",Journal of virology,473,19

Not only China, the first country that experienced the health crisis since last December, but the rest of the world, is facing an unprecedented global health crisis, the most serious crisis in a century, with social and economic impact. However, the most important impact of the new pandemic is the human impact. Till 4th of June 2020, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 65000.000 people and has been responsible for more than 386000 deaths globally. The first priority of public health authorities is to contain and mitigate the spread and infection rate of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, distributing the number of infections over time and, if possible, reduce the incidence of the disease (COVID-19) it causes. A critical task for health systems confronted with the spread of the coronavirus is to protect the health of all citizens, so this requires that both diagnosis/testing and appropriate care should be readily available, affordable, and provided in a safe environment. The health care systems of many developed countries failed to demonstrate a satisfactory response to the increased demand for acute care hospital beds, ventilators, emergency services, diagnostics tests, support equipment for their COVID-19 patients, availability of essential medicines, protective equipment for their staff etc. Nuclear Medicine (NM) departments and their staff, in spite of the fact that not being in the front line of the pandemic response, have experienced a dramatic alteration in their daily clinical activity, trying to adapt their clinical routine to the new environment. There are several issued guidance from national and international organizations, trying to help to cope with suspected or verified COVID-19 patients.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patients 20 years or younger with clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory evidence of SARS from March to July 2003 vs children with virus culture-confirmed influenza in a 1:1 age- and sex-matched control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Rates of symptoms, abnormal laboratory data, and outcomes of recovery, sequelae, or death. RESULTS The 15 SARS patients (9 girls and 6 boys) had a median age of 17 years (age range, 4-20 years). Nine patients (60%) were infected through household contact, 4 (27%) nosocomially, 1 (7%) through contact with a neighbor, and 1 (7%) after returning from Hong Kong. All 15 patients had fever, 3 (20%) had chills, and 11 (73%) had cough. Only 1 patient (7%) had sputum production; 1 (7%) had rhinorrhea. At presentation, 5 patients (33%) had leukopenia, 6 (40%) had lymphopenia, and 5 (33%) had monocytopenia. All children recovered without sequelae. Children with SARS had significantly lower incidences of rhinorrhea (odds ratio [OR], 0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-0.09), sputum production (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.63), and sore throat (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.85) than children with influenza. Both groups had similar incidences of leukopenia or lymphopenia, but SARS patients had a significantly higher incidence of monocytopenia (33% vs 0%, P = .04).

This study evaluated the profiles and outcomes of children referred for developmental and behavioural concerns to a tertiary child developmental centre in Singapore. This is the first such regional database. METHODS Baseline information, obtained through a questionnaire, together with history at first consultation, provided information for referral, demographic and presentation profiles. Clinical formulations were then made. Definitive developmental and medical diagnoses, as well as outcomes based on clinical assessment and standardised testing, were recorded at one year post first consultation. RESULTS Out of 1,304 referrals between January 1, 2003 and December 1, 2004, 45% were 2-4 years old and 74% were boys. The waiting time from referral to first consultation exceeded four months in 52% of children. Following clinical evaluation, 7% were found to be developmentally appropriate. The single most common presenting concern was speech and language (S&L) delay (29%). The most common clinical developmental diagnosis was autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (30%), followed by isolated S&L disorder, global developmental delay (GDD) and cognitive impairment (CI). Recommendations included S&L therapy (57%), occupational therapy (50%) and psychological/behavioural services (40%). At one year, ASD remained the most common definitive developmental diagnosis (31%), followed by S&L disorder, CI and GDD. Most were children with high-prevalence, low-moderate severity disorders who could potentially achieve fair-good prognosis with early intervention. CONCLUSION Better appreciation of the profile and outcome of children with CDABD in Singapore could enable better resource planning for diagnosis and intervention.","Lian, Wee Bin; Ho, Selina Kah Ying; Choo, Sylvia Hean Tean; Shah, Varsha Atul; Chan, Daisy Kwai Lin; Yeo, Cheo Lian; Ho, Lai Yun",Singapore medical journal,473,21

Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and antibody responses in a large sample of healthcare workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate, or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. RESULTS: Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non-COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. CONCLUSION: We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset. Our data also suggest that exposure to COVID-19 positive co-workers in a hospital setting is not leading to the development of measurable immune responses in a significant proportion of asymptomatic contact persons.","Brandstetter, Susanne; Roth, Samra; Harner, Susanne; Buntrock-Döpke, Heike; Toncheva, Antoaneta A; Borchers, Natascha; Gruber, Rudolf; Ambrosch, Andreas; Kabesch, Michael",Pediatr. allergy immunol,473,16

To fill in this gap, we characterized COVID-19 patients at the time at which they were diagnosed in outpatient settings and estimated 30-day hospital admission and fatality rates. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study. : Data were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP)-a primary-care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and hospital emergency, inpatient and mortality registers. We included all patients in the database who were &#8805;15 years old and diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings between 15 March and 24 April 2020 (10 April for outcome studies). Baseline characteristics included socio-demographics, co-morbidity and previous drug use at the time of diagnosis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and results. : Study outcomes included 30-day hospitalization for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality. RESULTS: We identified 118 150 and 95 467 COVID-19 patients for characterization and outcome studies, respectively. Most were women (58.7%) and young-to-middle-aged (e.g. 21.1% were 45-54 years old). Of the 44 575 who were tested with PCR, 32 723 (73.4%) tested positive. In the month after diagnosis, 14.8% (14.6-15.0) were hospitalized, with a greater proportion of men and older people, peaking at age 75-84 years. Thirty-day fatality was 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.4% to 3.6%), higher in men, increasing with age and highest in those residing in nursing homes [24.5% (23.4% to 25.6%)]. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infections were widespread in the community, including all age-sex strata. However, severe forms of the disease clustered in older men and nursing-home residents. Although initially managed in outpatient settings, 15% of cases required hospitalization and 4% died within a month of first symptoms.

Such digital texts have attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden evolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing approaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a current topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition, these approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring latent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance degradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all prior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the multi-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between evolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across time steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with a set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully discomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate model is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the inference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter algorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form. In addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is exploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the sparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against the competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in terms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document time prediction.","Guo, Jinjin; Cao, Longbing; Gong, Zhiguo",,473,16

In this exploratory study, we aim to learn from students’ feedback on demands created by COVID-19 forced e-learning to provide HEI management with insights helpful in building educational policies that might promote students’ positive perception of distance learning in turbulent times. Based on a convenience sample of more than 600 university students we implemented multiple regression analysis to explore the relationships between e-learning demands experienced by students and the three dimensions of e-learning perception: emotional experience with e-learning, cognitive evaluation of e-learning, and study engagement in e-learning. Our findings have shown that the e-learning demand most strongly related to a negative perception of e-learning was students’ belief that during e-learning the university was plunged into chaos. This suggests that for students who participate in e-learning, the most important aspect of e-learning policy might be not, as we often intuitively think, the cutting edge e-learning platform & technology but rather effective reciprocal communication between HEI and students about the e-learning situation, allowing a perception of order to be created.

Although respiratory involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is well known, the potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular manifestations are less understood. We performed a PubMed and Google Scholar search and reviewed relevant literature on COVID-19 and cardiovascular system involvement. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 possesses high affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is highly concentrated in the lungs and cardiovascular tissue, thereby provoking concern for cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 cases. Preexisting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease has been shown in previous reports to be a risk factor for severe infection. On the basis of our review of published studies, COVID-19 patients may be more likely to experience acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, coagulation defects, and acute stroke and are likely to have poorer outcomes as a result. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, more data about potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease are required.","Larson, Anthony S; Savastano, Luis; Kadirvel, Ramanathan; Kallmes, David F; Hassan, Ameer E; Brinjikji, Waleed",J Am Heart Assoc,473,14

While intact TBK1 signaling is required for successful anti-viral signaling, dysregulated TBK1 signaling has been linked to a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, including cancer. Several lines of evidence support a role for TBK1 in cancer pathogenesis, but the specific roles and regulation of TBK1 remain incompletely understood. A key challenge is the diversity of cellular processes that are regulated by TBK1, including inflammation, cell cycle, autophagy, energy homeostasis, and cell death. Nevertheless, evidence from pre-clinical cancer models suggest that targeting TBK1 may be an effective strategy for anti-cancer therapy in specific settings. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the roles and regulation of TBK1 with a focus on cancer pathogenesis and drug targeting of TBK1 as an anti-cancer strategy. Relevant literature was derived from a PubMed search encompassing studies from 1999 to 2020. EXPERT OPINION: TBK1 is emerging as a potential target for anti-cancer therapy. Inhibition of TBK1 alone may be insufficient to restrain the growth of most cancers, hence combination strategies will likely be necessary. Improved understanding of tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic TBK1 signaling will inform novel therapeutic strategies.","Revach, Or-Yam; Liu, Shuming; Jenkins, Russell W",,473,1

This tenuous shortage may touch various aspects but in the first place it will affect isolation and cohorting. In addition, this shortage will not only apply to acutely ill children with viral respiratory tract infections but all children with need for hospital care, either chronically ill or e.g. being premature babies or newborns. Therefore, approaches are required which on the one hand are based on pragmatic grounds but on the other hand fulfill the basics of hygiene and infection control. The recommendations proposed in this statement are intended to give assistance to hospitals for the management of testing, isolation and cohorting of pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV­2 infections. The most important factor navigating the essential measures is the cumulative incidence of newly diagnosed infections per 100,000 over the last 7 days, which is given by the RKI or the local public health authorities. In the situation of low (<25/100,000) or medium (25-50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and hospital admission can be performed under standard hygiene precautions and the children will be cohorted according to their clinical presentation until the results of SARS-CoV­2 test (or RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] or influenza test) are available. In the situation of high (>50/100,000) incidence the respective diagnostic measures and the admission have to be performed under SARS-CoV­2 precautions as specified by the RKI, and the children have to be isolated until the results of SARS-CoV­2 test are available. The assessment of the incidence figures and the respective measures may be adapted by the local public health authorities on an individual basis. In case of shortfalls in admission capacities, the requirement of acute emergency care may necessitate that isolation and cohorting in the hospital will have to be performed temporarily in a less restrictive way than recommended here for standard.","Berner, Reinhard; Huebner, Johannes; Huppertz, Hans-Iko; Simon, Arne; Walger, Peter",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,473,6

A sequential simulation session was implemented to improve and assess FiY1 preparedness towards approaching deteriorating patients. Method: 12 FiY1 doctors participated in the session containing three sequential major stations: complex new admission, ward-based management, and acute deterioration. Participants interpreted investigations, performed examinations, created management plans, and escalated using a pager. Results: There was a significant improvement in preparedness for giving treatment (median(IQR): pre-simulation 3(3-4) vs. post-simulation 4(4-4.75);p=0.04) and paperwork (2(2-3.75) vs. 4(3.25-4.75);p=0.03). Following four weeks of FiY1 participants demonstrated significant improvement in preparedness for giving treatment (median(IQR): presimulation 3(3-4) vs. post-FiY1 4.5(4-5);p=0.01), communication and teamworking (4(3.25-4.75) vs. 5(5-5.75);p=0.01), and paperwork (2(2-3.75) vs. 5(5-5);p=0.01). The FiY1 programme improved integration within teams and facilitated training whilst medical school placements left participants feeling apprehensive and unprepared to practice. Conclusions: This session provided an engaging method of increasing preparedness towards common challenges new physicians face. This study suggests future senior medical student apprenticeships should give the same investment, opportunities, and responsibilities as that of the FiY1 programme.","Ashcroft, J.; Havers, N.; Seebacher-Tomas, A.; Plesci, E.; Goh, S.; Hudson, V.",British Journal of Surgery,473,16

Moreover, trained dedicated COVID-19 teams consisting of physicians were coming from different specialties (intensivists or pneumologists and infectiologists), while respiratory therapists and nurses have been recruited to work on and on without rest. However, due to still limited and evolving knowledge of COVID-19, there are few recommendations concerning the need in respiratory rehabilitation and physiotherapy interventions.

In April 2020 at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, one of the three oncologic hubs in Lombardy where the Health Regional Authorities referred all the cancer patients of the region, we implemented a prospective longitudinal study aimed at monitoring the serological response to SARS-Cov-2 in HCP. One hundred and ten HCP answered a questionnaire and were screened by nasopharyngeal swabs as well as for IgM/IgG levels; seropositive HCPs were further screened every 40-45 days using SARS-CoV-2-specific serology. We identified a fraction of HCP with long-term anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, though negative for viral RNA, and thus probably able to safely approach fragile cancer patients. Monitoring asymptomatic HCP might provide useful information to organize the healthcare service in a Cancer Center, while waiting for the effectiveness of the active immunization by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which will provide protection from infection.","Ciniselli, Chiara Maura; Micali, Arianna; De Cecco, Loris; Notti, Paola; Sinno, Valentina; Luison, Elena; Melani, Cecilia C; Daidone, Maria Grazia; Apolone, Giovanni; Verderio, Paolo; Figini, Mariangela",,473,16

SUMMARY: A retrospective chart review of 8 adults on warfarin admitted to Michigan Medicine with COVID-19 infection was conducted and reported as a case series. Outcomes of interest were difference in average daily dose of warfarin prior to admission (PTA) and while inpatient (IP), warfarin sensitivity, time in therapeutic range (TTR), confirmed or suspected thromboembolic event, any major or clinically significant bleeding episodes, and in-hospital mortality. IP average daily warfarin doses were lower when compared to PTA average daily doses [1.3 mg (1.3) vs. 6.2 mg (4.1)]. The mean percentage decrease in dose was 68.8% (23) and the mean absolute dose difference was 4.8 mg (4.3). Mean IP percentage tests in range was 30.8% (24.6) and mean IP warfarin sensitivity was 4.2 (3.8), both of which differed from PTA TTR and warfarin sensitivity for those with data available (n = 3, n = 6, respectively). One patient was treated for suspected acute pulmonary embolism while on warfarin and one patient experienced clinically relevant bleeding. In-hospital mortality was zero, mean length of stay (LOS) was 17 days (14.4), and mean intensive care unit (ICU) LOS for the 3 patients requiring ICU level care was 14.3 days (4.5). CONCLUSION: Decreased warfarin dose requirements were evident in this group of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. These findings suggest lower doses of warfarin may be needed to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation while inpatient.","Irwin, Madison N; Adie, Sarah; Sandison, Katherine; Alsomairy, Sarah A; Brancaccio, Adamo",J Pharm Pract,473,14

Also, we aim to evaluate breastfeeding rates predischarge and postdischarge. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from symptomatic and high-risk women in the delivery room. Mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were separated from the newborns. Newborns were screened within 48 hours of delivery, and anti-infectious guidelines were imparted to the mothers before discharge. Rescreening took place &#8805;14 days postdischarge. Data regarding SARS-CoV-2-positive household members and breastfeeding were obtained by follow-up phone calls. RESULTS: A total of 73 newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were born in Israel during the â¼3-month period under study. Overall, 55 participated in this study. All neonates tested negative for the virus postdelivery. A total 74.5% of the neonates were fed unpasteurized expressed breast milk during the postpartum separation until discharge. Eighty-nine percent of the neonates were discharged from the hospital after their mothers were instructed in anti-infection measures. In 40% of the households, there were additional SARS-CoV-2-positive residents. A total of 85% of the newborns were breastfed postdischarge. Results for all 60% of the newborns retested for SARS-CoV-2 postdischarge were negative. CONCLUSIONS: No viral infection was identified in neonates born to and separated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers at birth and subsequently fed unpasteurized breast milk. All infants breastfed at home remained SARS-CoV-2 negative. These findings may provide insights regarding the redundancy of postpartum mother-newborn separation in SARS-CoV-2-positive women and, assuming precautions are adhered to, support the safety of breast milk.","Shlomai, Noa Ofek; Kasirer, Yair; Strauss, Tzipora; Smolkin, Tatiana; Marom, Ronella; Shinwell, Eric S; Simmonds, Arye; Golan, Agneta; Morag, Iris; Waisman, Dan; Felszer-Fisch, Clari; Wolf, Dana G; Eventov-Friedman, Smadar",Pediatrics,473,16

It began to spread at the end of 2019 and has now spread across the world. Until October 2020, It has infected around 37 million people and claimed about 1 million lives. We propose a deep learning model that can help radiologists and clinicians use chest X-rays to diagnose COVID-19 cases and show the diagnostic features of pneumonia. Methods: The approach in this study is: 1) we propose a data enhancement method to increase the diversity of the data set, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. 2) Our deep convolution neural network model DPN-SE adds a self-attention mechanism to the DPN network. The addition of a self-attention mechanism has greatly improved the performance of the network. 3) Use the Lime interpretable library to mark the feature regions on the X-ray medical image that helps doctors more quickly diagnose COVID-19 in people. Results: Under the same network model, the data with and without data enhancement is put into the model for training respectively. At last, comparing two experimental results: among the 10 network models with different structures, 7 network models have improved their effects after using data enhancement, with an average improvement of 1% in recognition accuracy. We propose that the accuracy and recall rates of the DPN-SE network are 93% and 98% of cases (COVID vs. pneumonia bacteria vs. viral pneumonia vs. normal). Compared with the original DPN, the respective accuracy is improved by 2%. Conclusion: The data augmentation method we used has achieved effective results on a small amount of data set, showing that a reasonable data augmentation method can improve the recognition accuracy without changing the sample size and model structure. Overall, the proposed method and model can effectively become a very useful tool for clinical radiologists.","Cheng, Bo; Xue, Ruhui; Yang, Hang; Zhu, Laili; Xiang, Wei",,473,8

211979,211979,211979,Surgical training during the COVID-19 pandemic,18.506718,5.015248,2021,"BACKGROUNDRecent studies have reported T cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in unexposed donors, possibly due to crossrecognition by T cells specific for common cold coronaviruses (CCCs). True T cell crossreactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2.METHODSWe used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC crossreactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system.RESULTSMemory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm, for what we believe is the first time, the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes crossrecognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of crossreactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that preexisting CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these crossreactive T cell responses affect clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.FUNDINGNIH funding (U54CA260492, P30CA006973, P41EB028239, R01AI153349, R01AI145435-A1, R21AI149760, and U19A1088791) was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

To mitigate this issue, the scientific community is working on the development of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) systems that learn from a training set containing only normal (i.e., healthy) images, where abnormal samples (i.e., unhealthy) are detected and segmented based on how much they deviate from the learned distribution of normal samples. One significant challenge faced by UAD methods is how to learn effective low-dimensional image representations that are sensitive enough to detect and segment abnormal lesions of varying size, appearance and shape. To address this challenge, we propose a novel self-supervised UAD pre-training algorithm, named Multi-centred Strong Augmentation via Contrastive Learning (MSACL). MSACL learns representations by separating several types of strong and weak augmentations of normal image samples, where the weak augmentations represent normal images and strong augmentations denote synthetic abnormal images. To produce such strong augmentations, we introduce MedMix, a novel data augmentation strategy that creates new training images with realistic looking lesions (i.e., anomalies) in normal images. The pre-trained representations from MSACL are generic and can be used to improve the efficacy of different types of off-the-shelf state-of-the-art (SOTA) UAD models. Comprehensive experimental results show that the use of MSACL largely improves these SOTA UAD models on four medical imaging datasets from diverse organs, namely colonoscopy, fundus screening and covid-19 chest-ray datasets.","Tian, Yu; Liu, Fengbei; Pang, Guansong; Chen, Yuanhong; Liu, Yuyuan; Verjans, Johan W.; Singh, Rajvinder; Carneiro, Gustavo",,473,25

One Campus Virus Infection and Control Simulation model (CVICS) of the novel coronavirus is proposed in this paper, fully considering the characteristics of repeated contact and strong mobility of crowd in the closed environment. Specifically, we build an agent-based infection model, introduce the mean field theory to calculate the probability of virus transmission, and micro-simulate the daily prevalence of infection among individuals. The experimental results show that the proposed model in this paper efficiently simulate how the virus spread in the dense crowd in frequent contact under closed environment. Furthermore, preventive and control measures such as self-protection, crowd decentralization and isolation during the epidemic can effectively delay the arrival of infection peak and reduce the prevalence, and finally lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission after the students return to school.","Lv, Pei; Zhang, Quan; Xu, Boya; Feng, Ran; Li, Chaochao; Xue, Junxiao; Zhou, Bing; Xu, Mingliang",,473,1

Death education is a type of intervention that helps people manage their fear of death by offering them effective strategies to deal with loss and anxiety. To that end, a path of death education has been carried out with University students of psychology. The main purpose of the research is to understand how students who participated in the death education course perceive the lockdown experience in light of course teachings. The research was carried out at a University in northern Italy in an area severely affected by COVID-19, during the first year of the pandemic. The group of participants included 38 students, 30 women and 8 men, with an average age of 25.45 years (SD = 7). At the end of the course, the students could respond on an optional basis to the request to comment on the training experience according to what they experienced during the pandemic. A thematic analysis was subsequently carried out on the texts, which made it possible to identify the most relevant thematic areas for the students. The qualitative analyses permitted recognition of three main forms of discovery: the removal of death in contemporary culture; the importance of community, ritual and funeral, and spirituality; and the significance of death education for future health professionals. The texts have highlighted how the removal of these issues exposes people to the risk of being unable to handle extremely painful events such as those related to dying.

Data of 15 consecutive patients were sequentially recorded from intensive care unit admission. Lymphocyte subsets and total monocyte and subsets counts were monitored as well as the expression of HLA-DR. For 5 patients, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was assessed against Spike and Nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Non-specific inflammation markers were increased in all patients. Median monocyte HLA-DR expression was below the 8,000 AB/C threshold defining acquired immunodepression. A ""V"" trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11 and 14 after symptoms' onset. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes. Polyfunctional SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 T-cells were present and functional, whereas virus-specific CD8 T-cells were less frequent and not efficient. We report a temporal variation of both innate and adaptive immunity in severe COVID-19 patients, helpful in guiding therapeutic decisions (e.g. anti-inflammatory vs. immunostimulatory ones). We describe a defect in virus-specific CD8 T-cells, a potential biomarker of clinical severity. These combined data also provide helpful knowledge for vaccine design.

Ten Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analyses identified were conducted in high (n=4), intermediate (n=2), and low (n=4) TB burden countries. EXPERT OPINION: The paucity of model-based health economic analyses on BDQ-containing regimens for DR-TB indicated that further pharmacoeconomic research of BDQ-based regimens, on the aspects of duration of BDQ treatment, types of DR-TB indicated, and settings of regions and health-systems, is highly warranted to inform global cost-effective use of BDQ-based regimens for DR-TB treatment.","Fekadu, Ginenus; Yao, Jiaqi; You, Joyce H S",Expert rev. pharmacoecon. outcomes res,473,22

This was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited exposure to patients for clinical teaching. METHODS: We conducted a proof-of-concept study at a London teaching hospital using mixed reality (MR) technology (HoloLens2&#8482;) to deliver a remote access teaching ward round. RESULTS: Students unanimously agreed that use of this technology was enjoyable and provided teaching that was otherwise inaccessible. The majority of participants gave positive feedback on the MR (holographic) content used (n = 8 out of 11) and agreed they could interact with and have their questions answered by the clinician leading the ward round (n = 9). Quantitative and free text feedback from students, patients and faculty members demonstrated that this is a feasible, acceptable and effective method for delivery of clinical education. DISCUSSION: We have used this technology in a novel way to transform the delivery of medical education and enable consistent access to high-quality teaching. This can now be integrated across the curriculum and will include remote access to specialist clinics and surgery. A library of bespoke MR educational resources will be created for future generations of medical students and doctors to use on an international scale.","Bala, Laksha; Kinross, James; Martin, Guy; Koizia, Louis J; Kooner, Angad S; Shimshon, Gideon J; Hurkxkens, Thomas J; Pratt, Philip J; Sam, Amir H",Clin. teach,473,33

Methods The patients we included had some therapeutic endoscopic procedures delayed due to pandemic. Results First patient - 56 years old, had oesophagus resection in June 2018, followed by gastroplasty and adjuvantchemotherapy. In August 2018 had a follow up where anastomose stricture was observed. Afterwards patient received 8 dilatationprocedures during year's time and in October 2019 self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) was inserted to reduce thefrequency of dilatation procedures. On time evacuation 6 weeks after the insertion and a follow up in January 2020.Unfortunately, the stricture has formed repeatedly and patient has to continue dilatation procedures every month. Patient agrees for another SEMS just before the pandemic in March, afterwards several moths delay due to COVID-19associated procedures, so next follow up only in August 2020 where we see an embedded stent. Evacuation wasunsuccessful and patient had to have an operation during which the oesophagus was replaced with small intestine. A weeklater after surgery patient's state worsens because of necrosis of autotransplant followed by patient's death. Our second patient - 69 years old, had oesophagus reresection in January 2020. Postoperative period with complications asthe patient has a leakage of newly formed anastomosis and we decided to insert SEMS for further support. Afterwards 4 months delay due to the pandemic, as patient comes for follow up only in July 2020. In this case we were ableto remove the embedded stent with stent-in-stent technique and instruct the patient to continue follow up every month fordilatation procedures.

There is need of protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from SARS-CoV-2 while treating patients. We designed, developed and analysed effectiveness of a physical barrier called bronchoscopy safety box (BSB) to prevent COVID-19 transmission to HCFs while doing bronchoscopy procedures and endotracheal intubation. METHOD: Two prototypes of Bronchoscopy safety box (BSBs) viz., prototype 1 (figure 2a) and prototype 2 (figure 2b), was developed (made up of acrylic and PVC sheets). BSB include the additional presence of the bronchoscopy aperture and an assistant aperture. In prototype 1, each aperture has a PVC valve which opens and closes with entry and exit of the hands while instead of PVC valves, there are gloves attached at the Doctor's and assistant aperture in Prototype 2 which minimizes risk of aerosol coming out of these apertures. There is negative suction port which is important in reducing the aerosol content inside the BSB. The patient end has PVC sheet curtains to accommodate shoulders/chest of patients that further minimises aerosol transmission. The box is easy to disinfect with 70% alcohol or bleach. Bronchoscopy procedures (foreign body removal, balloon bronchoplasty, endobronchial ultrasound, bronchial washings) and intubation was done with BSBs in 20 patients.RESULT: We were able to manoeuvre the bronchoscope and navigate up to the right lower lobe bronchus and left lower bronchus without any difficulty. The intubation procedure was performed comfortably with the BSB. 10 bronchoscopy procedures were performed with the Prototype 1 while 6 bronchoscopy procedures and 4 intubation procedures were performed with Prototype 2. CONCLUSION: BSB is a reusable, multi-purpose aerosol safety barrier which can be utilized for bronchoscopy procedures and intubation to help protect HCWs against COVID-19. .","Arbat, S.

These airway teams were implemented in various hospitals around the world to respond to the acute increase of critical ill patients requiring ventilatory support. We created a financial model to estimate the costs for staffing and maintaining a dedicated COVID-19 airway response team based on the experience at an urban academic hospital in the Northeastern United States between March and June of 2020. METHODS: The institutional review board at Brigham and Women's Hospital approved this protocol and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The average reimbursement for 125 COVID-19 airway consultations was measured. Our team estimated the costs of consumable items for each airway based on previously published recommendations for equipment and personal protective equipment. A sensitivity analyses was performed for variable numbers of monthly airway consults and different staffing patterns based on a literature review of available COVID-19 airway team structures. RESULTS: Based on the average reimbursements and estimates of the consumable costs, each airway procedure represented a net loss of $34 to the institution. The overall estimated cost of staffing a dedicated airway team was between $109,472 and $204,575 per month. CONCLUSIONS: Development and implementation of a dedicated COVID-19 airway response teams represents a significant institutional expense. Institutions should establish necessary cost sharing, consider volume and team structure, and identify reimbursement opportunities that mitigate the necessary expense associated with airway response programs.","Stone, Alexander B; Grant, Michael C; Dasani, Serena S; Nascimben, Luigino",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,473,30

We aimed to construct a model integrating information from radiomics and deep learning (DL) features to discriminate critical cases from severe cases of COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) images. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 217 patients from three centers in China, including 82 patients with severe disease and 135 with critical disease. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 174) and a test cohort (n = 43). We extracted 102 3-dimensional radiomic features from automatically segmented lung volume and selected the significant features. We also developed a 3-dimensional DL network based on center-cropped slices. Using multivariable logistic regression, we then created a merged model based on significant radiomic features and DL scores. We employed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's performance. We then conducted cross validation, stratified analysis, survival analysis, and decision curve analysis to evaluate the robustness of our method. RESULTS: The merged model can distinguish critical patients with AUCs of 0.909 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.859-0.952) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.753-0.968) in the training and test cohorts, respectively. Stratified analysis indicated that our model was not affected by sex, age, or chronic disease. Moreover, the results of the merged model showed a strong correlation with patient outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: A model combining radiomic and DL features of the lung could help distinguish critical cases from severe cases of COVID-19.","Li, Cong; Dong, Di; Li, Liang; Gong, Wei; Li, Xiaohu; Bai, Yan; Wang, Meiyun; Hu, Zhenhua; Zha, Yunfei; Tian, Jie",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,473,24

The results indicate that the effect of COVID-19 on Bangladeshi food security during FY 2019/20 was mixed, as the indicators of food availability improved by 5%, and decreased by 17% for food stability, relative to what they would have been otherwise. Policy simulation results indicate that a higher import tariff improves self-sufficiency status, but undermines rice availability and accessibility by bending the market toward a restrictive trade regime. Results also indicate that unlike stock enhancement policy, closing the existing yield gap improves rice availability, accessibility, and moderates the depressing effect of a future event with repercussions similar to COVID-19, although the yield policy appears more speculative and could be too costly.

One of the consequences of exposure to disasters/pandemics is an increase in alcohol use. The current study aimed to examine what predisposing (distal) and pandemic-related (proximal) factors were associated with increased drinking in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: On 1 April 2020, 5158 Australians completed a survey from the COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project, a nationwide study aimed at tracking key mental health concerns. Using logistic regression, distal (demographics and previous drinking behaviors) and proximal (employment, lifestyle factors, and mood) factors were assessed for their association with increased drinking since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Distal factors, including heavier drinking pre-pandemic, middle age, and average or higher income, and proximal factors, including job loss, eating more, changes to sleep as well as stress and depression, were all associated with increased drinking in the COVID-19 pandemic environment. Female sex and self-reported history of mental illness became nonsignificant after proximal measures were added to the model. Living alone, exercise, anxiety, and status as an essential or health-care worker were not associated with increased drinking. CONCLUSION: These results provide guidance as to who might be targeted to receive support based on predisposing demographic factors and pre-pandemic drinking behavior. Second, they indicate what behaviors/factors accompany increased alcohol use and provide targets for psychosocial and psychoeducational supports to address these proximal factors.","Neill, Erica; Meyer, Denny; Toh, Wei Lin; van Rheenen, Tamsyn Elizabeth; Phillipou, Andrea; Tan, Eric Josiah; Rossell, Susan Lee",Psychiatry clin. neurosci,473,20

ASGARD can repurpose single drugs for each cell cluster and for multiple cell clusters at individual patient levels;it can also predict personalized drug combinations to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. We tested ASGARD on three independent datasets, including advanced metastatic breast cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On single-drug therapy, ASGARD shows significantly better average accuracy (AUC=0.95) compared to two other single-cell pipelines (AUC 0.69 and 0.57) and two other bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods (AUC 0.80 and 0.75). The top-ranked drugs, such as fulvestrant and neratinib for breast cancer, tretinoin and vorinostat for leukemia, and chloroquine and enalapril for severe COVID19, are either approved by FDA or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. In conclusion, ASGARD is a promising pipeline guided by single-cell RNA-seq data, for repurposing personalized drugs and drug combinations.

Social media, a near real-time information source, has been widely used in disasters for forming timely situational awareness. Yet, using social media to sense electricity infrastructure conditions has not been explored. This study aims to address the research gap through mining public topics from social media. To achieve this purpose, we proposed a systematic and customized approach wherein (1) electricity-related social media data is extracted by the classifier developed based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT); and (2) public topics are modeled with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams to incorporate the formulaic expressions of infrastructure conditions in social media. Electricity infrastructures in Florida impacted by Hurricane Irma are studied for illustration and demonstration. Results show that the proposed approach is capable of sensing the temporal evolutions and geographic differences of electricity infrastructure conditions.","Chen, Yudi; Umana, Angel; Yang, Chaowei; Wenying, JI",,473,1

One means to help protect research data from use in civil or criminal matters in the United States is a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). Until recently, investigators applied for a CoC when conducting research that was sensitive, stigmatizing or where the disclosure of private information could possibly result in civil or criminal liability. However, effective October 1, 2017, CoCs are automatically issued for much research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). While automatic issuance reduces administrative burden, it also poses some surprising unanticipated challenges for research in general and pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) in particular, which are key elements of learning health systems. Methods: We reviewed the new policy on CoCs to identify and analyze issues related to it that are potentially problematic for PCTs. Results: We identified three relevant issues: (1) whether the EHR may be populated with research data that may be sensitive or stigmatizing without explicit consent from subjects; (2) incomplete protections for sensitive data in the EHR; and (3) requirements for notifying subjects about the CoC provisions. Conclusion: Formal guidance from the NIH is needed to address the application of CoCs to the setting of PCTs. In the meantime, it is essential for researchers designing and conducting PCTs, as well as health care systems in which this research is conducted, to be aware of the nuances inherent in CoCs so they can best adhere to their legal obligations regarding them. In the absence of guidance, special attention should be paid to pragmatic research that populates the electronic health record with research data as well as research conducted without explicit consent. Given the large amount of pragmatic research precipitated by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, which has been accompanied by major efforts to share data, the need for such guidance is especially urgent.","Sugarman, Jeremy; Carrithers, Judith",Learning Health Syst.,473,16

We reviewed the current COVID-19 protocols of the 15 largest hospitals in Andalusia. Antiviral treatment, empirical antibacterial agents, adjunctive therapies, anticoagulant treatment, supportive care, hospital organization, and discharge recommendations were analyzed. All protocols included were the latest updates as of July 2020. Hydroxychloroquine in monotherapy was the most frequent antiviral drug recommended for mild respiratory illness with clinical risk factors (33.3%). Combined hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin or lopinavir/ritonavir was found in 40% of protocols. The recommended treatment for patients with mild and moderate pneumonias was different antiviral combinations including hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (93.3%) or hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir/ritonavir (79.9%). Different combinations of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (46.7%) and triple therapy with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir (40%) were the most recommended treatments for patients with severe pneumonia. There were five corticosteroid regimens, which used dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, or prednisone, with different doses and treatment durations. Anakinra was included in seven protocols with six different regimens. All protocols included prophylactic heparin and therapeutic doses for thromboembolism. Higher prophylactic doses of heparin for high-risk patients and therapeutic doses for patients in critical condition were included in 53.3% and 33.3% of protocols, respectively. This study showed that COVID-19 protocols varied widely in several aspects (antiviral treatment, corticosteroids, anakinra, and anticoagulation for high risk of thrombosis or critical situation).

In this study, a novel concept of near-infrared (NIR) light activation of conjugated polymer dots (Pdots) at thermosensitive hydrogel nanostructures is introduced for multimodal imaging-guided synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy. Interestingly, owing to the attractive photothermal conversion efficiency of Pdots, the Pdots@hydrogel as theranostic agents is able to undergo a controllable softening or melting state under the irradiation of NIR laser, resulting in light-triggered drug release in a controlled way and concurrently hydrogel degradation. Besides, the novel Pdots@hydrogel nanoplatform can serve as the theranostic agent for enhanced trimodal photoacoustic (PA)/computed tomography (CT)/fluorescence (FL) imaging-guided synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy of tumors. More importantly, the constructed intelligent nanocomposite Pdots@hydrogel exhibits excellent biodegradability, strong NIR absorption, bright PA/CT/FL signals, and superior tumor ablation effect.

To fight the novel coronavirus, one of the best-known ways is to block enzymes essential for virus replication.

SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry and transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2) for spike protein priming. Thus in order to speed up the discovery of potential drugs, we develop DockCoV2, a drug database for SARS-CoV-2. DockCoV2 focuses on predicting the binding affinity of FDA-approved and Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) drugs with the seven proteins mentioned above. This database contains a total of 3,109 drugs. DockCoV2 is easy to use and search against, is well cross-linked to external databases, and provides the state-of-the-art prediction results in one site. Users can download their drug-protein docking data of interest and examine additional drug-related information on DockCoV2.

This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on all lifestyle medicine pillars, namely diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, social support and use of risky substances. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of adults who resided in Cyprus during the Spring 2020 lockdown. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire comprised of six validated tools regarding the following lifestyle behaviours before and during lockdown: adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity, stress and social support levels, sleep pattern and use of risky substances such as smoking and alcohol. Paired before and during lockdown comparisons for each lifestyle pillar were undertaken using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Bowker symmetry Test where response was numerical (non-parametric data) and categorical respectively. Furthermore, stratified analyses for sociodemographic characteristics were performed. RESULTS: Out of 745 participants, 74% were female and median age was 39 years. Overall participants reported significantly higher perceived stress score (22 v 25, p < 0.01), lower social support score (71 v 68, p < 0.001), and worse sleep quality score (4 v 5, p < 0.01) during lockdown. Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence was moderate and increased significantly only in those practicing religious fasting (score of 6 v 7, p < 0.01). Total minutes spent sitting increased (120 v 180, p < 0.01) although overall physical activity score did not significantly change. Smoking intensity increased during lockdown whilst frequency of alcohol consumption decreased (ptrend = 0.03 and < 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Various lifestyle factors were adversely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in Cyprus. Evidence from this study supports development of holistic lifestyle interventions during and following the pandemic to reduce short and long-term NCD risks by building on lifestyle behaviour strengths and addressing longstanding and emerging gaps and needs.","Kolokotroni, Ourania; Mosquera, Maria C; Quattrocchi, Annalisa; Heraclides, Alexandros; Demetriou, Christiana; Philippou, Elena",BMC Public Health,473,16

This study was conducted to investigate the differences in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 between the epicenter and peripheral areas of pandemic and thereby generate information that would be potentially helpful in formulating clinical practice recommendations to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Sichuan & Wuhan Collaboration Research Group for COVID-19 established two retrospective cohorts that separately reflect the epicenter and peripheral area during the early pandemic. The epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients in the two groups were compared. Multivariate regression analyses were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with regard to the outcomes. RESULTS: The Wuhan (epicenter) cohort included 710 randomly selected patients, and the peripheral (Sichuan) cohort included 474 consecutive patients. A higher proportion of patients from the periphery had upper airway symptoms, whereas a lower proportion of patients in the epicenter had lower airway symptoms and comorbidities. Patients in the epicenter had a higher risk of death (aOR=7.64), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (aOR=1.66), delayed time from illness onset to hospital and ICU admission (aOR=6.29 and aOR=8.03, respectively), and prolonged duration of viral shedding (aOR=1.64). CONCLUSIONS: The worse outcomes in the epicenter could be explained by the prolonged time from illness onset to hospital and ICU admission. This could potentially have been associated with elevated systemic inflammation secondary to organ dysfunction and prolonged duration of virus shedding independent of age and comorbidities. Thus, early supportive care could achieve better clinical outcomes.","Wang, Gang; Luo, Feng Ming; Liu, Dan; Liu, Jia Sheng; Wang, Ye; Chen, Hong; Tian, Pan Wen; Fan, Tao; Tang, Li; Yu, He; Wang, Lan; Feng, Mei; Ni, Zhong; Wang, Bo; Song, Zhi Fang; Wu, Xiao Ling; Wang, Hong Jun; Tong, Xiang; Xue, Miao; Lei, Xian Ying; Long, Bo; Jia, Chao; Xiao, Jun; Shang, Juan; Xiong, Nian; Luo, Jian Fei; Liang, Zong An; Li, Wei Min",BMC Infect Dis,473,12

We propose here a viewpoint of significant interest about the sudden need to develop remote home-based CR programs both in clinical research and in clinical care routine. This last decade, the literature on remote home-based CR programs has been increasing, but to date only clinical research experiences have been implemented. Benefits are numerous and the relevance of this approach has obviously increased with the actual health emergency. The COVID-19 crisis, the important prevalence of smartphones, and high-speed Internet during confinement should be viewed as an opportunity to promote a major shift in CR programs with the use of telemedicine to advance the health of a larger number of individuals with cardiac disease.","Besnier, Florent; Gayda, Mathieu; Nigam, Anil; Juneau, Martin; Bherer, Louis",Arch Phys Med Rehabil,473,32

This review summarizes recent evidence on the relationship between psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders and COVID-19, highlighting acute and long-term risks, pharmacotherapy interactions and implications regarding appropriate and timely evidence-based treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence points to a complex relationship between psychiatric and substance use disorders and COVID-19. A range of risk factors associated with psychiatric and substance use disorders increases the risk of exposure to, and complications arising from, the COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 infection has been indicated as having acute and potential long-term impacts on both psychiatric and substance use disorders. Social disruption associated with restrictions imposed to curb transmission has also been identified as a risk factor for new onset of disorders and recurrence and exacerbation of existing conditions. SUMMARY: Early recognition and intervention are key to preventing chronic disability associated with psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and their co-occurrence. It is critical that those most in need of services do not fall through the cracks of our healthcare systems. The pandemic has fast tracked the opportunity for widespread implementation of digital health interventions but ensuring these are accessible and available to all, including our most vulnerable, will be a critical task for our future health and social ecosystems.","Marel, Christina; Mills, Katherine L; Teesson, Maree",Curr Opin Psychiatry,473,20

The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on MS are not known. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on new and pre-existing symptoms of MS. METHODS: The COVID-19 and MS study is an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort study conducted as part of the United Kingdom MS Register. People with MS and COVID-19 were invited by email to complete a questionnaire about their MS symptoms during the infection. An MS exacerbation was defined as developing new MS symptoms and/or worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-seven percent (230/404) of participants had an MS exacerbation during their infection; 82 developed new MS symptoms, 207 experienced worsened pre-existing MS symptoms, and 59 reported both. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) reduced the likelihood of developing new MS symptoms during the infection (OR 0.556, 95%CI 0.316-0.978).

We conducted a case-control study within the UK Biobank cohort linked to the COVID-19 tests results available from 16 March 2020 until 23 August 2020. The main exposure variable was socioeconomic status, assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. Among 18,917 participants with an incident malignancy in the UK Biobank cohort, 89 tested positive for COVID-19. The overall COVID-19 incidence was 4.7 cases per 1000 incident cancer patients (95%CI 3.8-5.8). Compared with the least deprived cancer patients, those living in the most deprived areas had an almost three times higher risk of testing positive (RR 2.6, 95%CI 1.1-5.8). Other independent risk factors were ethnic minority background, obesity, unemployment, smoking, and being diagnosed with a haematological cancer for less than five years. A consistent pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 among incident cancer patients in the UK highlights the need to prioritise the cancer patients living in the most deprived areas in vaccination planning. This socio-demographic profiling of vulnerable cancer patients at increased risk of infection can inform prevention strategies and policy improvements for the coming pandemic waves.","Lee, Shing Fung; Niksic, Maja; Rachet, Bernard; Sanchez, Maria-Jose; Luque-Fernandez, Miguel Angel",,473,29

In higher education, where students’ autonomy is even more desired, the design of online learning experiences that focus on reflective thinking has always been a principal focus, due to the relation between reflection and self-regulated learning. This study focuses on a technically non-demanding way of combining two existing online tools and appropriating their use towards a two-fold pedagogical goal: (a) students’ creation and sharing of reflective narrations on their experience of a practice-oriented social science methods introductory course using JustPaste.it;and (b) their subsequent meta-reflection on these narrations using the course’s online Discussion Forum. The study highlights two main factors in the success of this combination, namely the importance of structuring guidelines and prompts for both reflection and meta-reflection to take place, and taking into account the age (average 17 years old) and multiple national backgrounds of the participants.

Here, for the first time, we develop a near real-time air pollutant database known as Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, tapdata.org) that combines information from multiple data sources, including ground measurements, satellite retrievals, dynamically updated emission inventories, operational chemical transport model simulations and other ancillary data. Daily full-coverage PM2.5 data at a spatial resolution of 10 km is our first near real-time product. The TAP PM2.5 is estimated based on a two-stage machine learning model coupled with the synthetic minority oversampling technique and a tree-based gap-filling method. Our model has an averaged out-of-bag cross-validation R2 of 0.83 for different years, which is comparable to those of other studies, but improves its performance at high pollution levels and fills the gaps in missing AOD on daily scale. The full coverage and near real-time updates of the daily PM2.5 data allow us to track the day-to-day variations in PM2.5 concentrations over China in a timely manner. The long-term records of PM2.5 data since 2000 will also support policy assessments and health impact studies. The TAP PM2.5 data are publicly available through our website for sharing with the research and policy communities.","Geng, Guannan; Xiao, Qingyang; Liu, Shigan; Liu, Xiaodong; Cheng, Jing; Zheng, Yixuan; Tong, Dan; Zheng, Bo; Peng, Yiran; Huang, Xiaomeng; He, Kebin; Zhang, Qiang",,473,16

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can uncover single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and corresponding evolution patterns. The Global Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2/hCoV-19 Sequences (GESS, https://wan-bioinfo.shinyapps.io/GESS/) is a resource to provide comprehensive analysis results based on tens of thousands of high-coverage and high-quality SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes. The database allows user to browse, search and download SNVs at any individual or multiple SARS-CoV-2 genomic positions, or within a chosen genomic region or protein, or in certain country/area of interest. GESS reveals geographical distributions of SNVs around the world and across the states of USA, while exhibiting time-dependent patterns for SNV occurrences which reflect development of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For each month, the top 100 SNVs that were firstly identified world-widely can be retrieved. GESS also explores SNVs occurring simultaneously with specific SNVs of user's interests. Furthermore, the database can be of great help to calibrate mutation rates and identify conserved genome regions. Taken together, GESS is a powerful resource and tool to monitor SARS-CoV-2 migration and evolution according to featured genomic variations.

COVID-19 is a current pandemic that influences the mental health of various populations, especially pregnant women. Despite the importance of sexual health, the specific nature of its relationship to overall mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is not clearly defined. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between sexual function and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional study was carried out among 437 pregnant women using the sociodemographic and obstetrics characteristics questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Inventory, Stress, Depression, and Anxiety Scales. Random sampling was employed to select pregnant women who had a medical record in Health Centers of Tabriz city, Iran. The questionnaires were sent to the participants' cell phones via WhatsApp or text messages, including links of questionnaires and the participants completed these questionnaires. Spearman correlation test was used to determine the relationship between sexual function and stress, anxiety, and depression. Generalized linear modeling was used to estimate each of the independent variables (sociodemographic characteristics, stress, anxiety, and depression) on the dependent variable (sexual function). RESULTS: The mean (Standard Deviation) sexual functioning (total) score was 20.0 (8.50) from the available range of 2 to 36. The mean (SD) of depression, stress, and anxiety scale was 4.81 (5.22), 5.13 (4.37), and 7.86 (4.50) (possible score ranging from 0 to 21), respectively. Based on Spearman's correlation test, there was a significant reverse correlation between the total sexual function score and stress, anxiety, and depression, indicating that all three variables negatively impacted sexual functioning. Variables such as mild stress, spouse type of job, sufficient household income, living with parents, higher marital satisfaction, and higher gestational age had a significant, positive impact on sexual function and could predict 35.8% of the variance model. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual functioning was significantly impacted by stress, anxiety, and depression - all of which are heightened during a pandemic. This topic warrants further study, and the general public should be educated on the protective influence of safe sex/intimacy on overall mental health.","Effati-Daryani, Fatemeh; Jahanfar, Shayesteh; Mohammadi, Azam; Zarei, Somayeh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,473,24

To achieve this, the development and production of reliable and cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 antigens is critical. We report the bacterial production of the peptide S-RBDN318-V510, which contains the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (region of 193 amino acid residues from asparagine-318 to valine-510) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We purified this peptide using a straightforward approach involving bacterial lysis, his-tag-mediated affinity chromatography, and imidazole-assisted refolding. The antigen performances of S-RBDN318-V510 and a commercial full-length spike protein were compared in ELISAs. In direct ELISAs, where the antigen was directly bound to the ELISA surface, both antigens discriminated sera from non-exposed and exposed individuals. However, the discriminating resolution was better in ELISAs that used the full-spike antigen than the S-RBDN318-V510. Attachment of the antigens to the ELISA surface using a layer of anti-histidine antibodies gave equivalent resolution for both S-RBDN318-V510 and the full-length spike protein. Results demonstrate that ELISA-functional SARS-CoV-2 antigens can be produced in bacterial cultures, and that S-RBDN318-V510 may represent a cost-effective alternative to the use of structurally more complex antigens in serological COVID-19 testing.","Márquez-Ipiña, Alan Roberto; González-González, Everardo; Rodríguez-Sánchez, Iram Pablo; Lara-Mayorga, Itzel Montserrat; Mejía-Manzano, Luis Alberto; Sánchez-Salazar, Mónica Gabriela; González-Valdez, José Guillermo; Ortiz-López, Rocio; Rojas-Martínez, Augusto; Trujillo-de Santiago, Grissel; Alvarez, Mario Moisés",Diagnostics (Basel),473,24

The challenges experienced by Italian GPs remained unrevealed. This study aimed at exploring Italian GPs' care experiences and practices associated with critical incidents during the first wave of the pandemic. A qualitative study design involving the critical incident technique through an online survey was applied. Sociodemographic data and open-ended responses were collected. While participants' characteristics were analyzed through descriptive statistics, qualitative data were thematically analyzed employing the framework method. 149 GPs responded to the survey and 99 participants completed the survey (dropout rate = 33%). Eight themes emerged indicating factors related to the organization of the healthcare system and factors related to the clinical management of patients, that were perceived as impacting on the GPs' care provision. The analysis revealed difficulties in communicating with other local services. This, together with the lack of coordination among services, was reported as a major challenge. Primary care was perceived as having been undervalued and criticalities in the organization of GP courses, led in a bureaucratic fashion, posed at risk some trainees to be infected. The digital technologies adopted for remote patient consultations were seen as useful tools for daily practice helping the GPs to stay emotionally connected with their patients. Besides, the improvement in the GP-patient relationship in terms of solidarity between patients and doctors and compliance to rules, had a positive impact. Moreover, many respondents addressed the importance of professional collaboration and teamwork, in terms of both support in practical issues (to find PPE, diagnostics and guidelines) and emotional support. At the same time, the lack of resources (e.g., PPE, swabs) and of specific guidelines and protocols impacted on the care provision. Our findings suggest that GPs in Italy are at risk of being left behind within the epidemic management. Communication and coordination among services are essential and should be substantially improved, and primary care research should be initiated to collect the context-specific evidence necessary to enhance the system's preparedness to public health emergencies and the quality of primary care services.","Kurotschka, Peter Konstantin; Serafini, Alice; Demontis, Michela; Serafini, Arianna; Mereu, Alessandro; Moro, Maria Francesca; Carta, Mauro Giovanni; Ghirotto, Luca",Front Public Health,473,16

Since then more than eight million confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported around the globe. The current gold standard for etiologic diagnosis is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of respiratory-tract specimens, but the test has a high false-negative rate owing to both nasopharyngeal swab sampling error and viral burden. Hence diagnostic imaging has emerged as a fundamental component of current management of COVID-19. Currently, high-resolution computed tomography is the main imaging tool for primary diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity in patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging has become a safe bedside imaging alternative that does not expose the patient to radiation and minimizes the risk of contamination. Although the number of studies to date is limited, LUS findings have demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, comparable with those of chest computed tomography scans. In this note we review the current state of the art of LUS in evaluating pulmonary changes induced by COVID-19.

Dentists are exposed to the enormous risk of COVID-19 infection during this epidemic. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of dentists toward the COVID-19 epidemic in Lebanon. METHODS: We conducted an online survey using the snowball-sampling technique. Information on socio-demographic data, knowledge, practice, and additional information required concerning COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS: Our results showed that the majority of the Lebanese dentists had good knowledge (91.3%), and nearly half of the respondents had a good practice (58.7%) regarding COVID-19. The most common information source was the World Health Organization (73.7%). Multiple linear regression showed that specialist dentists who completed training on COVID-19 with a high level of knowledge had better practice. CONCLUSIONS: Lebanese dentists revealed good knowledge regarding COVID-19. However, dentists had limited comprehension of the extra precautionary measures that protect the dental staff and patients from this virus. Our findings have important implications for the development of strategies suitable for improving the level of practice among dentists and enhance prevention programs.","Nasser, Zeina; Fares, Youssef; Daoud, Rama; Abou-Abbas, Linda",BMC Oral Health,473,29

This paper reviews published data which reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tears and conjunctival scrappings of some COVID-19 patients by real-time-polymerase chain reaction assay, although the detection rate is low compared to samples from respiratory sites. Nevertheless, the ocular complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection are uncommon. The evidence partly supports the eye as a portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2 to infect respiratory cells or viral shedding from respiratory cells via the nasolacrimal duct unto the ocular surface. The possibility of ocular secretions as source for SARS-CoV-2 to spread externally has substantial public health implications.","Ocansey, Stephen; Abu, Emmanuel Kwasi; Abraham, Carl Halladay; Owusu-Ansah, Andrew; Boadi-Kusi, Samuel Bert; Ilechie, Alex Azuka; Acheampong, Desmond Omane",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,473,24

Common impairments after stroke create unique challenges when providing rehabilitation via telehealth, particularly when it involves activities undertaken in weight-bearing or standing positions, including walking training. Our scoping review maps the evidence regarding safety, efficacy and feasibility of remotely supervised telehealth interventions involving activities undertaken in weight-bearing or standing positions for people after stroke. METHODS: Searches of relevant databases for primary research studies were conducted using keywords relating to exercise and telehealth. Studies of stroke survivors undertaking interventions involving activities in weightbearing or standing positions, supervised in real-time via telehealth were included. Two reviewers independently appraised all studies. Data were charted by one reviewer, checked by another and results synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Seven studies (two randomized trials, one mixed-methods and four pre-post studies) were included, involving 179 participants. Some studies included stroke survivors with cognitive impairment and two (29%) studies only included participants who walked independently. Adherence (reported in three studies) and satisfaction (reported in four studies) was good, and no serious adverse events (data from four studies) related to interventions were reported. Strategies to overcome technological barriers were used to optimize intervention safety and feasibility, along with physiological monitoring, caregiver assistance and in-person exercise prescription. However, there is limited high quality evidence of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: We identified strategies used in research to date which can support current practice. However, urgent research is needed to ensure that stroke survivors are receiving evidence-based, effective services. IMPACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid shift to telerehabilitation services for people with stroke, but there is little evidence to guide best practice. Our review provides practical guidance and strategies to overcome barriers, and optimize safety and adherence for telehealth interventions involving activities in weightbearing or standing positions.","Ramage, Emily; Fini, Natalie; Lynch, Elizabeth; Marsden, Dianne L; Patterson, Amanda J; Said, Catherine M; English, Coralie",Phys. ther,473,24

As projective curves flattened, administrators and surgeons sought to develop strategies to safely resume non-emergent surgery. This article reviews challenges and solutions specific to a children's hospital related to the resumption of elective pediatric surgeries. We present our tiered reentry approach for pediatric surgery as well as report early data for surgical volume and tracking COVID-19 cases during reentry. METHODS: The experience of shutdown, protocol development, and early reentry of elective pediatric surgery are reported from Levine's Children's Hospital (LCH), a free-leaning children's hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. Data reported were obtained from de-identified hospital databases. RESULTS: Pediatric surgery experienced a dramatic decrease in case volumes at LCH during the shutdown, variable by specialty. A tiered and balanced reentry strategy was implemented with steady resumption of elective surgery following strict pre-procedural screening and testing. Early outcomes showed a steady thorough fluctuating increase in elective case volumes without evidence of a surgery-associated positive spread through periprocedural tracking. CONCLUSION: Reentry of non-emergent pediatric surgical care requires unique considerations including the impact of COVID-19 on children, each children hospital structure and resources, and preventing undue delay in intervention for age- and disease-specific pediatric conditions. A carefully balanced strategy has been critical for safe reentry following the anticipated surge. Ongoing tracking of resource utilization, operative volumes, and testing results will remain vital as community spread continues to fluctuate across the country.","Pickens, Ryan C; Kao, Angela M; Williams, Mark A; Herman, Andrew C; Kneisl, Jeffrey S",Am Surg,473,16

Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant's social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life. Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full-text articles. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD -0.34, 95% CI -3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD -2.40, 95% CI -7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months' follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months' follow-up (MD -0.83, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short-Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that measure different aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no difference between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI -5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD -7.66, 95% CI -24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD -7.18, 95% CI -16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI -8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD -3.25, 95% CI -15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD -3.60, 95% CI -9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02) and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI -2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review there is currently very uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of video call interventions to reduce loneliness in older adults. The review did not include any studies that reported evidence of the effectiveness of video call interventions to address social isolation in older adults. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain. Future research in this area needs to use more rigorous methods and more diverse and representative participants. Specifically, future studies should target older adults, who are demonstrably lonely or socially isolated, or both, across a range of settings to determine whether video call interventions are effective in a population in which these outcomes are in need of improvement.","Noone, Chris; McSharry, Jenny; Smalle, Mike; Burns, Annette; Dwan, Kerry; Devane, Declan; Morrissey, Eimear C",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,473,15

Scientists disagree how to interpret this observation because the relationship between COVID-19 and climatic conditions may be confounded by many factors. We regress the logarithm of confirmed COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants in a country against the country's distance from the equator, controlling for key confounding factors: air travel, vehicle concentration, urbanization, COVID-19 testing intensity, cell phone usage, income, old-age dependency ratio, and health expenditure. A one-degree increase in absolute latitude is associated with a 4.3% increase in cases per million inhabitants as of January 9, 2021 (p value < 0.001). Our results imply that a country, which is located 1000 km closer to the equator, could expect 33% fewer cases per million inhabitants. Since the change in Earth's angle towards the sun between equinox and solstice is about 23.5°, one could expect a difference in cases per million inhabitants of 64% between two hypothetical countries whose climates differ to a similar extent as two adjacent seasons. According to our results, countries are expected to see a decline in new COVID-19 cases during summer and a resurgence during winter. However, our results do not imply that the disease will vanish during summer or will not affect countries close to the equator. Rather, the higher temperatures and more intense UV radiation in summer are likely to support public health measures to contain SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Simiao; Prettner, Klaus; Kuhn, Michael; Geldsetzer, Pascal; Wang, Chen; Bärnighausen, Till; Bloom, David E",Sci Rep,473,12

Funding for other treatments, in particular new treatments, may become more constrained than previously expected. Therefore, a robust health technology assessment (HTA) system is vital. Many clinical trials carried out during the pandemic may have been temporarily halted, while others may have had to change their protocols. Even trials that continue as normal may experience external changes as other aspects of the healthcare service may not be available to the patients in the trial, or the patients themselves may contract COVID-19. Consequently, many limitations are likely to arise in the provision of robust HTAs, which could have profound consequences on the availability of new treatments. Therefore, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics Review Group wishes to discuss these issues and make recommendations for applicants submitting to HTA agencies, in ample time for these HTAs to be prepared and assessed. We discuss how the pandemic may affect the estimation of the treatment effect, costs, life-years, utilities, discontinuation rates, and methods of evidence synthesis and extrapolation. In particular, we note that trials conducted during the pandemic will be subject to a higher degree of uncertainty than before. It is vital that applicants clearly identify any parameters that may be affected by the pandemic. These parameters will require considerably more scenario and sensitivity analyses to account for this increase in uncertainty.","Leahy, Joy; Hickey, Conor; McConnell, David; Cassidy, Owen; Trela-Larsen, Lea; Barry, Michael; Tilson, Lesley; McCullagh, Laura",Value Health,473,29

DESIGN: Retrospective manual medical record review. SETTING: NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition. RESULTS: Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis. Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days. As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.","Argenziano, Michael G; Bruce, Samuel L; Slater, Cody L; Tiao, Jonathan R; Baldwin, Matthew R; Barr, R Graham; Chang, Bernard P; Chau, Katherine H; Choi, Justin J; Gavin, Nicholas; Goyal, Parag; Mills, Angela M; Patel, Ashmi A; Romney, Marie-Laure S; Safford, Monika M; Schluger, Neil W; Sengupta, Soumitra; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Zucker, Jason E; Asadourian, Paul A; Bell, Fletcher M; Boyd, Rebekah; Cohen, Matthew F; Colquhoun, MacAlistair I; Colville, Lucy A; de Jonge, Joseph H; Dershowitz, Lyle B; Dey, Shirin A; Eiseman, Katherine A; Girvin, Zachary P; Goni, Daniella T; Harb, Amro A; Herzik, Nicholas; Householder, Sarah; Karaaslan, Lara E; Lee, Heather; Lieberman, Evan; Ling, Andrew; Lu, Ree; Shou, Arthur Y; Sisti, Alexander C; Snow, Zachary E; Sperring, Colin P; Xiong, Yuqing; Zhou, Henry W; Natarajan, Karthik; Hripcsak, George; Chen, Ruijun",BMJ,473,26

A possible involvement of pathogenetically relevant autoantibodies has been discussed. Recently neutralizing autoantibodies against anti-inflammatory receptor antagonists progranulin (PGRN) and IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1-Ra) were discovered in adult patients with critical COVID-19. Plasma of an index case with severe PIMS/MIS-C was analyzed for autoantibodies against IL-1-Ra and PGRN. The study was extended by a case series of 12 additional patients. In addition to ELISA for of antibodies, IL-1-Ra plasma levels were determined and IL-1-Ra was analyzed by Western-blot and isoelectric focusing. Functional activity of the autoantibodies was examined in vitro with IL-1{beta} reporter assays. Antibodies against IL-1-Ra could be detected in 10 of 13 (76.9%) patients with PIMS/MIS-C, but not in controls. In contrast to critical COVID-19 in adults, no IL-1-Ra antibodies of the IgM class were detected in PIMS/MIS-C. IL-1-Ra-antibodies exclusively belonged to IgG1. No antibodies directed against PGRN were detected. Western blots and ELISA showed a concomitant reduction of free IL-1-Ra plasma levels in the presence of IL-1-Ra-antibodies. The antibodies inhibited IL-1-Ra function in IL-1{beta} reporter cell assays. Notably, an additional, hyperphosphorylated, transiently occurring atypical isoform of IL-1-Ra was observed in all IL-1-Ra autoantibody-positive patients. To conclude, IL-1-Ra autoantibodies were observed in high frequency in children with PIMS/MIS-C. They may represent a diagnostic and pathophysiologically relevant marker for PIMS/MIS-C. Their generation is likely to be triggered by an atypical, hyperphosphorylated isoform of IL-1-Ra.","Pfeifer, Jochen; Thurner, Bernhard; Kessel, Christoph; Fadle, Natalie; Regitz, Evi; Hoffmann, Marie-Christin; Kos, Igor; Preuss, Klaus-Dieter; Fischer, Yvan; Roemer, Klaus; Lohse, Stefan; Heyne, Kristina; Detemple, Marie-Claire; Fedlmeier, Michael; Juenger, Hendrik; Sauer, Harald; Meyer, Sascha; Rohrer, Tilman; Wittkowski, Helmut; Masjosthusmann, Katja; Becker, Soeren Leif; Smola, Sigrun; Bewarder, Moritz; Boehm, Michael; Anton, Jordi; Pino-Ramirez, Rosa Maria; Abdul-Khaliq, Hashim; Foell, Dirk; Thurner, Lorenz",,473,26

Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing peripheral blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines between individuals at risk of psychosis and controls. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that the levels of these markers may be different in high-risk converters versus non-converters. Two independent reviewers searched electronic databases until Dec 16th, 2020. After reviewing publication records, 16 studies (548 high-risk individuals and 559 controls) were included. Random-effects meta-analyses with Hedges' g as the effect size estimate were performed. Individuals at clinical risk of psychosis had significantly higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to controls (g = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.06-0.60, p = 0.018). Heterogeneity was not significant in this subgroup analysis. Changes in the levels of IL-6 in subjects at familial risk of psychosis were not significant (g = 0.04, 95%CI: -0.24 to 0.31, p = 0.798). The use of antidepressants was associated with significantly higher levels of IL-6 in high-risk individuals (Beta = 1.56, 95%CI: 0.60-2.53, p = 0.001). No significant differences in the levels of immune-inflammatory markers were found between high-risk converters and non-converters. Our findings suggest that individuals at clinical risk of psychosis show subclinical inflammation in terms of elevated IL-6 levels. This phenomenon might be related to the use of antidepressants. The present meta-analysis does not support the usefulness of single immune-inflammatory markers in predicting transition to psychosis.","Misiak, Blazej; Bartoli, Francesco; Carrà, Giuseppe; Stanczykiewicz, Bartlomiej; Gladka, Anna; Frydecka, Dorota; Samochowiec, Jerzy; Jarosz, Konrad; Hadrys, Tomasz; Miller, Brian J",Psychoneuroendocrinology,473,18

However, the two main professional societies for human reproduction (ESHRE and ASRM) appear divergent on their clinical utility and whether they should be adopted. In this opinion paper, we review the currently available tests and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed clinical care pathways. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 testing but test results are largely influenced by viral load, sample site, specimen collection method, and specimen shipment technique, such that a negative result in a symptomatic patient cannot be relied upon. Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies exhibit a temporal increase in sensitivity and specificity after symptom onset irrespective of the assay used, with sensitivity estimates ranging from 0 to 50% with the first 3 days of symptoms, to 83 to 88% at 10 days, increasing to almost 100% at &#8805; 14 days. These inherent constraints in diagnostics would suggest that at present there is inadequate evidence to utilize SARS-CoV-2 testing to stratify fertility patients and reliably inform clinical decision-making.

This study aims to quantify the effect of these delays on visual acuity (VA) outcomes and optical coherence tomography (OCT) features for patients receiving treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), retinal vein occlusions (RVO) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and correlate to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists guidelines (RCOphth). METHODS: A retrospective data analysis of an electronic medical record was performed on a random sample of eyes receiving anti-VEGF injections for nAMD, RVO or DMO. Data collected included age, sex, reason for injection, number of weeks delay if > 8 weeks from that planned, VA at baseline and follow-up and the OCT features, if delayed. For those eyes not delayed, a visual acuity at 20 weeks was recorded to provide a control group. RESULTS: A sample of 981 eyes (858 patients) were analysed. There was a delay in review of 8 weeks or more in 39.6% of patients of which 30.4% had since returned for review (28.4% nAMD, 37.6% RVO and 30.0% DMO). There was no demographic difference identified between the delayed and non-delayed patients; however, the delayed group was significantly more likely to have better vision in their non-treated eye (p = 0.0003). A statistically significant difference was found in the change in VA between the delayed and the not-delayed group for eyes with nAMD (p = 0.001) but not for RVO or DMO. For the delayed group, mean CMT increased by 33 and 100 µm, respectively, for nAMD and RVO and decreased by 7.8 µm for DMO. The VA of 89.7% of DMO eyes returned to baseline, compared to 74.6% and 76.9% of nAMD and RVO eyes. CONCLUSION: The RCOphth guidance to prioritise intravitreal injections for nAMD over DMO appears appropriate in this cohort but not for RVO. Eyes with nAMD experienced the greatest loss of vision with treatment delay, and nAMD and RVO eyes were less likely to return to baseline on restarting treatment.","Stone, Lydia G; Grinton, Michael E; Talks, James S",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,473,16

Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS: The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of two DEX-sparing regimens with 3-day DEX, focusing on delayed nausea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomized, phase III study was designed to demonstrate noninferiority of two DEX-sparing regimens: ondansetron + DEX on day 1, metoclopramide on days 2-3 (MCP arm), and palonosetron + DEX on day 1 (PAL arm) to ondansetron on day 1 + DEX on days 1-3 (DEX arm) in chemotherapy-naïve patients receiving MEC. Primary efficacy endpoint was total control (TC; no emetic episodes, no use of rescue medication, no nausea) in the delayed phase. Noninferiority was defined as a lower 95% CI greater than the noninferiority margin set at -20%. Secondary endpoints included no vomiting, no rescue medication, no (significant) nausea, impact of CINV on quality of life, antiemetics-associated side-effects. RESULTS: Treatment arms were comparable for 189 patients analyzed: predominantly male (55.7%); median age 65.0 years; colorectal cancer (85.7%); oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (81.5%). MCP demonstrated noninferiority to DEX for delayed TC [MCP 56.1% versus DEX 50.0%, 95% CI (-11.3%, 23.5%)]. PAL also demonstrated noninferiority to DEX [PAL 55.6% versus DEX 50.0%, 95% CI (-12.0%, 23.2%)]. There were no statistically significant differences for all secondary endpoints between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: This study showed that DEX-sparing regimens are noninferior to multiple-day DEX in terms of delayed TC rate in patients undergoing MEC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (number: NCT02135510). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the delayed phase (24-120 hr post-chemotherapy) remains one of the most troublesome adverse effects associated with cancer treatment. In particular, delayed nausea is often poorly controlled. The role of dexamethasone (DEX) in the prevention of delayed nausea after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) is controversial. Our study is the first to include nausea assessment as a part of the primary study outcome to better gauge the effectiveness of CINV control and patients' experience.

Current evidence suggests that, while individuals with diabetes and obesity are no more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those without, the risk of hospitalisation if someone has diabetes or obesity and then contracts COVID-19 is three times higher - and 4.5 times higher if they have diabetes and obesity. We assembled a panel of experts from South and East Europe, the Middle East, and Africa to discuss the challenges to management of diabetes and obesity during and post the COVID-19 pandemic. The experience and learnings of this panel cover a heterogeneous patient population, wide range of clinical settings, healthcare organisations, disease management strategies, and social factors. We discuss the importance of timely and effective disease management via telemedicine, providing reassurance and guidance for patients unable or unwilling to visit healthcare settings at this time. We address the use of novel therapies and their role in managing diabetes and obesity during the pandemic, as well as the importance of controlling hypoglycaemia and preventing cardiovascular complications, particularly in vulnerable people.

The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among humans and more continues to be detected over time as to how it spreads. The effect that this crisis will have on the mental health of the population, both in the short and long term, is unknown. In the acute phase, fears of possible exposure to infection, loss of employment, and financial strain are likely to increase psychological distress in the wider population. In the long run, grief and trauma are likely to appear as financial and social impacts become ingrained, the risk of depression and suicide may increase. Lack of hugs, handshakes, free movement and isolation have made it impossible for people to socialize and behave normally with each other. Anxiety, fear, insecurity and lack of self-confidence are some of the main problems that people faced during quarantine and that they may face after the release of the measures. The purpose of this paper is to prove how much the Pandemic and the situation with COVID-19 have affected the mental health of the population in the city of Prizren and Gjakova. Quantitative study method was used for the realization of this work. This paper is based on the data extracted from the questionnaire completed together with the citizens of the municipalities of Prizren and Gjakova. For the realization of this scientific research are involved 200 citizens. Age groups, gender, economic status, level of education and place of residence were analyzed.

We aimed to provide a comprehensive/updated evaluation of the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on COVID-19-related clinical outcomes, including exploration of interclass differences between ACEIs and ARBs, using a systematic review/meta-analysis approach conducted in Medline (OVID), Embase, Scopus, Cochrane library, and medRxiv from inception to 22 May 2020. English studies that evaluated the effect of ACEIs/ARBs among patients with COVID-19 were included. Studies' quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were analyzed using the random-effects modeling stratified by exposure (ACEIs/ARBs, ACEIs, and ARBs). Heterogeneiity was assessed using I2 statistic. Several subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the impact of potential confounders. Overall, 27 studies were eligible. The pooled analyses showed nonsignificant associations between ACEIs/ARBs and death (OR:0.97, 95%CI:0.75,1.27), ICU admission (OR:1.09;95%CI:0.65,1.81), death/ICU admission (OR:0.67; 95%CI:0.52,0.86), risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:1.01; 95%CI:0.93,1.10), severe infection (OR:0.78; 95%CI:0.53,1.15), and hospitalization (OR:1.15; 95%CI:0.81,1.65). However, the subgroup analyses indicated significant association between ACEIs/ARBs and hospitalization among USA studies (OR:1.59; 95%CI:1.03,2.44), peer-reviewed (OR:1.93, 95%CI:1.38,2.71), good quality and studies which reported adjusted measure of effect (OR:1.30, 95%CI:1.10,1.50). Significant differences were found between ACEIs and ARBs with the latter being significantly associated with lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection (OR:0.24; 95%CI: 0.17,0.34). In conclusion, high-quality evidence exists for the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on some COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

We sought to identify relationships between postoperative complication type and readmission timing and cost in pancreaticoduodenectomy patients. METHODS: Hospital cost data from date of discharge to postoperative day 90 were merged with 2008-2018 NSQIP data. Early readmission was within 30 days of surgery, and late readmission was 30 to 90 days from surgery. Regression analyses for readmission controlled for patient comorbidities, complications, and surgeon. RESULTS: Of 230 patients included, 58 (25%) were readmitted. The mean early and late readmission costs were $18,365 ± $20,262 and $24,965 ± $34,435, respectively. Early readmission was associated with index stay deep vein thrombosis (p < 0.01), delayed gastric emptying (p < 0.01), and grade B pancreatic fistula (p < 0.01). High-cost early readmission had long hospital stays or invasive procedures. Common late readmission diagnoses were grade B pancreatic fistula requiring drainage (n = 5, 14%), failure to thrive (n = 4, 14%), and bowel obstruction requiring operation (n = 3, 11%). High-cost late readmissions were associated with chronic complications requiring reoperation. CONCLUSION: Early and late readmissions following pancreaticoduodenectomy differ in both etiology and cost. Early readmission and cost are driven by common complications requiring percutaneous intervention while late readmission and cost are driven by chronic complications and reoperation. Late readmissions are frequent and a significant source of resource utilization. Negotiations of bundled care payment plans should account for significant late readmission resource utilization.","Acher, Alexandra W; Barrett, James R; Schwartz, Patrick B; Stahl, Chris; Aiken, Taylor; Ronnekleiv-Kelly, Sean; Minter, Rebecca M; Leverson, Glen; Weber, Sharon; Abbott, Daniel E",J. gastrointest. surg,473,16

The major clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the disease causes a potent systemic hyperin-flammatory response, i.e., a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is associated with thrombotic complications. The complexity of the disease requires appropriate intensive treatment. One of promising treatment is statin administration, these being 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies indicate that statin therapy is associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19, which may be caused by direct and indirect mechanisms. According to literature data, statins can limit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication by inhibiting the main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The cytokine storm can be ameliorated by lowering serum IL-6 levels; this can be achieved by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and modulating macrophage activity. Statins can also reduce the complications of COVID-19, such as thrombosis and pulmonary fibrosis, by reducing serum PAI-1 levels, attenuating TGF-ß and VEGF in lung tissue, and improving endothelial function. Despite these benefits, statin therapy may have side effects that should be considered, such as elevated creatinine kinase (CK), liver enzyme and serum glucose levels, which are already elevated in severe COVID-19 infection. The present study analyzes the latest findings regarding the benefits and limitations of statin therapy in patients with COVID-19.","Pawlos, Agnieszka; Niedzielski, Mateusz; Gorzelak-Pabis, Paulina; Broncel, Marlena; Wozniak, Ewelina",Int. j. mol. sci.

No studies to date have evaluated the effects on weight stigma and health of obesity-focused COVID-19 media and public health messages. Individuals with a history of experiencing weight bias may be more vulnerable to binge eating and psychological distress during the pandemic.

Somryst&#8482;, the first PDT authorized by FDA for treating chronic insomnia, delivers cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) via a mobile application. CBT-I is the guideline-recommended, first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, but availability of CBT-I therapists is limited. Somryst addresses this need by providing asynchronous access to CBT-I treatment. As a contactless therapeutic medium, Somryst is also an ideal option when face-to-face therapy is not available or recommended for safety reasons (e.g., because of possible exposure to pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus). Areas covered: PDTs are the first class of software-based medical devices FDA-cleared and available via mobile applications. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action and technical features of Somryst, and describes safety and effectiveness data from the randomized trials on which FDA clearance was based. Expert opinion: Somryst demonstrates robust clinical efficacy with a favorable benefit-to-risk profile for treating adults with chronic insomnia. FDA clearance was based on data from 2 clinical trials of the first-generation web-based CBT-I platform Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi). Somryst, and PDTs in general, are promising devices to address the need for greater accessibility to effective therapies.","Morin, Charles M",Expert rev. med. devices,473,24

One of the underlying assumptions is that irradiation of 0.5 to 1.5 Gy is effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. We aimed to reanalyze all available experimental radiobiologic data to assess evidence for such amelioration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: With standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature review, we reanalyzed 13 radiobiologic animal data sets published in 1937 to 1973 in which animals (guinea pigs/dogs/cats/rats/mice) received radiation before or after bacterial or viral inoculation, and assessing various health endpoints (mortality/pneumonia morbidity). In most data sets absorbed doses did not exceed 7 Gy. RESULTS: For 6 studies evaluating postinoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to low dose radiation therapy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with one study showing a significant increase (P < .001) and another showing a significant decrease (P < .001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. Among the remaining 4 studies, mortality risk was nonsignificantly increased in 2 studies and nonsignificantly decreased in 2 others (P > .05). For preinoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with 6 (of 8) data sets showing a significant increase (P < .01) in mortality risk associated with radiation exposure and the other 2 showing a significant decrease (P < .05) in mortality or pneumonitis morbidity risk. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not provide support for reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with postinfection radiation exposure. For preinfection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction of effect is difficult to interpret. One must be cautious about adducing evidence from such published reports of old animal data sets.","Little, Mark P; Zhang, Wei; van Dusen, Roy; Hamada, Nobuyuki",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,473,1

An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management. OBJECTIVES: Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta2-agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta2-agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta2-agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.","Craig, Simon S; Dalziel, Stuart R; Powell, Colin Ve; Graudins, Andis; Babl, Franz E; Lunny, Carole",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,473,16

On March 10, the State of Michigan confirmed its first 2 cases of COVID-19, and the number of confirmed cases has reached 47,182 as of May 11, 2020, with 4555 deaths. SETTING: Currently, little is known if patients living with HIV (PLWH) are at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 or if their antiretrovirals are protective. This study presents epidemiologic and clinical features of COVID-19 infected PLWH in Detroit, Michigan. METHODS: This is a case series that included 14 PLWH with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were evaluated at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between March 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Fourteen PLWH were diagnosed with COVID-19. Twelve patients were men and 2 were women; 13 patients were virally suppressed. Eight patients were hospitalized, and 6 patients were told to self-quarantine at home after their diagnoses. Three patients who were admitted expired during their hospital stay. No patient required bilevel positive airway pressure or nebulizer use in the emergency department, and none developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, or a cytokine storm while on therapy for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Although the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 among PLWH cannot be fully ascertained by this report, it adds to the data that suggest that HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not at a greater risk of severe disease or death as compared to HIV-negative patients.","Gudipati, Smitha; Brar, Indira; Murray, Shannon; McKinnon, John E; Yared, Nicholas; Markowitz, Norman",,473,15

Due to the current demographic distribution in Bangladesh, young adults comprise almost one-third of the total population of the country. Therefore, their precautionary behavior is very important to ensure the success of preventive policies. This exploratory study examined the differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors among young adults, and estimated and compared the predictors of precautionary behavior adoption among young adults living in the capital city Dhaka and a nearby district, Tangail. Subject and methods: A total of 350 respondents from each district participated in the study. ANOVA and two-sample t-tests were utilized to detect differences in precautionary behavior across demographic groups of young adults, and quantile regression modeling was used to find the predictors of adopting precautionary behaviors and to compare these predictors between the two districts. Results: Individuals who had a postgraduate education and had good mental health tended to show better precautionary behaviors in Dhaka. Female respondents from Tangail who had no psychological distress took precautionary behaviors more often than their male counterparts. However, no significant differences in the adoption of precautionary behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among young adults were found between the two districts. Better self-control ability, higher education and good mental health emerged as factors that significantly shaped the precautionary behaviors of young adults in this study. Conclusion: Having better knowledge did not ensure better adoption of precautionary behaviors among the participants. In effect, the government's strong intervention to keep people maintaining social distance and a strict lockdown in severely affected areas are probable immediate solutions.","Imtiaz, Asif; Khan, Noor Muhammad; Hossain, Md Akram",Z Gesundh Wiss,473,16

How US hospitals responded to this crisis is unknown. RESEARCH QUESTION: What actions did US hospitals take to prepare for a potential surge in demand for critical care services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From September to November 2020, the chief nursing officers of a representative sample of US hospitals were surveyed regarding organizational actions taken to increase or maintain critical care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted proportions of hospitals for each potential action were calculated to create estimates across the entire population of US hospitals, accounting for both the sampling strategy and nonresponse. Also examined was whether the types of actions taken varied according to the cumulative regional incidence of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Responses were received from 169 of 540 surveyed US hospitals (response rate, 31.3%). Almost all hospitals canceled or postponed elective surgeries (96.7%) and nonsurgical procedures (94.8%). Few hospitals created new medical units in areas not typically dedicated to health care (12.9%), and almost none adopted triage protocols (5.6%) or protocols to connect multiple patients to a single ventilator (4.8%). Actions to increase or preserve ICU staff, including use of ICU telemedicine, were highly variable, without any single dominant strategy. Hospitals experiencing a higher incidence of COVID-19 did not consistently take different actions compared with hospitals facing lower incidence. INTERPRETATION: Responses of hospitals to the mass need for critical care services due to the COVID-19 pandemic were highly variable. Most hospitals canceled procedures to preserve ICU capacity and scaled up ICU capacity using existing clinical space and staffing.

Uncertainty around its effects and transmission in aerosol generating procedures (AGP's) has led to disagreement within maxillofacial surgeons into the safety of orthognathic surgery during the pandemic. We present a local case series of orthognathic surgery undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge no such similar study has been reported worldwide. Data was collected from the 1st June to 30th November 2020 for all patients undergoing orthognathic surgery by a single consultant. All procedures and inpatient stays were performed 'off site' at the local Spire Healthcare Group plc© facility. A strict preoperative two-week self-isolation period and negative COVID-19 testing was mandatory. All procedures were classified as AGP's and personal protective equipment (PPE) was worn in line with local guidelines. The primary outcome was 30-day COVID-19 infection among patients, with day 0 the date of surgery. Secondary outcome measures included duration of stay, return to theatre and complications. A total of 59 patients were identified. 42/59 had bimaxillary procedures and 17/59 single jaw. 9/17 had maxillary and 8/17 had mandibular procedures. A total of 3/59 had simultaneous genioplasty. Median duration of stay was one night (range 1-3). Immediate and late complications were seen in 3% (2/59) and 3% (2/59) respectively. Only 1% (1/59) returned to theatre. Zero patients tested positive in the 30-day postoperative period. No staff members tested positive for the duration of the study.

The outbreak made imperative the need for diagnostic and screening tests that could identify the current and past infection state of an individual. Occupational medicine is facing a very demanding challenge, as the pandemic set off the need to re-evaluate many aspects of workplace safety. A fundamental role has been played by tests used to diagnose COVID-19 and to isolate infected asymptomatic subjects, with a view to the viral evolution and the emerging variants. However, the need for the urgent set-up of new methods for assessing both new and past infections has resulted in a large number of methods, not always comparable with each other, in terms of laboratory techniques, viral antigens used for detection, and class of antibodies detected. These factors make it difficult to understand the serological test results and their possible application. In this paper, we reviewed the types of assays currently available, to address some key aspects that characterize each technique, and might have an impact on results interpretation.","Ferrari, Luca; Nigro, Simona; Bordini, Lorenzo; Carugno, Michele; Bollati, Valentina",Med Lav,473,21

Testing contacts may improve case ascertainment and reduce onward transmission. This study investigated the acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 testing among contacts of confirmed cases as an integral part of the contact-tracing process. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of case contacts was conducted in the UK. All contacts who completed a telephone call with the NHS Test and Trace Agile Lighthouse team were eligible for inclusion and were offered a molecular test. Consenting participants were sent a self-swab kit. RESULTS: Of the 1523 individuals contacted, 602 (39.5%) accepted the test offer. Of the 240 (39.9%) samples returned for testing, 16.3% tested polymerase chain reaction-positive for SARS-CoV-2.Most individuals who declined with a reason (638/905; 70.5%) reported they had already taken or booked a SARS-CoV-2 test, or were part of a testing programme. Matched laboratory records confirmed 73.1% of those who declined were tested by another route. CONCLUSIONS: Most case contacts were tested, either through arranging a test by themselves or by accepting the study offer. Results demonstrate high acceptability, with substantial test positivity, indicating that there is public health benefit in offering tests to contacts as a routine part of the contact-tracing process.","Marchant, E; Ready, D; Wimbury, G; Smithson, R; Charlett, A; Oliver, I",J. public health (Oxf),473,2

However, one-stop MDS is still unexplored because: (1) no dataset has so large-scale dialogues contains both multiple medical services and fine-grained medical labels (i.e., intents, slots, values); (2) no model has addressed a MDS based on multiple-service conversations in a unified framework. In this work, we first build a Multiple-domain Multiple-service medical dialogue (M^2-MedDialog)dataset, which contains 1,557 conversations between doctors and patients, covering 276 types of diseases, 2,468 medical entities, and 3 specialties of medical services. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only medical dialogue dataset that includes both multiple medical services and fine-grained medical labels. Then, we formulate a one-stop MDS as a sequence-to-sequence generation problem. We unify a MDS with causal language modeling and conditional causal language modeling, respectively. Specifically, we employ several pretrained models (i.e., BERT-WWM, BERT-MED, GPT2, and MT5) and their variants to get benchmarks on M^2-MedDialog dataset. We also propose pseudo labeling and natural perturbation methods to expand M2-MedDialog dataset and enhance the state-of-the-art pretrained models. We demonstrate the results achieved by the benchmarks so far through extensive experiments on M2-MedDialog. We release the dataset, the code, as well as the evaluation scripts to facilitate future research in this important research direction.","Yan, Guojun; Pei, Jiahuan; Ren, Pengjie; Chen, Zhumin; Ren, Zhaochun; Liang, Huasheng",,473,16

It is considered an important therapeutic target in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, since SARS-CoV-2 enters permissive cells via an ACE2-mediated mechanism. The present in silico study attempted to repurpose existing drugs for use as prospective viral-entry inhibitors targeting human ACE2. Initially, a clinically approved drug library of 7,173 ligands was screened against the receptor using molecular docking, followed by energy minimization and rescoring of docked ligands. Finally, potential binders were inspected to ensure molecules with different scaffolds were engaged in favorable contacts with both the metal cofactor and the critical residues lining the receptor's active site. The results of the calculations suggest that lividomycin, burixafor, quisinostat, fluprofylline, pemetrexed, spirofylline, edotecarin, and diniprofylline emerge as promising repositionable drug candidates for stabilizing the closed (substrate/inhibitor-bound) conformation of ACE2, thereby shifting the relative positions of the receptor's critical exterior residues recognized by SARS-CoV-2. This study is among the rare ones in the relevant scientific literature to search for potential ACE2 inhibitors. In practical terms, the drugs, unmodified as they are, may be introduced into the therapeutic armamentarium of the ongoing fight against COVID-19 now, or their scaffolds may serve as rich skeletons for designing novel ACE2 inhibitors in the near future.","Terali, Kerem; Baddal, Buket; Gülcan, Hayrettin Ozan",J Mol Graph Model,473,21

We propose to describe the thrombus viscoelastic properties to investigate the mechanisms of hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed in 24 consecutive patients admitted to a single intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia, and 10 had a second TEG before being discharged alive from the intensive care unit. RESULTS: Compared with a group of 20 healthy participants, patients with COVID-19 had significantly decreased values of reaction time, coagulation time, and lysis index and increased values of &#945; angle, maximum amplitude, clot strength, and coagulation index. Velocity curves were consistent with increased generation of thrombin. These values persisted in surviving patients despite their good clinical course. DISCUSSION: In patients with COVID-19, TEG demonstrates a complex and prolonged hypercoagulable state including fast initiation of coagulation and clot reinforcement, low fibrinolysis, high potential of thrombin generation, and high fibrinogen and platelet contribution. The antithrombotic strategy in patients with COVID-19 during intensive care hospitalisation and after discharge should be investigated in further studies.","Cordier, Pierre-Yves; Pierrou, Candice; Noel, Alexandre; Paris, Raphaël; Gaudray, Eliott; Martin, Edouard; Contargyris, Claire; Bélot-De Saint Léger, Frédérik; Lyochon, Arthur; Astier, Hélène; Desmots, Florian; Savini, Hélène; Surcouf, Corinne",Aust Crit Care,473,28

METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, prospective, and longitudinal study of 156 patients undergoing maintenance HD from 15 dialysis units conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assigned patients to receive dietary counseling through a phone call, according to their biochemical and nutritional parameters. Dry weight, intradialytic weight gain percentage (%IDWG), body mass index, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, calcium/phosphorus product, normalized protein catabolic rate, albumin, and hemoglobin were recorded at baseline and 1 month after nutrition counseling. RESULTS: The prevalence of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia decreased significantly after dietary advice. A statistically significant reduction in serum potassium and phosphorus levels was observed in patients receiving counseling for hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of hypophosphatemia. We also observed a significant decrease in %IDWG, although no statistically significant differences were detected in patients with high %IDWG. The data demonstrated statistically significant differences in potassium and phosphorus values when the person receiving the phone contact was the patient or the caregiver. The main statistically significant differences in hypophosphatemia %IDWG were only observed when contact was made directly with the patient. No differences were observed when the contact was made through nursing homes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that telehealth-delivered dietary interventions can improve the clinical and nutritional parameters of HD patients. Consequently, this strategy may be effective for promoting continuous nutritional monitoring in these patients, in particular when conducting a face-to-face option is not crucial.","Valente, Ana; Jesus, Joana; Breda, Joana; Dinis, Ana; Correia, André; Godinho, Joana; Oliveira, Telma; Garagarza, Cristina",J. renal nutr,473,23

METHOD: A questionnaire survey, drafted using Google Forms, was distributed among healthcare professionals working in the National Health Service (NHS) across the United Kingdom. The study was kept open for the first 2 weeks of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1007 responses were obtained with majority of the responses from England (n = 850, 84.40%). There were 670 (66.53%) responses from doctors and 204 (20.26%) from nurses. Most of the respondents (95.23%) had direct patient contact in day to day activity. Only one third of the respondents agreed that they felt supported at their trust and half of the respondents reported that adequate training was provided to the frontline staff. Two-thirds of the respondents were of the view that there was not enough Personal Protective Equipment available while 80% thought that this pandemic has improved their hand washing practice. Most of the respondents were in the favour of an earlier lockdown (90%) and testing all the NHS frontline staff (94%). CONCLUSION: Despite current efforts, it would seem this is not translating to a sense of security amongst the UK NHS workforce in terms of how they feel trained and protected. It is vital that healthcare professionals have adequate support and protection at their workplace and that these aspects be actively monitored.","Iqbal, Muhammad Rafaih; Chaudhuri, Arindam",Int J Surg,473,16

In current absence of a curative treatment and an effective, safe vaccine, there is a pressing need to focus on identifying and correcting deficits in immune function in order to reduce risk of severe progress of the disease and to lower the number of infections and fatalities. This paper evaluates the most recent literature on zinc status related to antiviral immunity and its possible role in COVID-19. It is concluded that zinc is a critical factor for antiviral immunity. There is ample evidence suggesting that zinc depletion, also prevalent in high-income nations, compromises immune functions. Notably, major risk groups for COVID-19, the elderly, men more than women, obese individuals and patients with diabetes are all at risk of zinc deficiency. Moreover, various widely used antihypertensive drugs and statin therapy have been reported to negatively influence zinc status. As zinc depletion impairs antiviral immunity, it is hypothesised to increase susceptibility for COVID-19. Therefore, dietary preventive measures and prompt implementation of zinc supplementation for risk groups should be considered. Large-scale studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of micronutrients and antiviral immunity, in particular drug-micronutrient immunity interaction.","Mossink, J P",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,473,4

The LaMB WG has interest in conceptual characteristics, transparency, comparability, and reusability of medical information, both in science and practice. METHODS: A set of methods were used (i) investigating the overall speed and dynamics of COVID-19 publications; (ii) characterizing the concepts of COVID-19 (text mining, visualizing a semantic map of related concepts); (iii) assessing (re)usability and combinability of data sets and paper collections (as textual data sets), and checking if information is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

AIM: To assess healthcare worker (HCW) perspectives on pre-warning rapid response calls (RRC) with 'Code-95' in announcements when attending to deteriorating or aggressive patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Design: prospective cross-sectional single-centre survey of HCW over a 3-week period. SETTING: tertiary public hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCW caring for deteriorating or aggressive patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the primary outcome was to assess HCW perspectives in attending Code-95 calls. Secondary outcomes were to identify any differences related to craft group, age, experience or presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 297 responses was analysed; 86.7% of HCW (n = 257) attending Code-95 calls reported anxiety. Medical staff reported greater anxiety in comparison to nursing staff (93.8% vs 78.5%; P = 0.002). Efferent team reported higher anxiety in contrast to afferent team (92.6% vs 58.8%; P = 0.021). There was no significant difference in perceived anxiety based on age (&#8804;40 vs >40 years of age), years of experience (&#8804;5 vs >5 years), comorbidities or mental illness; 54% reported concerns about adequacy of infection-control policies and personal protective equipment; 45% were worried about inadequate training for responding to Code-95 calls. CONCLUSIONS: Most surveyed HCW supported Code-95 announcements pre-warning them of potential COVID-19 exposure when attending a RRC. However, the majority of HCW reported anxiety when attending these calls. Medical and efferent team HCW perceived greater anxiety compared to nursing and afferent team HCW. The Code-95 system to pre-warn rapid response teams may be a useful addition to protecting HCW from infectious diseases, although broader implementation will require greater resourcing, training and support.","Subramaniam, Ashwin; Zuberav, Alexandr; Wengritzky, Robert; Bowden, Christopher; Tiruvoipati, Ravindranath; Wang, Wei Chun; Wadhwa, Vikas",Intern Med J,473,16

QC increased the antimicrobial activity against yeast exponentially with a pH-dependent increase in the cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD) structure. CAD-QC localized in the yeast membranes and induced glucose starvation by noncompetitively inhibiting glucose uptake as antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CPZ) did. An exponential increase in antimicrobial activity with pH-dependent CAD formation was also observed for CQ, indicating that the CAD structure is crucial for its pharmacological activity. A decrease in CAD structure with a slight decrease in pH from 7.4 greatly reduced their effects; namely, these drugs would inefficiently act on falciparum malaria and COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acidosis, resulting in resistance. The decrease in CAD structure at physiological pH was not observed for quinine, primaquine, or mefloquine. Therefore, restoring the normal blood pH or using pH-insensitive quinoline drugs might be effective for these infectious diseases with acidosis.","Kitagawa, Tomohisa; Matsumoto, Atsushi; Terashima, Ichiro; Uesono, Yukifumi",J Med Chem,473,16

BCG vaccine appears to be one of the candidate immunostimulants in this regard. At the same time, other microbe-derived preparations capable of inducing a state of trained immunity deserve attention. BCG and other bacterial immunostimulatory agents containing a large number of biologically active subunits have long been considered as objects of search for promising pharmacological substances. The review analyzes the linkages between BCG, mycobacterial adjuvants, bacterial lysates, trained immunity, muramylpeptides (MPs) and NOD2 receptors in light of the choice of a low molecular weight alternative to multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants for ARI prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search for key molecules by which bacteria stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses proceeds in a spiral. On different loops of this spiral, MPs have repeatedly reproduced the nonspecific effects of multicomponent bacterial adjuvants, vaccines and immunostimulants. MPs and peptidoglycans containing MPs determine the adjuvant properties of the cell walls of mycobacteria and their peptide-glycolipid fraction (wax D). MPs were able to replace Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freunds adjuvant. MPs determine the NOD2-dependent ability of BCG to induce trained immunity. Probably, MPs provide NOD2-mediated long-term prophylactic action of bacterial lysates. All of the above has prompted revisiting the previously obtained evidence of the efficacy of glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide (GMDP) as a NOD2 agonist in treatment/prevention of respiratory infections. We speculate here that MPs, in particular GMDP, at rational dosing regimens will be able to reproduce many aspects of the nonspecific effects of BCG and multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants in preventing ARI during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic period.","Kalyuzhin, O V; Andronova, T M; Karaulov, A V",Ter Arkh,473,1

A total of 103 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples taken from patients were investigated simultaneously with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs (Euroimmun) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM (Deep Blue) kits. No positivity was detected with any of the test kits in 18 (17.4%) of the 103 samples. In symptomatic patients, 100% of IgM and IgA tests were found to be positive in the group sampled after 10 days, while 100% of IgG tests were found positive after 20 days. The sensitivity of the Deep Blue COVID-19 IgG antibody kit was calculated as 81.48% and the specificity was 97.96%. While there was no statistically significant difference between the PCR CT and ELISA OD values, a positive correlation was found between the ELISA OD values and the days since the date of symptom initiation. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antibody test used in this study were found to be quite high. In conditions where ELISA tests cannot be applied, it is thought that it can give an idea in terms of the presence of antibodies as a simple and fast test.

Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the endocrinological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially in vulnerable individuals with pre-existing endocrinological health conditions. To date new information is emerging regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children but the literature is still scarce concerning this infection in patients with intracranial malignant neoplasms. We report a 9-year-old child infected with SARS-CoV-2 and recent diagnosis of suprasellar non-germinomatous germ cell tumor also suffering from diabetes insipidus and hypothalamic-pituitary failure (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypothalamic obesity and growth hormone deficiency) and its clinical course. The patient remained asymptomatic for the duration of the infection without requiring any change in the replacement therapeutic dosages taken before the infection. We then discuss the proposed approach to treat a pediatric patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypothalamic-pituitary failure and we include a review of the literature. Our report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually mild and self-limiting in children even those immunocompromised and with multiple endocrinological deficits.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the impact of implemented infectious control strategies on the incidences of influenza, enterovirus infection, and all-cause pneumonia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We utilized the electronic database of the Taiwan National Infectious Disease Statistics System and extracted incidences of COVID-19, influenza virus, enterovirus, and all-cause pneumonia. We compared the incidences of these diseases from week 45 of 2016 to week 21 of 2020 and performed linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The first case of COVID-19 in Taiwan was reported in late January 2020 (week 4). Infectious control strategies have been promoted since late January. The influenza virus usually peaks in winter and decreases around week 14. However, a significant decrease in influenza was observed after week 6 of 2020.

It then extended across the globe and was termed as a pandemic in 2020. Though research work on its vaccine and drugs are carried out across the globe, it is even necessary to look over it through alternative sciences. Objective: The objective of this study is to look over the disease through Ayurvedic perspective, analyse possible pathologies, select appropriate drugs and to study in-silico screening on these selected drugs.Materials & Methods: Available symptoms of Covid 19 were thoroughly studied and reviewed through Ayurveda classics, internet, preprints, etc. to understand the nature of the disease with the Ayurvedic perspective.The molecular Docking and Grid were generated through Pyrx Software with Autodock. The Lipinski Rule of Five data generated from Swiss ADME software and Target prediction of selected phytoconstituents were done by Swiss target prediction. Results: and Discussion: In Ayurveda, Covid19 can be considered as Janapadaudhwans, Vaat-Kaphaj Sannipatik Jwara, Aupsargika Vyadhi, and Dhatupaka Awastha. In the molecular docking study, the binding energy and inhibition of 6 Gingesulphonic acid from Zingiber Officinalis (Sunthi) is greater than hydroxychloroquine and quinine. Most of the selected phytoconstituents follow the Lipinski rule of five. Target prediction of selected phytoconstituents was done on target of SARS-COV-2, humoral immunity, and antiviral activity. Every selected phytoconstituents works on minimum one of the targets. Conclusion: Thus, from the above results obtained from reviewing Ayurveda classics and after the virtual screening of selected drugs we can conclude that Nagaraadi Kashaya(Sunthi, Puskarmoola, Kantakari, Guduchi) may have appreciable results in combating SARS-COV-2. Thus, Nagaraadi Kashayam, a classical formulation can be a trial candidate for conducting further clinical trial.","Gandhi, Abhay Jayprakash; Rupareliya, Jalpa Deepak; Shukla, V J; Donga, Shilpa B; Acharya, Rabinarayan",,473,1

However, adherence is improved when discharge instructions are provided in Spanish. This study was designed to assess the frequency of providing written discharge instructions in Spanish to patients who speak Spanish and request interpretation services, and to determine factors associated with receiving written discharge instructions in the preferred language in a pediatric emergency department (ED). METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of all discharges of Spanish-speaking patients who requested an interpreter in 1 year from a large urban pediatric ED and an associated community ED. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify patient and visit level characteristics associated with receiving written discharge instructions in Spanish. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of 11,545 patient encounters where a Spanish interpreter was requested received written discharge instructions in Spanish. Patients aged 1 to 3 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.87; 95% CI, 2.18-3.77) and aged 4 to 12 years (aOR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.6-2.65), those seen without a trainee (aOR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.25-1.5), and those with low acuity triage levels (aOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.29-1.97) were more likely to receive discharge instruction in Spanish. Female patients were less likely to receive Spanish discharge instructions (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.83-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Discharged pediatric ED patients often do not receive written instructions in the preferred language. Patient and provider factors are associated with receiving written instructions in Spanish. Quality improvement efforts are needed to ensure appropriate language discharge education.","Isbey, Sarah; Badolato, Gia; Kline, Jaclyn",Pediatr. emerg. care,473,1

This is in stark contrast with the pandemic-time situation. Many governments, at least initially, listened to the recommendations of expert advisers, most notably public health authorities, who proceeded from considerations of equality and common good. I suggest that we should continue on this path when the immediate threat of the disease is over. Other crises are already ongoing-poverty, conflicts, climate change, financial bubbles, and so on-and it would be good to use expert knowledge rather than interests and ideologies in dealing with them. To assist in this, I outline the characteristics of a new kind of counsellor, impartial adviser, who is normatively motivated by a sense of copathy and who takes into account all views, nice and not-so-nice alike.

Therefore, understanding the subcellular localization and interactions of a specific protein is crucial to uncover its biological function. The advent of proximity labeling (PL) has reshaped cellular proteomics in infection biology. PL utilizes a genetically modified enzyme that generates a ""labeling cloud"" by covalently labeling proteins in close proximity to the enzyme. Fusion of a PL enzyme to a specific antibody or a ""bait"" protein of interest in combination with affinity enrichment mass spectrometry (AE-MS) enables the isolation and identification of the cellular proximity proteome, or proxisome. This powerful methodology has been paramount for the mapping of membrane or membraneless organelles as well as for the understanding of hard-to-purify protein complexes, such as those of transmembrane proteins. Unsurprisingly, more and more infection biology research groups have recognized the potential of PL for the identification of host-pathogen interactions. In this chapter, we introduce the enzymes commonly used for PL labeling as well as recent promising advancements and summarize the major achievements in organelle mapping and nucleic acid PL. Moreover, we comprehensively describe the research on host-pathogen interactions using PL, giving special attention to studies in the field of virology.","Zapatero-Belinchón, Francisco José; Carriquí-Madroñal, Belén; Gerold, Gisa",Adv Virus Res,473,10

CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 95% of cases. We aimed to share the first case of coexistence of simple virilizing-type congenital adrenal hyperplasia [I172N mutation in the CYP21A], triple translocation [t(9;11;12)], and ovarian granulose cell tumor. METHODS: A 59-year-old female patient was presented to our clinic, complaining with abdominal pain and distension. Physical examination revealed palpable abdominal mass, virilism, ambiguous genitalia, clitoramegaly, and hyperpigmentation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a giant mass originating from the right tubo-ovarian structure. RESULTS: The patient was operated in the light of the clinico-radiological features mentioned above. A giant mass weighing 3500 g was detected on the right tubo-ovarian structure during laparotomy, and mass was excised with right tubo-ovarian structure. Immunohistochemical examination revealed ovarian granulosa cell tumor. The high serum concentration of 17-OH progesterone was measured at baseline and after 250-µg bolus of synthetic ACTH. In genetic analysis, we screened for six-point mutations, large deletions, and non-common mutations using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods, PCR, and sequencing of CYP21 gene respectively. The patient was detected to be homozygous for the I172N mutation. In addition, 50% of the metaphases examined had triple translocation [t(9;11;12)]. CONCLUSION: The coexistence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, triple chromosomal translocations, and ovarian granulosa cell tumor has not been described previously.

The present work scientifically analyzed the available data for primary air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO) from two major Indian cities, Lucknow and New Delhi. The analysis was based on air quality data for before lockdown and after lockdown (first phase of 21 days) periods of 21 days each. The results showed significant decline in the studied air pollution indices and demonstrated improvement of air quality in both the cities. The major impact was seen in the levels of PM2.5, NO2 and CO. The levels of SO2 showed less significant decline during the lockdown period. The results are presented with future perspectives to mitigate air pollution in near future by adopting the short and periodical lockdown as a tool.","Srivastava, Sudhakar; Kumar, Amit; Bauddh, Kuldeep; Gautam, Alok Sagar; Kumar, Sanjeev",Bull Environ Contam Toxicol,473,16

In this paper, we explore to what extent financial inclusion could help mitigate the increase in poverty using cross-country data across 78 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Unlike other recent cross-country studies, we show that financial inclusion is a key driver of poverty reduction in these countries. This effect is not direct, but indirect, by mitigating the detrimental effect that inequality has on poverty. Our findings are consistent across all the different measures of poverty used. Our forecasts suggest that the world's population living on less than $1.90 per day could increase from 8% to 14% by 2021, pushing nearly 400 million people into poverty. However, urgent improvements in financial inclusion could substantially reduce the impact on poverty.","Ahamed, Mostak; Guti'errez-Romero, Roxana",,473,24

The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic permeated into our environment and wildlife as well;in particular, concern has been raised about the viral occurrence and persistence in aquatic and marine ecosystems. The discharge of untreated wastewaters carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to sea mammals may have dramatic consequences on vulnerable species. The efficient transmission of coronaviruses raises questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), serving as a functional receptor for the viral spike (S) protein. This study aimed, through the comparative analysis of the ACE-2 receptor with the human one, at assessing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 for different species of marine mammals living in Italian waters. We also determined, by means of immunohistochemistry, ACE-2 receptor localization in the lung tissue from different cetacean species, in order to provide a preliminary characterization of ACE-2 expression in the marine mammal respiratory tracts. Furthermore, to evaluate if and how Italian wastewater management and coastal exposition to extreme weather events may led to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, geomapping data were carried out and overlapped. The results showed the potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure for marine mammals inhabiting Italian coastal waters, putting them at risk when swimming and feeding in specific risk areas. Thus, we highlighted the potential hazard of the reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its impact on marine mammals regularly inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, while also stressing the need for appropriate action in order to prevent further damage to specific vulnerable populations.","Audino, Tania Grattarola Carla Centelleghe Cinzia Peletto Simone Giorda Federica Florio Caterina Lucia Caramelli Maria Bozzetta Elena Mazzariol Sandro Guardo Giovanni Di Lauriano Giancarlo Casalone Cristina",Animals,473,28

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data in the China Lung Transplantation Registration from January 23, 2020, to March 23, 2020 (2020 cohort), compared with the same period in 2019 (2019 cohort). Pre- and post-lung transplantation management strategies, including measures aiming to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, were applied to all recipients, including 5 post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 transplants during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic period in China. RESULTS: Twenty-eight lung transplant procedures were performed, including lung transplant for 5 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to Coronavirus Disease 2019-related pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with the 2019 cohort, more patients with urgent conditions received transplantation in 2020, with a shorter pre-lung transplant admission time and early mobilization post-lung transplant. A large proportion (60%) of lung donations were transported on high-speed trains and commercial flights or highways and commercial flights. Grafts in the preservation containers were handed over to the receiving staff at the airport for 40% (10/25) of donations, which reduced the unnecessary quarantine of transporting staff entering the city. Listed candidates were urgently transferred to other qualified centers in 17.9% of cases (5/28), which reduced the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure in Coronavirus Disease 2019-designated hospitals. The 90-day survival of the transplant recipients in 2020 was 85.7%, including 3 of 5 recipients (60%) who had critically severe Coronavirus Disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplant and donation amid Coronavirus Disease 2019 can be performed safely with coordinated efforts on medical resource sharing and medical staff protection based on stratification of the infection risk. Outcomes were not compromised during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak. Lung transplantion can be regarded as salvage therapy for critical patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 with a confirmed positive turned negative virology status.","Wu, Bo; Huang, Man; Jiao, Guohui; Hu, Chunxiao; Yang, Yi; Jingyu, Chen",J. thorac. cardiovasc. sur,473,20

The study adopted the niche theory to empirically measure the degree of gratification fulfilled by OTT and TV, the similarity between OTT and TV and the competitive superiority of OTT and TV across seven micro-dimensions of gratification. The data for the study has been gathered from 223 online users across India. The results of the study reflect that OTT provides a higher degree of satisfaction across all seven dimensions of gratification with the greatest difference manifested in the convenience dimension. The niche overlap measures indicated that the highest level of similarity between TV and OTT is in providing gratification in the relaxation dimension, whereas the least similarity was observed in the convenience dimensions.

There is a critical need to understand the impact of the emerging variants on host response and disease dynamics to facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Syrian golden hamsters are the leading small animal model that recapitulates key aspects of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into hamsters with the ancestral virus (nCoV-WA1-2020) or VOC first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351) led to similar gross and histopathologic pulmonary lesions. Although differences in viral genomic copy numbers were noted in the lungs and oral swabs of challenged animals, infectious titers in the lungs were comparable. Antibody neutralization capacities varied, dependent on the original challenge virus and cross-variant protective capacity. Transcriptional profiling indicated significant induction of antiviral pathways in response to all three challenges with a more robust inflammatory signature in response to B.1.1.7. Furthermore, no additional mutations in the spike protein were detected at peak disease. In conclusion, the emerging VOC showed distinct humoral responses and transcriptional profiles in the hamster model compared to the ancestral virus.","Pinski, Amanda N; Clancy, Chad S; Gourdine, Tylisha; Shifflett, Kyle; Fletcher, Paige; Messaoudi, Ilhem",,473,24

DESIGN: Rapid scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from 1 January to 5 December 2020 using the LitCovid database and the Cochrane library. SETTING: International studies on the infectiousness of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. PARTICIPANTS: Studies were selected for inclusion if they defined asymptomatics as a separate cohort distinct from presymptomatics and if they provided a quantitative measure of the infectiousness of asymptomatics relative to symptomatics. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: PCR result (PCR studies), the rate of infection (mathematical modelling studies) and secondary attack rate (contact tracing studies) - in each case from asymptomatic in comparison with symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: There are only a limited number of published studies that report estimates of relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared with symptomatic individuals. 12 studies were included after the screening process. Significant differences exist in the definition of infectiousness. PCR studies in general show no difference in shedding levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals; however, the number of study subjects is generally limited. Two modelling studies estimate relative infectiousness to be 0.43 and 0.57, but both of these were more reflective of the infectiousness of undocumented rather than asymptomatic cases. The results from contact tracing studies include estimates of relative infectiousness of 0, but with insufficient evidence to conclude that it is significantly different from 1. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable heterogeneity in estimates of relative infectiousness highlighting the need for further investigation of this important parameter. It is not possible to provide any conclusive estimate of relative infectiousness, as the estimates from the reviewed studies varied between 0 and 1.","McEvoy, David; McAloon, Conor; Collins, Aine; Hunt, Kevin; Butler, Francis; Byrne, Andrew; Casey-Bryars, Miriam; Barber, Ann; Griffin, John; Lane, Elizabeth Ann; Wall, Patrick; More, Simon John",BMJ Open,473,16

One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. METHODS: We used data from 46,284 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by other social or psychiatric factors. CONCLUSION: Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health. This highlights the importance of interventions that support adaptive coping strategies during the pandemic.","Wright, Liam; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",PLoS One,473,24

Indeed, patients with asthma and allergy appear underrepresented in large reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In this review, we evaluate existing literature on this topic and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between asthma and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from several preclinical and clinical reports suggest a lower susceptibility for COVID-19 in patients with underlying type 2 airway inflammation including asthma that may be related to a reduced expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Corticosteroids further decrease expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, hence may also have a protective effect against infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, some studies suggest that the reported improvement in asthma control and a reduction in asthma exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic may be related to improvement in adherence to controller therapy and reduced exposure to triggers, such as other respiratory viruses and air pollutants. Recent data point towards differential susceptibility for COVID-19 among asthma patients based on their phenotype and/or endotype. On the basis of existing evidence, continuation with controller therapies is recommended for all patients with asthma. For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, adjustment of controllers and biologics should be based on a multidisciplinary decision. SUMMARY: Underrepresentation of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with asthma and related allergic diseases may be based on potentially protective underlying mechanisms, such as type 2 airway inflammation, downregulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptors, reduced exposures to triggers and improved adherence to controller medications. Although it is imperative that control should be maintained and asthma medications be continued in all patients, management of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2 including adjustment of controllers and biologics should be discussed on an individual basis.","Assaf, Sara M; Tarasevych, Svitlana P; Diamant, Zuzana; Hanania, Nicola A",Curr Opin Pulm Med,473,31

Here, we examined the temporal brain dynamics of explicit verbal associative learning between unfamiliar items. In the first experiment, 25 adults learned object-pseudoword associations during a 5-day training program allowing us to track the N400 dynamics across learning blocks within and across days. Successful learning was accompanied by an initial frontal N400 that decreased in amplitude across blocks during the first day and shifted to parietal sites during the last training day. In Experiment 2, we replicated our findings with 38 new participants randomly assigned to a consistent learning or an inconsistent learning group. The N400 amplitude modulations that we found, both within and between learning sessions, are taken to reflect the emergence of novel lexical traces even when learning concerns items for which no semantic information is provided. The shift in N400 topography suggests that different N400 neural generators may contribute to specific word learning steps through a balance between domain-general and language-specific mechanisms.","Ramos-Escobar, Neus; Laine, Matti; Sanseverino-Dillenburg, Mariana; Cucurell, David; François, Clément; Rodriguez-Fornells, Antoni",Neuroimage,473,16

DESIGN: We conducted a naturalistic observational study in the period from April to June 2020. SAMPLE: In two western Austrian provinces, a total of 2080 persons were observed in front of 24 grocery stores. MEASUREMENT: The frequencies and types of erroneous behavior in the use of face masks were collected using a standardized observation form. RESULTS: A total of 2080 persons were observed. Almost one-third of all observations (n = 648; 31.2%) showed erroneous behavior before positioning the face masks. Another 935 (45.0%) persons touched the face mask front during the adjustment via mouth and nose, 501 (24.1%) persons touched the face mask front in the period after the adjustment. A total of 116 (5.6%) persons showed erroneous behavior in each sequence of the observation unit. Overall, almost half of all people observed showed at least one erroneous behavior within the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The behavior of the general public in handling face masks is highly error-prone.

Sex-differences in infectious diseases are a common but neglected problem. METHODS: We used the national surveillance database of COVID-19 in mainland China to compared gender differences in attack rate (AR), proportion of severe and critical cases (PSCC) and case fatality rate (CFR) in relation to age, affected province, and onset-to-diagnosis interval. RESULTS: The overall AR was significantly higher in female population than in males (63.9 versus 60.5 per million persons; P Ë .001). By contrast, PSCC and CFR were significantly lower among female patients (16.9% and 4.0%) than among males (19.5% and 7.2%), with ORs of 0.87 and 0.57, respectively (both P Ë .001). The female-to-male differences were age-dependent, which were significant among people aged 50-69 years for AR, and in the patients of 30-years or older for both PSCC and CFR (all P &#8804; .001). The AR, PSCC and CFR varied greatly from province to province. However, female-to-male differences in AR, PSCC and CFR were significant in the epicenter, Hubei province, where 82.2% confirmed cases and 97.4% deaths occurred. After adjusting for age, affected province and onset-to-diagnosis interval, the female-to-male difference in AR, PSCC and CFR remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We elucidate an age-dependent gender dimorphism for COVID-19, in which the females have higher susceptibility but lower severity and fatality. Further epidemiological and biological investigations are required to better understand the sex-specific differences for effective interventions.","Qian, Jie; Zhao, Lin; Ye, Run-Ze; Li, Xiu-Jun; Liu, Yuan-Li",Clin. infect. dis,473,16

We also propose a method for forecasting case counts, which takes advantage of the common, latent information in the entire sample of curves, instead of just the history of a single country. Our framework facilitates to quantify the effects of demographic covariates and social mobility on doubling rates and case fatality rates through a time-varying regression model.

To quantify and possibly tune the efficacy of these anti-SARS-CoV-2 measures, we have devised indicators based on the abundant historic and current prevalence data from other respiratory viruses. METHODS: We obtained incidence data of 17 respiratory viruses from hospitalized patients and outpatients collected by 37 clinics and laboratories between 2010-2020 in Germany. With a probabilistic model for Bayes inference we quantified prevalence changes of the different viruses between months in the pre-pandemic period 2010-2019 and the corresponding months in 2020, the year of the pandemic with noninvasive measures of various degrees of stringency. RESULTS: We discovered remarkable reductions Î´ in rhinovirus (RV) prevalence by about 25% (95% highest density interval (HDI) [-0.35,-0.15]) in the months after the measures against SARS-CoV-2 were introduced in Germany. In the months after the measures began to ease, RV prevalence increased to low pre-pandemic levels, e.g. in August 2020 Î´=-0.14 (95% HDI [-0.28,0.12]). CONCLUSIONS: RV prevalence is negatively correlated with the stringency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 measures with only a short time delay. This result suggests that RV prevalence could possibly be an indicator for the efficiency for these measures.

This has thus been identified in some publications as representing a high incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), whereas in others, findings have been tempered by general lack of functional reactivity using confirmation assays of serotonin release assay (SRA) or heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA). Moreover, in at least two publications, data are provided suggesting that antibodies can arise in heparin naïve patients or that platelet activation may not be heparin-dependent. From this literature, we would conclude that platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies can be observed in COVID-19-infected patients, and they may occur at higher incidence than in historical non-COVID-19-infected cohorts. However, the situation is complex, since not all platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies may lead to platelet activation, and not all identified antibodies are heparin-dependent, such that they do not necessarily reflect ""true"" HIT. Most recently, a ""HIT-like"" syndrome has reported in patients who have been vaccinated against COVID-19.

Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) mediated by Ad26.COV2.S in a moderate disease Syrian hamster challenge model, using the currently most prevalent G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 variant. Vaccine doses of 1 × 109 and 1 × 1010 VP elicited substantial neutralizing antibodies titers and completely protected over 80% of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Syrian hamsters from lung infection and pneumonia but not upper respiratory tract infection. A second vaccine dose further increased neutralizing antibody titers that was associated with decreased infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Suboptimal non-protective immune responses elicited by low-dose A26.COV2.S vaccination did not exacerbate respiratory disease in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated Syrian hamsters with breakthrough infection. In addition, dosing down the vaccine allowed to establish that binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlate with lower respiratory tract protection probability. Overall, these preclinical data confirm efficacy of a one-dose vaccine regimen with Ad26.COV2.S in this G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 virus variant Syrian hamster model, show the added benefit of a second vaccine dose, and demonstrate that there are no signs of VAERD under conditions of suboptimal immunity.","van der Lubbe, Joan E M; Rosendahl Huber, Sietske K; Vijayan, Aneesh; Dekking, Liesbeth; van Huizen, Ella; Vreugdenhil, Jessica; Choi, Ying; Baert, Miranda R M; Feddes-de Boer, Karin; Izquierdo Gil, Ana; van Heerden, Marjolein; Dalebout, Tim J; Myeni, Sebenzile K; Kikkert, Marjolein; Snijder, Eric J; de Waal, Leon; Stittelaar, Koert J; Tolboom, Jeroen T B M; Serroyen, Jan; Muchene, Leacky; van der Fits, Leslie; Rutten, Lucy; Langedijk, Johannes P M; Barouch, Dan H; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Zahn, Roland C; Wegmann, Frank",NPJ Vaccines,473,1

Expansion of the pandemic will be expedited by factors such as an abundance of at-risk populations, inadequate COVID-19 mitigation efforts, sheer inability to comply with community mitigation strategies, and constrained national preparedness. This situation will reduce the benefits achieved through decades of disease control and health promotion measures, and the economic progress made during periods of global development. Without interventions, and as soon as international travel and trade resume, reservoirs of COVID-19 and other vaccine-preventable diseases in LDFCAC will continue 'feeding' developed countries with repeated infection seeds. Assuring LDFCAC equity in access to medical countermeasures, funds to mitigate the pandemic, and a paradigm change in the global development agenda, similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan for Europe, are urgently needed. We argue for a paradigm change in strategy, including a new global pandemic financing mechanism for COVID-19 and other future pandemics. This approach should assist LDFCAC in gaining access to and membership of a global interdisciplinary pandemic taskforce to enable in-country plans to train, leverage, and maintain essential functioning and also to utilize and enhance surveillance and early detection capabilities. Such a task force will be able to build on and expand research into the management of pandemics, protect vulnerable populations through international laws/treaties, and reinforce and align the development agenda to prevent and mitigate future pandemics.

Data are limited on the use and benefit of tracheostomies for intubated, critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. During the surge in COVID 19 infections in metropolitan New York/New Jersey, our hospital cared for many COVID-19 patients who required prolonged intubation. This study describes the outcomes in COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy. METHODS: We present a case series of patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy at a single institution. Tracheostomies were performed on patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation beyond 3 wk. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, and ventilator settings prior to tracheostomy were reviewed. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included time on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Fifteen COVID-19 patients underwent tracheostomy at an average of 31 d post intubation. Two patients (13%) died. Half of our cohort was liberated from the ventilator (8 patients, 53%), with an average time to liberation of 14 ± 6 d after tracheostomy. Among patients off mechanical ventilation, 5 (63%) had their tracheostomies removed prior to discharge. The average intensive care length of stay was 47 ± 13 d (range 29-74 d) and the average hospital stay was 59 ± 16 d (range 34-103 d). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports promising outcomes in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure and need for prolonged ventilation who undergo tracheostomy during their hospitalization. Further research is warranted to establish appropriate indications for tracheostomy in COVID-19 and confirm outcomes.","Goldstein, Carma; Deisher, David; Gorman, Elizabeth; Sheikh, Fariha; Sifri, Ziad; Glass, Nina E",J Surg Res,473,16

Objectives: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review on mortality associated to the use of ACEi in patients with COVID-19 disease. Methods: Search in Medline (PubMed), in ISI Web of Knowledge and in medRxiv database; use of other sources. Results: A total of 33 articles were evaluated. Concerning the papers used to produce the meta-analyses, 7 studies were selected, 5 of which were used. These 5 studies involved a total number of 944 patients treated with ACEi and 5173 not treated with ACEi. Increased mortality was seen in association to the use of ACEi in the context of COVID-19 disease (ACEi users vs nonusers; odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.15; Pâ=â.04). When compared to mortality in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, mortality of patients treated with ACEi was not significantly different (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.21; Pâ=â.74). Concerning the remaining reports, different types of data adjustments were used by several authors, after which increased mortality was not seen in association to the use of ACEi in this context. Conclusions: ACEi use could act as a marker of increased mortality risk in some but not all COVID-19 disease settings. The data now presented do not prove a causal relation but argue in favor of carrying out clinical trials studying ACEi in COVID-19 patients, to establish the safety of ACEi use in this context.","Nunes, José Pedro L",Porto Biomed J,473,29

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism and active chemicals in the ethanol extracts of V. patula (VP) and L. chinensis (LC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory activities of VP and LC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production were investigated in RAW264.7 macrophages and BV2 microglia. Downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of Nrf2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2)-ARE (antioxidant response element) pathway were investigated using RT-Q-PCR and Western blotting. Direct antioxidant capacities were measured using free radical scavenging and Folin-Ciocalteu assays. The flavonoids and triterpenes in VP and LC were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS. RESULTS: VP and LC inhibited NO and IL-6 production and suppressed iNOS, IL-6, IL-1ß and CCL2 gene expression. VP and LC were potent direct antioxidants and effective indirect antioxidants assayed by Nrf2 activation and induction of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Three flavonoids including apigenin (1), luteolin (2) and chryseriol (3), and one triterpene betulinic acid (4) were found in VP; while compounds 1-4 and oleanolic acid (5) were in LC. CONCLUSION: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of VP and LC may be in great part attributed to the identified Nrf2 activating compounds, which induce expression of Phase II enzymes and attenuate the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes.","Wu, Pei-Shan; Jeng, Jingyueh; Yang, Jeng-Jer; Kao, Vivia; Yen, Jui-Hung; Wu, Ming-Jiuan",J Ethnopharmacol,473,16

Several participants relayed the belief that the soul cannot rest until the body receives a proper burial while some worried about the deterioration of the physical condition of the mentors. In conclusion, findings provide insights into the importance of not overlooking the mental health implications of delaying the SMP in future outbreaks or crises.","Wong, Li Ping; Tan, Sik Loo; Alias, Haridah; Sia, Thiam Eng; Saw, Aik",Omega (Westport),473,16

Most of them are technically demanding due to the (hard to avoid) use of negative drift theorems - general results which translate an expected movement away from the target into a high hitting time. We propose a simple negative drift theorem for multiplicative drift scenarios and show that it can simplify existing analyses. We discuss in more detail Lehre's (PPSN 2010) negative drift in populations method, one of the most general tools to prove lower bounds on the runtime of non-elitist mutation-based evolutionary algorithms for discrete search spaces. Together with other arguments, we obtain an alternative and simpler proof of this result, which also strengthens and simplifies this method. In particular, now only three of the five technical conditions of the previous result have to be verified. The lower bounds we obtain are explicit instead of only asymptotic. This allows to compute concrete lower bounds for concrete algorithms, but also enables us to show that super-polynomial runtimes appear already when the reproduction rate is only a (1-&#969;(n-1/2)) factor below the threshold. For the special case of algorithms using standard bit mutation with a random mutation rate (called uniform mixing in the language of hyper-heuristics), we prove the result stated by Dang and Lehre (PPSN 2016) and extend it to mutation rates other than &#920;(1/n), which includes the heavytailed mutation operator proposed by Doerr, Le, Makhmara, and Nguyen (GECCO 2017). We finally use our method and a novel domination argument to show an exponential lower bound for the runtime of the mutation-only simple genetic algorithm on ONEMAX for arbitrary population size.","Doerr, Benjamin",Evol Comput,473,16

However, sewage transmission has never been shown. In April 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak occurred in a densely populated community in Guangzhou, China. We investigated this outbreak to identify the mode of transmission. METHOD: A home quarantined order was issued in the community. We collected throat swab samples from the residents and environmental samples from the surfaces inside and around the houses, and conducted RT-PCR testing and genome sequencing. We defined a case as a resident in this community with a positive RT-PCR test, with or without symptoms. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all residents living in the same buildings as the cases to identify exposure risk factors. RESULT: We found eight cases (four couples) in this community of 2888 residents (attack rate=2.8/1000), with onset during April 5-21, 2020. During their incubation periods, Cases 1-2 frequented market T with an ongoing outbreak. Cases 3-8 never visited market T during incubation period, lived in separate buildings from, and never interacted with, Cases 1-2. Retrospective cohort study showed that working as cleaners or waste picker (RR=13, 95% CIexact: 2.3-180), not changing to clean shoes after returning home (RR=7.4, 95% CIexact: 1.8-34), collating and cleaning dirty shoes after returning home (RR=6.3, 95% CIexact: 1.4-30) were significant exposure risk factors. Of 63 samples collected from street-sewage puddles and sewage-pipe surfaces, 19% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 50 environmental samples taken from cases' apartments, 24% tested positive. Viral genome sequencing showed that the viruses identified from the squat toilet and shoe-bottom dirt inside the apartment of Cases 1-2 were homologous with those from Cases 3-8 and those identified from sewage samples. The sewage pipe leading from the apartment of Cases 1-2 to the drainage had a large hole above ground. Rainfalls after the onset of Cases 1-2 flooded the streets. CONCLUSION: Our investigation has for the first time pointed to the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might spread by sewage. This finding highlighted the importance of sewage management, especially in densely-populated places with poor hygiene and sanitation measures, such as urban slums and other low-income communities in developing countries.","Yuan, Jun; Chen, Zongqiu; Gong, Chenghua; Liu, Hui; Li, Baisheng; Li, Kuibiao; Chen, Xi; Xu, Conghui; Jing, Qinlong; Liu, Guocong; Qin, Pengzhe; Liu, Yufei; Zhong, Yi; Huang, Lijuan; Zhu, Bao-Ping; Yang, Zhicong",Clin. infect. dis,473,1

The pandemic has shown that there is still a delay in the early response to disease outbreaks and needs a method for unknown disease outbreak detection. The study's objective is to establish a new medical knowledge representation and reasoning model, and use the model to explore the feasibility of unknown disease outbreak detection. Methods: The study defined abnormal values with diagnostic significances from clinical data as the Features, and defined the Features as the antecedents of inference rules to match with knowledge bases, achieved in detecting known or emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Meanwhile, the study built a syndromic surveillance base to capture the target cases' Features to improve the reliability and fault-tolerant ability of the system. Results: The study combined the method with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and early COVID-19 outbreaks as empirical studies. The results showed that with suitable surveillance guidelines, the method proposed in this study was capable to detect outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and early COVID-19 pandemics. The quick matching accuracies of confirmed infection cases were 89.1, 26.3-98%, and 82%, and the syndromic surveillance base would capture the Features of the remaining cases to ensure the overall detection accuracies. Based on the early COVID-19 data in Wuhan, this study estimated that the median time of the early COVID-19 cases from illness onset to local authorities' responses could be reduced to 7.0-10.0 days. Conclusions: This study offers a new solution to transfer traditional medical knowledge into structured data and form diagnosis rules, enables the representation of doctors' logistic thinking and the knowledge transmission among different users. The results of empirical studies demonstrate that by constantly inputting medical knowledge into the system, the proposed method will be capable to detect unknown diseases from existing ones and perform an early response to the initial outbreaks.","Feng, Rui; Hu, Qiping; Jiang, Yingan",Front Public Health,473,24

With three SME case studies as samples–one micro, one small and one medium-sized organisation in Ireland–we consider the influence of the founders' international experience in the design and application of formal and informal HRM strategies (at the organisational level) that are operationalised to recruit and retain international talent to/in these organisations.FindingsThe HRM practices in the three SME cases in this paper, each run by migrant founders, vary from formalised (for our medium-sized organisation), semi-formalised (for our small-sized organisation) to ad hoc and tailor-made (for our micro-sized organisation). These particular SMEs were often more receptive to hiring other migrants.

Yet, the sequence of the entire virus genome from China in the current public database is very unevenly distributed with reference to time and place of collection. In particular, only one sequence was obtained in Henan province, adjacent to China's worst-case province, Hubei Province. Herein, we used high-throughput sequencing techniques to get 19 whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 18 severe patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, a provincial designated hospital for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases in Henan province. The demographic, baseline, and clinical characteristics of these patients were described. To investigate the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 of the current COVID-19 outbreak in China, 729 genome sequences (including 19 sequences from this study) sampled from Mainland China were analyzed with state-of-the-art comprehensive methods, including likelihood-mapping, split network, ML phylogenetic, and Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analyses. We estimated that the evolutionary rate and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 from Mainland China were 9.25 x 10(-4) substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 6.75 x 10(-4) to 1.28 x 10(-3)) and October 1, 2019 (95% BCI: August 22, 2019 to November 6, 2019), respectively.

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended prioritization of HCP for COVID-19 vaccination to maintain provision of critical services and reduce spread of infection in health care settings (2). Early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to HCP allowed assessment of the effectiveness of these vaccines in a real-world setting. A test-negative case-control study is underway to evaluate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic illness among HCP at 33 U.S. sites across 25 U.S. states. Interim analyses indicated that the VE of a single dose (measured 14 days after the first dose through 6 days after the second dose) was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-87%), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. The adjusted VE of 2 doses (measured &#8805;7 days after the second dose) was 94% (95% CI = 87%-97%). VE of partial (1-dose) and complete (2-dose) vaccination in this population is comparable to that reported from clinical trials and recent observational studies, supporting the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic disease in adults, with strong 2-dose protection.","Pilishvili, Tamara; Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E; Farrar, Jennifer L; Gierke, Ryan; Mohr, Nicholas M; Talan, David A; Krishnadasan, Anusha; Harland, Karisa K; Smithline, Howard A; Hou, Peter C; Lee, Lilly C; Lim, Stephen C; Moran, Gregory J; Krebs, Elizabeth; Steele, Mark; Beiser, David G; Faine, Brett; Haran, John P; Nandi, Utsav; Schrading, Walter A; Chinnock, Brian; Henning, Daniel J; LoVecchio, Frank; Nadle, Joelle; Barter, Devra; Brackney, Monica; Britton, Amber; Marceaux-Galli, Kaytlynn; Lim, Sarah; Phipps, Erin C; Dumyati, Ghinwa; Pierce, Rebecca; Markus, Tiffanie M; Anderson, Deverick J; Debes, Amanda K; Lin, Michael; Mayer, Jeanmarie; Babcock, Hilary M; Safdar, Nasia; Fischer, Marc; Singleton, Rosalyn; Chea, Nora; Magill, Shelley S; Verani, Jennifer; Schrag, Stephanie",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,473,1

Therefore, an understanding of how popular media are used as a vital disseminator of food safety and health information for the public is more important than ever. YouTube deserves particular attention as one of the most highly trafficked Web sites on the Internet, especially because YouTube has been blamed during the pandemic for spreading misleading or untrustworthy information that contradicts validated information. This study was conducted to evaluate the food safety information and practices circulating on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic and the alignment of these practices with recommendations from government agencies. A search for videos on YouTube was conducted using the key words ""food and COVID-19,"" ""food safety and COVID-19,"" and ""groceries and COVID-19."" After applying a series of inclusive and exclusive criteria, 85 videos from the United States and Canada were evaluated. More than half (69%) of the videos presented hand washing procedures, 26% showed kitchen disinfection, and most (86%) showed take-out food or grocery store practices. Multiple produce washing procedures were also shown throughout videos. Food was not considered hazardous in 39% of the videos, but 24% mentioned that food packaging is potentially hazardous. Most videos cited government agencies and had a host or guest who was a health care professional, professor, or expert. Three videos were not aligned with a government agency's guideline or information cited; two were presented by a health care professional. These findings reveal the need to develop educational interventions that increase YouTube video host and guest awareness of social media use as a tool for food safety dissemination and the need to provide trustworthy information.","Thomas, Merlyn; Haynes, Peyton; Archila-Godínez, Juan C; Nguyen, Mai; Xu, Wenqing; Feng, Yaohua",J Food Prot,473,1

METHODS: A national online bilingual American Sign Language/English survey was conducted from April 17 to May 1, 2020. Weighted sample of 474 DHH adults living in the United States. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine independent associations of sociodemographic variables and health indicators with perceived COVID-19 health consequences. RESULTS: About 44% of the medical condition sample used the Internet (English-based text) first for COVID-19 information, followed by TV (24%). Only 1% selected healthcare provider as the go-to source; the remainder got information from family or friends. Perceived health consequences increased with age (adjusted OR = 1.04; CI 95% = 1.02, 1.06). At-risk respondents who self-identified as persons of color were nearly three times more likely to believe that their health will be severely affected by COVID-19 compared to respondents who self-identified as white (adjusted OR = 2.94; CI 95% = 1.20, 7.18).

On the contrary, the prevalence in COVID patients of diseases of the adrenal glands has not been reported. Since the visualization of the adrenal glands is almost always available in chest CT performed in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the evaluation of the frequency and characteristics of morphological disorders of the adrenal masses in such patients appears of interest. We carried out a prospective consecutive series of 402 patients (M 222, 55.2%;F 180, 44.8%) with a median age of 76 years (IQR 64–84 years), admitted in the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. One hundred patients had a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of infection on a naso-pharyngeal swab (24.9%). All patients underwent a chest MDCT study including the adrenal region and clinical assessment of co-morbidities. Compared to subjects without confirmed disease, COVID patients had more frequently close contact with other positive subjects (24% vs 4.6%, p &amp;lt;0.001), typical symptoms (68% vs 28.5%, p &amp;lt;0.001), and suggestive chest CT findings (90% vs 31.1%, p &amp;lt;0.001). We found altered adrenal morphology in 100 patients (24.9%): 62 subjects had adrenal hyperplasia, which was unilateral in 42 of them (67.7%) and bilateral in 20 (32.3%), while 38 patients had discrete adrenal nodules, unilateral in 34 of them (89.4%) and bilateral in 4 (10.6%). The median size of adrenal nodules was 16 mm (10–50 mm) with a median density of 10 HU (-41 - 42 HU). In 17 patients with adrenal hyperplasia, a previous CT was available for comparison: in all cases an increase in thickness was evident at admission (from 1 to 15 mm, with a median of 1.95 mm increase). COVID patients had a higher frequency of adrenal nodules (12% vs 8.6%, p=NS). Sixty-three patients (16%) died. They were older (80 vs 74 years, p = 0.001), had a higher frequency of adrenal hyperplasia (25% vs 14%, p = 0.03), more frequent active cancer disease (37% vs 19%, p = 0.003) and COVID (23% vs 13.2%, p = 0.02). In a multivariate model, adrenal hyperplasia is an independent risk factor for mortality (OR 2.52, 1.15–5.55, p=0.02), as well as age (OR 1.04, 1.01–1.07, p=0.005), active oncological disease (OR 3.06, 1.44–6.49, p=0.004), and COVID (OR 2.88, 1.38–6.01, p=0.005). This is the first study reporting the prevalence of morphological alterations of adrenal glands in suspected COVID patients. The frequency of discrete adrenal nodules (9.5%) is in line with the high prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas in elder subjects. The high frequency of adrenal hyperplasia associated with increased risk of mortality suggests that this may be the consequence of an exaggerated activation of the HPA axis due to a highly stressful condition.","Reimondo, Giuseppe Solitro Federica Puglisi Soraya Casale Davide Tiranti Giorgio Maria Perini Anna Cultrera Alessandra Pia Anna Terzolo Massimo Veltri Andrea",Journal of the Endocrine Society,473,10

METHODS: This study invited college students from various provinces of China to participate in the survey through the Internet, and a total of 1,461 college students were included. T-test and analysis of variance were used to explore the relationship between demographic characteristics, social pressure, knowledge and risk perception. Multiple linear regression was used to identify factors associated with risk perception. RESULTS: This study shows that college students in China have high risk perception of COVID-19. Female college students (p<0.01), non-medical students (p<0.01), college students whose schools are located in Hubei (p = 0.01) and college students with higher knowledge level (p<0.01) have higher risk perception. CONCLUSION: Due to the strong infectivity and occult nature of COVID-19, it is necessary to improve the risk perception of college students through health education in various ways, and attention should be paid to some college students with low risk perception.","Ding, Yani; Du, Xueying; Li, Qinmei; Zhang, Miao; Zhang, Qingjun; Tan, Xiaodong; Liu, Qing",PLoS One,473,24

Shed ß2-m is measurable in circulation, and various disorders are accompanied by increases in ß2-m levels, including several viral infections. Therefore, we explored whether ß2-m levels could also be elevated in Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and whether they predict disease severity. Serum ß2-m levels were measured in a cohort of 34 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 on admission to a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as well as in an approximately age-sex matched group of 34 uninfected controls. Mean ß2-m level was 3.25±1.68 mg/l (reference range 0.8-2.2 mg/l) in patients (mean age 48.2±21.6) and 1.98±0.61 mg/l in controls (mean age 48.2±21.6). 17 patients (mean age 36.9± 18.0) with mean ß2-m levels of 2.27±0.64 mg/l had mild disease by WHO severity categorization, 12 patients (mean age 53.3±18.1) with mean ß2-m levels of 3.57±1.39 mg/l had moderate disease, and five patients (of whom 2 died; mean age 74.4±13.8) with mean ß2-m levels of 5.85±1.85 mg/l had severe disease (P < = 0.001, by ANOVA test for linear trend). In multivariate ordinal regression ß2-m levels were the only significant predictor of disease severity. Our findings suggest that higher ß2-m levels could be an early indicator of severity of disease and predict outcome of Covid-19. As the main limitations of the study are a single-center study, sample size and ethnicity, these results need confirmation in larger cohorts outside the Arabian Peninsula in order to delineate the value of ß2-m measurements. The role of ß2-m in the etiology and pathogenesis of severe Covid-19 remains to be elucidated.","Conca, Walter; Alabdely, Mayyadah; Albaiz, Faisal; Foster, Michael Warren; Alamri, Maha; Alkaff, Morad; Al-Mohanna, Futwan; Nagelkerke, Nicolaas; Almaghrabi, Reem Saad",PLoS One,473,30

In particular, we focus on how the robot turns and the distance it keeps from objects, with the goal of planning suitable trajectories for an autonomously moving immersive telepresence robot in mind; rotational acceleration is known for causing the majority of VR sickness, and distance to objects modulates the optical flow. We ran a within-subjects user study (n = 36, women = 18) in which the participants watched three panoramic videos recorded in a virtual museum while aboard an autonomously moving telepresence robot taking three different paths varying in aspects such as turns, speeds, or distances to walls and objects. We found a moderate correlation between the users' sickness as measured by the SSQ and comfort on a 6-point Likert scale across all paths. However, we detected no association between sickness and the choice of the most comfortable path, showing that sickness is not the only factor affecting the comfort of the user. The subjective experience of turn speed did not correlate with either the SSQ scores or comfort, even though people often mentioned turning speed as a source of discomfort in the open-ended questions. Through exploring the open-ended answers more carefully, a possible reason is that the length and lack of predictability also play a large role in making people observe turns as uncomfortable. A larger subjective distance from walls and objects increased comfort and decreased sickness both in quantitative and qualitative data. Finally, the SSQ subscales and total weighted scores showed differences by age group and by gender.","Suomalainen, Markku; Mimnaugh, Katherine J.; Becerra, Israel; Lozano, Eliezer; Murrieta-Cid, Rafael; LaValle, Steven M.",,473,16

Many controversies exist related to the safety and effectiveness of this combination, and questions about how HCQ-AZM combination affects the ventricular repolarization are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to show whether the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZM) combination prolonged Tpeak-to-end (TpTe) duration and TpTe/QT interval ratio or not. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six consequent COVID-19(+) patients meeting the study criteria were enrolled in this study. Baseline ECGs were obtained immediately after hospitalization and before commencing the HCQ-AZM combination. On-treatment ECG was obtained 24-48 hr after the loading dose of HCQ/AZM. ECG parameters including PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTc interval, TpTe duration, and TpTe/QT interval ratio were assessed. Demographic and laboratory findings were collected from an electronic recording system. RESULTS: ECGs of 126 COVID-19(+) patients who received HCQ-AZM combination were assessed. Mean baseline QTc (by Fridericia formula), TpTe, and TpTe/QT ratio were 420.0 ± 26.5 ms, 82.43 ± 9.77 ms, and 0.22 ± 0.02, respectively. On-treatment QTc, TpTe and TpTe/QT ratio were 425.7 ± 27.18 ms, 85.17 ± 11.17 ms, and 0.22 ± 0.03, respectively. No statistically significant acute impacts of HCQ-AZM combination on TpTe duration and TpTe/QT interval ratio were observed compared with baseline values. No ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation and the significant conduction delays were seen during in-hospital follow-up. CONCLUSION: HCQ-AZM combination increased TpTe duration.

We used boosted regression trees (an advanced form of regression analysis based on machine learning) to model relationships between responses to the questionnaires and decision-making tasks. Results showed that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted participants' responses to the framing problems and utilitarian/deontological and altruistic/egoistic moral dilemmas (but not to the dictator game).

Many viruses, including coronavirus and influenza virus, wreak havoc on the control of cytokine expression, leading to the formation of detrimental cytokine storms. Understanding the regulation and interplay between inflammatory cytokines is critical to the identification of targets involved in controlling the induction of cytokine expression. In this study, we focused on how the antiviral cytokine interleukin-27 (IL-27) regulates signal transduction downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 ligation, which recognize endosomal single-stranded RNA. Given that IL-27 alters bacterial-sensing TLR expression on myeloid cells and can inhibit replication of single-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated whether IL-27 affects expression and function of TLR7 and TLR8. Analysis of IL-27-treated THP-1 monocytic cells and THP-1-derived macrophages revealed changes in mRNA and protein expression of TLR7 and TLR8. Although treatment with IL-27 enhanced TLR7 expression, only TLR8-mediated cytokine secretion was amplified.

However, in many real-world settings units are interconnected by social, physical or virtual ties and the effect of a treatment can spill from one unit to other connected individuals in the network. In these settings, interference should be taken into account to avoid biased estimates of the treatment effect, but it can also be leveraged to save resources and provide the intervention to a lower percentage of the population where the treatment is more effective and where the effect can spill over to other susceptible individuals. In fact, different people might respond differently not only to the treatment received but also to the treatment received by their network contacts. Understanding the heterogeneity of treatment and spillover effects can help policy-makers in the scale-up phase of the intervention, it can guide the design of targeting strategies with the ultimate goal of making the interventions more cost-effective, and it might even allow generalizing the level of treatment spillover effects in other populations. In this paper, we develop a machine learning method that makes use of tree-based algorithms and an Horvitz-Thompson estimator to assess the heterogeneity of treatment and spillover effects with respect to individual, neighborhood and network characteristics in the context of clustered network interference. We illustrate how the proposed binary tree methodology performs in a Monte Carlo simulation study. Additionally, we provide an application on a randomized experiment aimed at assessing the heterogeneous effects of information sessions on the uptake of a new weather insurance policy in rural China.","Bargagli-Stoffi, Falco J.; Tortu, Costanza; Forastiere, Laura",,473,26

Here we adopt the use of CRISPR/Cas12a to identify the tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), a new and emerging tobamovirus which is causing substantial damage to the global tomato industry. Specific CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) were designed to detect either ToBRFV or the closely related tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). This technology enabled the differential detection of ToBRFV and ToMV. Sensitivity assays revealed that viruses can be detected from 15–30 ng of RT-PCR product, and that specific detection could be achieved from a mix of ToMV and ToBRFV. In addition, we show that this method can enable the identification of ToBRFV in samples collected from commercial greenhouses. These results demonstrate a new method for species-specific detection of tobamoviruses. A future combination of this approach with isothermal amplification could provide a platform for efficient and user-friendly ways to distinguish between closely related strains and resistance-breaking pathogens.","Alon, Dan Mark Hak Hagit Bornstein Menachem Pines Gur Spiegelman Ziv",Plants,473,24

However, quantitative information on the relative importance of transmission pathways of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains limited. To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we developed a modeling framework and leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors. A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R 2 > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R 2 > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases across the entire simulation period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of larger respiratory droplets and smaller respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among the passengers, even considering a conservative assumption of high ventilation rates and no air recirculation conditions for the cruise ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions.","Azimi, Parham; Keshavarz, Zahra; Cedeno Laurent, Jose Guillermo; Stephens, Brent; Allen, Joseph G",Proc.

METHODS: Counties in the USA were categorised into five groups by level of social vulnerability, using the Social Vulnerability Index (a widely used measure of social disadvantage) developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The incidence and mortality from COVID-19, and the prevalence of major chronic conditions were calculated relative to the least vulnerable quintile using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Among 3141 counties, there were 5 010 496 cases and 161 058 deaths from COVID-19 by 10 August 2020. Relative to the least vulnerable quintile, counties in the most vulnerable quintile had twice the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths (rate ratios 2.11 (95% CI 1.97 to 2.26) and 2.42 (95% CI 2.22 to 2.64), respectively). Similarly, the prevalence of major chronic conditions was 24%-41% higher in the most vulnerable counties. Geographical clustering of counties with high COVID-19 mortality, high chronic disease prevalence and high social vulnerability was found, especially in southern USA. CONCLUSION: Some counties are experiencing a confluence of epidemics from COVID-19 and chronic diseases in the context of social disadvantage. Such counties are likely to require enhanced public health and social support.","Islam, Nazrul; Lacey, Ben; Shabnam, Sharmin; Erzurumluoglu, A Mesut; Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Chowell, Gerardo; Kawachi, Ichiro; Marmot, Michael",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),473,33

A previously validated finite element model of the intact L1-S1 segments was used. Three different anterior and one posterior surgical fixation approaches for tuberculosis were performed in L3-L5. Three different anterior surgical models were constructed according to the anterior approaches involving debridement, bone graft with or without titanium mesh, and internal fixation with different number of screws and rods. The posterior surgical approach involved transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement, bone graft, and internal fixation. Range of motion and intradiscal pressure of segments adjacent to the fusion were assessed, and biomechanical influences were compared. Intradiscal pressure and range of motion of the adjacent L2/3 and L5/S1 increased during different physiological movements after anterior and/or posterior surgical approaches as compared to baseline values. Comparison between the biomechanical values assessed after different anterior surgical approaches yielded no significant difference. After anterior and posterior surgical approaches were performed on the same model, there were no significant differences in intradiscal pressure and range of motion of the adjacent L2/3 and L5/S1. Anterior and/or posterior lumbar surgical approaches increased range of motion and intradiscal pressure in L2/3 and L5/S1, suggesting each lumbar surgical approach assessed has the potential risk of adjacent segment degeneration.

Three alternative polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA: amorphous PHA and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), P(3HB)) production scenarios were considered to assess its environmental impact: Scenario A - Production of mcl-PHA/P(3HB) from crude vegetable oil; Scenario B - Production of P(3HB) with biodiesel by-product; Scenario C - Production of mcl-PHA/P(3HB) from used vegetable oil. Subject to the scenario considered, it was shown that the environmental efficiency of PHA production is highly dependent on carbon sources used, and it is strongly supporting production of mcl-PHA instead of P(3HB). As LCA study shows, due to low yield of P(3HB) in comparison to mcl-PHA production in considered processes, all the P(3HB) production scenarios have higher impacts than the production of mcl-PHA. Production processes based on bacterial fermentation had its impacts related mostly to the raw materials used and to its separation phase. Additionally, using secondary materials instead of raw ones, namely used oil instead of virgin oil, gives significant improvement with regard to environmental impact. The resource efficiency is also the identified as the key factor with sensitivity analysis that indicates the possible increase of biopolymer yield as the most beneficial factor. Biobased polymers have big environmental potential but still need significant improvement with regard to their manufacturing processes in order to become more economically benign. Preferably production of these microbial polymers should be integrated into biorefinery blocks, where such waste stream arises (e.g. biodiesel production plant).","Nitkiewicz, Tomasz; Wojnarowska, Magdalena; Soltysik, Mariusz; Kaczmarski, Adam; Witko, Tomasz; Ingrao, Carlo; Guzik, Maciej",Sci Total Environ,473,20

METHODS: The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from six studies. The prognostic performance of vitamin D serum levels for predicting adverse outcomes with detection of the best cutoff threshold was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining vitamin D levels and clinical features was applied to predict severity in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Mean vitamin D serum level of 376 patients, was 21.9 nmol/L (95% CI = 15.36-28.45). Significant heterogeneity was found (I2 = 99.1%, p < .001). Patients with poor prognosis (N = 150) had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D compared with those with good prognosis (N = 161), representing an adjusted standardized mean difference of -0.58 (95% Cl = -0.83 to -0.34, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Serum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency could be a helpful adjunct in assessing patients' potential of developing severe COVID-19. Appropriate preventative and/or therapeutic intervention may improve COVID-19 outcomes.","Munshi, Ruhul; Hussein, Mohammad H; Toraih, Eman A; Elshazli, Rami M; Jardak, Christina; Sultana, Nasrin; Youssef, Mohanad R; Omar, Mahmoud; Attia, Abdallah S; Fawzy, Manal S; Killackey, Mary; Kandil, Emad; Duchesne, Juan",J Med Virol,473,21

Introduction: Since the discovery of the microscope, we have known that individuals living in close proximity to each other share not only their visible habitat, but also invisible microorganisms that have adapted to some degree to their hosts. However, as human habitat expands and, in parallel, animal territory declines, new animal species can come into dangerous proximity, which may result in consequential transmission of microbes and different microbial behaviour in the new host. Presumably, this phenomenon led to the development of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first appeared in humans in 2019 and infected millions over the course of a few months worldwide. All possible means must be used to combat the pandemic and prevent further epidemics, which will require cooperation between professionals in human medicine and veterinary medicine as well as in the ecological, evolutionary and environmental sciences, within the framework of the global ""One Health"". In a spirit of working together for common goals, the authors of this study, a veterinarian and a human physician, summarize the knowledge that may be relevant to both professions for SARS-CoV-2. The origin of the virus, its natural and artificial occurrence in different animal species, and experiences with animal coronaviruses that may contribute to the understanding of the functioning of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of protection against it are presented.

One response is to re-partner tazobactam with cefepime, which is easier to protect, being less ß-lactamase labile, and to use a high-dose and prolonged infusion. On this basis, Wockhardt are developing cefepime/tazobactam (WCK 4282) as a 2+2 g q8h combination with a 90-min infusion. METHODS: The activity of cc cefepime/tazobactam was assessed, with other tazobactam combinations as comparators, against 1632 Enterobacterales, 745 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 450 other non-fermenters, as submitted to the UK National Reference Laboratory. These were categorised by carbapenemase-gene detection and interpretive reading of phenotypes, with MICs determined by British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy agar dilution. RESULTS: Although higher breakpoints may be justifiable, based on the pharmacodynamics, the results were reviewed against current cefepime criteria. On this basis, cefepime/tazobactam was broadly active against Enterobacterales with AmpC enzymes and extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs), even when they had ertapenem resistance, suggesting porin loss. At 8+8 mg/L, activity extended to > 90% of Enterobacterales with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemases, although the MICs for KPC producers belonging to the international Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 lineage were higher; metallo-ß-lactamase producers remained resistant. Cefepime/tazobactam was less active than ceftolozane/tazobactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with AmpC de-repression or high-level efflux but achieved wider antipseudomonal coverage than piperacillin/tazobactam. Activity against other non-fermenters was species-specific. CONCLUSION: Overall, cefepime/tazobactam had a spectrum exceeding those of piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam and resembling or exceeding that of carbapenems. Used as a 'new-combination of old-agents' it has genuine potential to be 'carbapenem-sparing'.","Mushtaq, Shazad; Garello, Paolo; Vickers, Anna; Woodford, Neil; Livermore, David M",Int J Antimicrob Agents,473,30

C/HRE can support children and young people to understand and explore the issues which limit people's lives and consider actions to uphold their own rights and the rights of others. The breadth and depth of the provision of HRE can be considered across 'education about rights' (including knowledge and understanding of human rights values, norms and frameworks), 'education through rights' (rights respecting educational approaches) and 'education for rights' (empowerment to realising and upholding rights) (UN 2011). The paper situates this framework against three additional dimensions. Firstly, it considers the children's rights issues within a historical national context. Secondly, it explores the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the education rights of children in Ireland. Finally, with a future orientation, the paper considers how C/HRE can strengthen education, meeting the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, the legacies of longstanding children's rights issues, and future human rights challenges.","Mallon, B.; Martinez-Sainz, G.",Irish Educational Studies,473,23

The survey was conducted online during the period of national lockdown in 2020 and collected information on hours allocated to paid work, housework, child care, educational childcare and leisure by both members of the couple before and during the lockdown, as well as socio-demographic characteristics. Our sample consists of 961 couples of which 785 have children. Our results indicate that during the lockdown, despite a reduction in time assigned to paid work and an increase in time spent in unpaid activities for both members of the couple, gender gaps regarding the latter increased. Specifically, while the load of men and women's work for pay became more equitable, women took up a larger proportion of the additional housework and childcare. We found that some factors mitigated (whether the man reduced his hours of work or whether both partners kept on doing so) while others potentiated (whether the woman reduced her hours of work, whether she continued working from home, or whether the couple outsourced housework before lockdown) the changes in the within-couple gender gaps in unpaid activities.","Costoya, Victoria; Echeverría, Lucía; Edo, María; Rocha, Ana; Thailinger, Agustina",J Fam Econ Issues,473,1

The current Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. RESULTS: One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour. Adjusted for the type of accommodation food seeking behaviour and irritability is increased to a significantly lesser extent in people with PWS accommodated in specialised care facilities compared with those living in their family home. No significant difference could be found between the sexes. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food-seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care. Individuals living with their families were particularly vulnerable, indicating that they and their families are in special need of support.","Wieting, J; Eberlein, C; Bleich, S; Frieling, H; Deest, M",J Intellect Disabil Res,473,16

One observed driver of a culture of wellness is perceived appreciation. The authors identified several contributors to perceived appreciation among faculty at a large, metropolitan academic institution through use of a novel survey. METHODS: The authors surveyed clinical faculty in five departments: psychiatry, emergency medicine, internal medicine, thoracic surgery, and radiology. Two open-ended response questions assessed sources of perceived and lack of perceived appreciation in narrative form. The authors also collected data on gender and department identity. Grounded theory methodology was used to analyze the narrative responses and design thinking to brainstorm specific recommendations based on the main themes identified. RESULTS: A total of 179 faculty respondents filled out the survey for an overall response rate of 29%. Major drivers of perceived appreciation were patient and families (42%); physician, trainee and non-physician colleagues (32.7%); chairs (10%); and compensation (3.3%). Major drivers of perceived lack of appreciation were disrespect for time and skill level, including inadequate staffing (30%); devaluation by a physician colleague, chief of one's service or the chair (29%); poor communication and transparency (13%); and patient and family anger (6%). CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities to improve perceived appreciation include structured communication of patient gratitude, community building programs, top of licensure initiatives and accountability for physician wellness, and inclusivity efforts from organizational leaders.","Nadkarni, Ashwini; Harry, Elizabeth; Rozenblum, Ronen; Kimberly, Heidi H; Schissel, Scott L; DeOliveira, Maria C; Jackson, Amy B; Giess, Catherine S; Ashley, Stanley W; Dudley, Jessica C",Acad. psychiatry,473,24

This is presumed due to low immunity associated with other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity and metabolic syndrome. But the information available on the immune status of COVID-19 patients is limited. Attempts must be made to enhance our understanding of the immune status of COVID-19 patients by revisiting our knowledge on the immune mechanisms of already known coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Early elevation of the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in SARS and MERS infection suggests a possible same type of cytokine storm-mediated lung damage in COVID-19 patients too. Dysregulation of interferon-1 response and downstream cascade in initial innate immune response at virus entry point has been related to lethal pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Adaptive response of increased CD8+ levels in COVID-19 patients seems to be useful in mild cases where it causes deteriorating effects in progressed severe disease patients resulting in destruction of type 2 pneumocytes hence inability to regenerate the alveolar epithelium. A phenomenon called cytokine storm activates violent immunological reactions in the lung tissue resulting in ARDS followed by multiple organ system damages in COVID-19 patients. Several immune evading mechanisms are thought to be employed by severe respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that might have resulted in its extremely increased contagiousness probably related with its frequent RNA mutations. Failure to develop adequate virus limiting immune reactions by some cured patients warrant monitoring of all recovered patients. This rapid mini review is aimed to enhance our knowledge of the immune status of COVID-19 infected patients with reference to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.","Karikalan, Barani; Darnal, Hari Kumar",J.

As of October 2020, over 44 million confirmed cases and more than 1,160,000 deaths have been reported globally, and the toll is likely to be much higher before the pandemic is over. There are currently little therapeutic options available and new potential targets are intensively investigated. Recently, Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) has emerged as an interesting candidate. Elevated levels of BTK activity have been reported in blood monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, compared to those from healthy volunteers. Importantly, various studies confirmed empirically that administration of BTK inhibitors (Acalabrutinib and Ibrutinib) decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality rate for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Herein, we review the current information regarding the role of BTK in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the suitability of its inhibitors as drugs to treat COVID-19. Implications: The use of BTK inhibitors in the management of COVID-19 shows promise in reducing the severity of the immune response to the infection and thus mortality. However, BTK inhibition may be contributing in other ways to inhibit the effects of the virus and this will need to be carefully studied.","Rada, Miran; Qusairy, Zahraa; Massip-Salcedo, Marta; Macip, Salvador",Mol. cancer res,473,16

Therefore, we designed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using a work-based online influenza surveillance system among primary care workers. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as its findings could apply to other infectious diseases with similar mechanisms of transmission. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the feasibility of using a work-based online influenza surveillance system for primary care workers in Switzerland. METHODS: Physicians and staff of one walk-in clinic and two selected primary care practices were enrolled in this observational prospective pilot study during the 2017-2018 influenza season. They were invited to record symptoms of influenza-like illness in a weekly online survey sent by email and to self-collect a nasopharyngeal swab in case any symptoms were recorded. Samples were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for influenza A, influenza B, and a panel of respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: Among 67 eligible staff members, 58% (n=39) consented to the study and 53% (n=36) provided data. From the time all participants were included, the weekly survey response rate stayed close to 100% until the end of the study. Of 79 symptomatic episodes (mean 2.2 episodes per participant), 10 episodes in 7 participants fitted the definition of an influenza-like illness case (attack rate: 7/36, 19%). One swab tested positive for influenza A H1N1 (attack rate: 3%, 95% CI 0%-18%). Swabbing was considered relatively easy. CONCLUSIONS: A work-based online influenza surveillance system is feasible for use among primary care workers. This promising methodology could be broadly used in future studies to improve the understanding of influenza epidemiology and other diseases such as COVID-19.

The Montreal AI Ethics Institute (MAIEI) reviewed these documents and published a response on 4 June 2020. MAIEI's response examines several questions that touch on the proposed definition of AI; the people-centered nature of the strategy; considerations to ensure that everyone benefits from AI; the strategy's overarching vision; Scotland's AI ecosystem; the proposed strategic themes; and how to grow public confidence in AI by building responsible and ethical systems. In addition to examining the points above, MAIEI suggests that the strategy be extended to include considerations on biometric data and how that will be processed and used in the context of AI. It also highlights the importance of tackling head-on the inherently stochastic nature of deep learning systems and developing concrete guidelines to ensure that these systems are built responsibly and ethically, particularly as machine learning becomes more accessible. Finally, it concludes that any national AI strategy must clearly address the measurements of success in regards to the strategy's stated goals and vision to ensure that they are interpreted and applied consistently. To do this, there must be inclusion and transparency between those building the systems and those using them in their work.","Gupta, Abhishek",,473,16

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 aim to identify previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection Objectives To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or has previously had SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys Search methods We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv In addition, we checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications We did not apply any language restrictions We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020 Selection criteria We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS‐CoV‐2 infection We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS‐CoV‐2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT‐PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria) Data collection and analysis We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS‐2 tool We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots We pooled data using random‐effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post‐symptom onset We tabulated available data by test manufacturer We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) Main results We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1) We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in‐house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability Common issues were use of multi‐group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID‐19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47) Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 infection There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants Two‐thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID‐19 cases based on RT‐PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false‐negative RT‐PCR results We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5) We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post‐symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies) We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that tratified esults by time since symptom onset The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30 1%), rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30 1% (95% CI 21 4 to 40 7) for 1 to 7 days, 72 2% (95% CI 63 5 to 79 5) for 8 to 14 days, 91 4% (95% CI 87 0 to 94 4) for 15 to 21 days Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96 0% (95% CI 90 6 to 98 3) There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post‐symptom onset Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide False‐positive results were more common where COVID‐19 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post‐symptom onset At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high‐risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands Authors' conclusions The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID‐19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT‐PCR tests are negative, or are not done Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post‐symptom onset We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID‐19 disease The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID‐19 tests requires considerable improvement Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms COVID‐19‐positive cases who are RT‐PCR‐negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT‐PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting This is a fast‐moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic review Plain language summary What is the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests for the detection of infection with the COVID‐19 virus? Background COVID‐19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus that spreads ea ily betwee people in a similar way to the common cold or ‘flu Most people with COVID‐19 have a mild to moderate respiratory illness, and some may have no symptoms (asymptomatic infection) Others experience severe symptoms and need specialist treatment and intensive care The immune system of people who have COVID‐19 responds to infection by developing proteins that can attack the virus (antibodies) in their blood Tests to detect antibodies in peoples' blood might show whether they currently have COVID‐19 or have had it previously Why are accurate tests important? Accurate testing allows identification of people who might need treatment, or who need to isolate themselves to prevent the spread of infection Failure to detect people with COVID‐19 when it is present (a false negative result) may delay treatment and risk further spread of infection to others Incorrect identification of COVID‐19 when it is not present (a false positive result) may lead to unnecessary further testing, treatment, and isolation of the person and close contacts Correct identification of people who have previously had COVID‐19 is important in measuring disease spread, assessing the success of public health interventions (like isolation), and potentially in identifying individuals with immunity (should antibodies in the future be shown to indicate immunity) To identify false negative and false positive results, antibody test results are compared in people known to have COVID‐19 and known not to have COVID‐19 Study participants are classified as to whether they are known or not known to have COVID‐19 based on criteria known as the ‘reference standard’ Many studies use samples taken from the nose and throat to identify people with COVID‐19 The samples undergo a testcalled reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) This testing process can sometimes miss infection (false negative result), but additional tests can identify COVID‐19 infection in people with a negative RT‐PCR result These include measuring clinical symptoms, like coughing or high temperature, or ‘imaging’ tests like chest X‐rays People known not to have COVID‐19 are sometimes identified from stored blood samples taken before COVID‐19 existed, or from patients with respiratory symptoms found to be caused by other diseases What did the review study? The studies looked at three types of antibody, IgA, IgG and IgM Most tests measure both IgG and IgM, but some measure a single antibody or combinations of the three antibodies Levels of antibodies rise and fall at different times after infection IgG is the last to rise but lasts longest Levels of antibodies are usually highest a few weeks after infection Some antibody tests need specialist laboratory equipment Others use disposable devices, similar to pregnancy tests These tests can be used in laboratories or wherever the patient is (point‐of‐care), in hospital or at home We wanted to find out whether antibody tests: ‐ are accurate enough to diagnose infection in people with or without symptoms of COVID‐19, and ‐ can be used to find out if someone has already had COVID‐19 What did we do? We looked for studies that measured the accuracy of antibody tests compared with reference standard criteria to detect current or past COVID‐19 infection Studies could assess any antibody test compared with any reference standard People could be tested in hospital or the community Studies could test people known to have – or not to have – or be suspected of having COVID‐19 Study characteristics We found 54 relevant studies Studies took place in Asia (38), Europe (15), and in both USA and China (1) Forty‐six studies included people who were in hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 infection only Twenty‐nine studies compared test results in people with COVID‐19 with test results in healthy people or people with other diseases Not all studies provided details about participants’ age and gender Often, we could not tell whether studies were valuating c rrent or past infection, as few reported whether participants were recovering We did not find any studies that tested only asymptomatic people Main results Our findings come mainly from 38 studies that provided results based on the time since people first noticed symptoms Antibody tests one week after first symptoms only detected 30% of people who had COVID‐19 Accuracy increased in week 2 with 70% detected, and was highest in week 3 (more than 90% detected) Little evidence was available after week 3 Tests gave false positive results in 2% of those without COVID‐19 Results from IgG/IgM tests three weeks after symptoms started suggested that if 1000 people had antibody tests, and 50 (5%) of them really had COVID‐19 (as we might expect in a national screening survey): ‐ 58 people would test positive for COVID‐19 Of these, 12 people (21%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result) ‐ 942 people would test negative for COVID‐19 Of these, 4 people (0 4%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result) If we tested 1000 healthcare workers (in a high‐risk setting) who had had symptoms, and 500 (50%) of them really had COVID‐19: ‐ 464 people would test positive for COVID‐19 Of these, 7 people (2%) would not have COVID‐19 (false positive result) ‐ 537 people would test negative for COVID‐19 Of these, 43 (8%) would actually have COVID‐19 (false negative result) We did not find convincing differences in accuracy for different types of antibody test How reliable were the results of the studies of this review? Our confidence in the evidence is limited for several reasons In general, studies were small, did not use the most reliable methods and did not report their results fully Often, they did not include patients with COVID‐19 who may have had a false negative result on PCR, and took their data for people without COVID‐19 from records of tests done before COVID‐19 arose This may have affected test accuracy, but it is impossible to identify by how much Who do the results of this review apply to? Most participants were in hospital with COVID‐19, so were likely to have more severe disease than people with mild symptoms who were not hospitalised This means that we don't know how accurate antibody tests are for people with milder disease or no symptoms More than half of the studies assessed tests they had developed themselves, most of which are not available to buy Many studies were published quickly online as ‘preprints’ Preprints do not undergo the normal rigorous checks of published studies, so we are not certain how reliable they are As most studies took place in Asia, we don't know whether test results would be similar elsewhere in the world What are the implications of this review? The review shows that antibody tests could have a useful role in detecting if someone has had COVID‐19, but the timing of when the tests are used is important Antibody tests may help to confirm COVID‐19 infection in people who have had symptoms for more than two weeks and do not have a RT‐PCR test, or have negative RT‐PCR test results The tests are better at detecting COVID‐19 in people two or more weeks after their symptoms started, but we do not know how well they work more than five weeks after symptoms started We do not know how well the tests work for people who have milder disease or no symptoms, because the studies in the review were mainly done in people who were in hospital In time, we will learn whether having previously had COVID‐19 provides individuals with immunity to future infection Further research is needed into the use of antibody tests in people recovering from COVID‐19 infection, and in people who have experienced mild symptoms or who never experienced symptoms How up‐to‐date is this review? This review includes evidence published up to 27 April 2020 Because a lot of new research is being published in this field, we will update this review frequently","Deeks, J.

In patients with known malignancies, in addition to constraints in routine healthcare, the risk of being susceptible to developing severe forms of the disease is of grave concern. While follow-up studies on survivors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2003 outbreak revealed increased susceptibility to infections, tumours and cardiovascular abnormalities, recent studies implicating angiopoietin 2 in induction of inflammatory intussusceptive angiogenesis and diffuse alveolar damage in COVID-19 patients raises the possibility of progression of carcinogenetic processes in patients with known malignancies. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) mediated cellular entry of SARS-Cov2 leads to receptor shedding of ACE-2 and disrupts the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis (RAAS). This augments the pro-inflammatory and proliferative effects of RAAS, while attenuating the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative angiotensin 1-7 /Mas pathway. Angiopoietin-2, a molecule responsible for angiogenesis and cancer progression which corelates with tumour load in certain cancers, is upregulated by angiotensin 2-AT1 Receptor axis. Tumour microenvironment-comprising of various cells, blood vessels and extra cellular matrix which express the RAAS peptides-plays a key role in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. Angiotensin 2 induces the formation of a desmoplastic environment, favouring cancer cell growth. ACE-2 downregulation causes bradykinin accumulation which may exert its proliferative action via mitogen activated protein kinase pathways which has established roles in cancers of breast and kidney. In addition to cytokine storm causing organ damage, acute inflammation in COVID-19 may also cause epithelial mesenchymal transition and heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation, both of which are key mediators in cancer signalling pathways. We hypothesise that SARS-Cov2, by impacting the RAAS and immune system, has the potential to cause tumour cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion and metastasis, thereby increasing the possibility of cancer progression in patients with known malignancies.","Saha, Aritra; Anirvan, Prajna",Ecancermedicalscience,473,26

At least three major prototypic VoC have been identified, i.e. the United Kingdom, UK (B.1.1.7), South African (B.1.351) and Brazilian (B.1.1.28.1) variants. These are replacing formerly dominant strains and sparking new COVID-19 epidemics. METHODS: We studied the effect of infection with prototypic VoC from both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in female Syrian golden hamsters to assess their relative infectivity and virulence in direct comparison to two basal SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in early 2020. FINDINGS: A very efficient infection of the lower respiratory tract of hamsters by these VoC is observed. In line with clinical evidence from patients infected with these VoC, no major differences in disease outcome were observed as compared to the original strains as was quantified by (i) histological scoring, (ii) micro-computed tomography, and (iii) analysis of the expression profiles of selected antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Noteworthy however, in hamsters infected with VoC B.1.1.7, a particularly strong elevation of proinflammatory cytokines was detected. INTERPRETATION: We established relevant preclinical infection models that will be pivotal to assess the efficacy of current and future vaccine(s) (candidates) as well as therapeutics (small molecules and antibodies) against two important SARS-CoV-2 VoC.

In this work, an Eulerian-Lagrangian computational fluid dynamics model is used based on a voxel-based (GeoDict) and a mesh-based (StarCCM+) code. For evaluating accuracy and computational time of both models, fractional filtration efficiency and pressure drop are compared to an empirical solution for a single fiber and to experimental results for a complex 3D fibrous filter material. Simulation results of both methods are in good agreement with empirical and measurement results although the complex geometry of the fibers is captured more accurately by the unstructured mesh using the same resolution.

These include chronic neurological conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and acute respiratory infections such as that caused by COVID-19. The capsules were fabricated by concentrically dripping oil/alginate droplets, from a coaxial nozzle, into an oppositely charged ionic liquid. This fabrication technique enables full control over the capsule size, the shell thickness and the volume of the encapsulated oil. After formation, liquid capsules were left to dry and form a solid crust surrounding the oil. The prototype test consists of placing a standardized number of capsules between adhesive strips that users crush and pull apart to release the smell. In addition to the fabrication method, a simple mathematical model was developed to predict the volume of encapsulated oil within the capsule in terms of the flow rate ratio and the nozzle size. Tensile tests show that capsule strength is inversely proportional to its size owing to an increase in the shell thickness. By increasing the alginate concentration, the load required to rupture the capsule increases, to the point where capsules are too stiff to be broken by a fingertip grip. Results from a preliminary screening test, within a group of patients with Parkinson's disease, found that smells were detectable using a 'forced choice' paradigm.","Ismail, A Said; Goodwin, Gregory R; Castrejon-Pita, J Rafael; Noyce, Alastair J; Azevedo, Helena S",J R Soc Interface,473,1

RECENT FINDINGS: Headache, dizziness, excessive tiredness, myalgia, anosmia/hyposmia, and ageusia/dysgeusia are common nonspecific neurological manifestations during early COVID-19 disease found in the majority of patients. Less frequent but more severe and specific neurological manifestations include Guillain--Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis/meningitis, epileptic seizures, and cerebrovascular events. Beyond standard neurological examination, these require a more extensive work-up, including cerebrospinal fluid assessment, neurophysiological evaluation, neuroimaging, and cognitive testing. Symptomatic treatment is advisable unless the neurological complication's immune pathogenesis is proven. SUMMARY: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 occur during the acute, para-infectious, and 'recovery' phase. Therapeutic management depends on the clinical presentation and neurological work-up.","Schweitzer, Finja; Kleineberg, Nina N; Göreci, Yasemin; Onur, Oezguer A; Franke, Christiana; Warnke, Clemens",Curr Opin Neurol,473,16

The Radiotherapy Department has been divided into a clean zone and a semi-contaminated zone, and corresponding personal protective equipment is used in these zones. The temperature of patients and their escorts, and history of fever are assessed daily. Special procedures are performed during radiotherapy setup and intracavitary brachytherapy. RESULTS: Over a period of 2 months, 655 patients were treated in the Department. Sixteen patients with fever were identified and no patient undergoing radiotherapy or medical staff have been infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our protective measures were found to be effective and can be used as a reference in places where COVID-19 situations are not markedly serious.","Wang, Weiping; Liu, Xiaoliang; Zhang, Fuquan; Qiu, Jie; Hu, K E",In Vivo,473,16

The oncogenic phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway is a classic dysregulated pathway involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. However, the underlying mechanism for how PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway aberrantly activates HCC has not been entirely elucidated. The recognition of the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis sheds light on a new dimension to our understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis. In this review, we comprehensively summarize 67 dysregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related lncRNAs in HCC. Many studies have indicated that the 67 dysregulated lncRNAs show oncogenic or anti-oncogenic effects in HCC by regulation on epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and they play pivotal roles in the initiation of HCC in diverse biological processes like proliferation, metastasis, drug resistance, radio-resistance, energy metabolism, autophagy and so on. Besides, many of these lncRNAs are associated with clinicopathological features and clinical prognosis in HCC, which may provide a potential future application in the diagnosis and therapy of HCC.","Wu, Yuting; Zhang, Yingshi; Qin, Xiaochun; Geng, Haobin; Zuo, Daiying; Zhao, Qingchun",Pharmacol Res,473,24

Imaging studies revealed splenic infarcts and ground-glass opacities in bilateral pulmonary bases. He was treated with full-dose anticoagulation and was discharged home on oral Rivaroxaban. Discussion: Although rare in the literature, cases of acute abdomen in COVID-19 patients associated with vascular infarctions have increased. Coagulopathy may be present even without clinical respiratory manifestations of the disease. Patients meeting disseminated intravascular coagulation criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant therapy.

Lung macrophages are important in mounting an inflammatory response to injury, but they are also involved in repair of injury. Macrophages develop mixed phenotypes in complex pathological conditions and polarize to a predominant phenotype depending on the duration and stage of injury and/or repair. Little is known about the reprogramming required for lung macrophages to switch between these divergent functions; therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) by which macrophages promote metabolic reprogramming to regulate lung injury is essential. Here, we show that lung macrophages polarize to a pro-inflammatory, classically activated phenotype after cadmium-mediated lung injury. Since metabolic adaptation provides energy for the diverse macrophage functions, these classically activated macrophages show metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and transcription factors regulating glycolytic flux in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice. Moreover, cadmium exposure promoted increased macrophage glycolytic function with enhanced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), glycolytic metabolites, and lactate excretion. These observations suggest that cadmium mediates the persistence of classically activated lung macrophages to exacerbate lung injury.","Larson-Casey, Jennifer L; Gu, Linlin; Fiehn, Oliver; Carter, A Brent",J. biol. chem,473,1

It is supported by the presence of the horseshoe bat suspected to be the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 and by the scarcity of pork, due to African swine fever, diverting consumers to exotic animals of breeding sold in the markets. During this pandemic, several animal species were affected by SARS-CoV-2. Sporadic cases were first reported in pets (dogs and cats) infected by their owners, then in large feline species and apes infected in zoos by their nurses. The most significant human-to-animal transmission has occurred in mink farms, especially in the Netherlands and Denmark, requiring the euthanasia of several million animals, with mink in turn having contaminated men and stray or nomadic cats. The study of natural or experimental transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 has made it possible to identify the most receptive animal species: American minks and raccoon dogs, and to a lesser extent stray or nomadic cats, which could become an animal reservoir due to their sensitivity to this virus and their extending prolificacy. The European Commission decided on May 17, 2021 to strengthen the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in minks and other mustelids, as well as in raccoon dogs, highlighting stressing that the epidemiological assessment of the risk presented by the he appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in these susceptible species was a public health priority.","Brugère-Picoux, J; Leroy, E; Rosolen, S; Angot, J-L; Buisson, Y",Bull. acad. natl. med,473,30

Some conflicts have emerged regarding the confrontation between adherence to hygienic measures and the performance of religious ceremonies, especially visit of Imam Reza shrine as the most important religious site in Iran. It seems that these conflicts have not been solved yet and are still at play. This survey study employs a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach to investigate pilgrims' justifications for making a pilgrimage to visit the shrine of Imam Reza during the spread of Coronavirus by means of content analysis. To this end, during the survey phase, 936 questionnaires were completed by the respondents and, in the qualitative phase, 46 pilgrims visiting the shrine of Imam Reza were interviewed in order to study the reasons for their presence in the shrine under such unique circumstances and analyze their justifications regarding their pilgrimage method in the shrine. The findings of the survey revealed that some pilgrims deemed the shrine to be so sacred that, basically, they would consider it free of any kind of disease. In contrast, the other pilgrims, while attesting that the virus can exist in the shrine, believed that it is possible to engage in pilgrimage as long as the required hygienic measures are observed. The findings of the qualitative phase revealed that pilgrims' justifications (rationalities for pilgrimage) can be categorized into four classes: tradition-devotion, repudiation-mitigation, obligation-imitation, and rational methods. What differentiates these four methods is the degree of attention paid to the earthly matter, (i.e., the disease) and the extent to which it is taken seriously.","Fouladiyan, M.; Sadrnabavi, F.; Mousavi, M.

This is a retrospective study of the HOPE-COVID-19 registry, with data collected from January 1th through April 31th, 2020. We selected all hospitalized adult patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-COV2 pneumonia and a registered admission serum sodium level (SNa). Patients were classified as hyponatremic (SNa <135 mmol/L), eunatremic (SNa 135-145 mmol/L), or hypernatremic (SNa >145 mmol/L). Multivariable analyses were performed to elucidate independent relationships of admission hyponatremia and hypernatremia, with mortality, sepsis, or IT during hospitalization. Four thousand six hundred sixty-four patients were analyzed, median age 66 (52-77), 58% males. Death occurred in 988 (21.2%) patients, sepsis was diagnosed in 551 (12%) and IT in 838 (18.4%).

We chose to quantify the impact in the radiation oncology department of the largest academic center in the hardest hit city in Canada. With the approval of our ethics review board, data on each patient treated from March 13, 2020 to August 10, 2020 were compared to patients treated during the same period in 2019. We compared the case mix, delay from treatment decision to treatment start, and number of fractions per patient. We reviewed prospectively collected information regarding deviations from our usual practice. During the pandemic the caseload was reduced by 12%; this was more pronounced in prostate and CNS tumors. The average number of fractions per patient was reduced from 12.3 to 10.9. This reduction was most marked in prostate, breast, gastro-intestinal, and palliative cases. When physicians were questioned, they reported that 17% of treatment plans deviated from their usual practice because of the pandemic. The most common deviations were related to changes in department policies (77%) vs. patient-specific deviations (20%) or changes requested by the patient (3%). Rare deviations were due to patients contracting COVID-19 (2 patients). At its worse, the wait list contained 27% of patients who had a delay to radiotherapy of more than 28 days. However, the average wait time increased little (19.6 days vs. 18.2 days) as more pressing cases were prioritized. In an unprecedented health crisis, our radiation oncology department was able to reduce resource utilization, notably by decreasing the number of fractions per patient. It will be important to follow these patients' health outcomes for insight into these practices. More quantitative tools to simulate and plan future practice changes in response to resource constraints will be implemented.","Roberge, David; Delouya, Guila; Bohigas, Alexandra; Michalowski, Stefan",Curr Oncol,473,1

The aim of our study was to assess the potential impact of COVID-19 on the stage of colorectal cancer. Methods: In our retrospective study, two groups of patients operated for colorectal cancer were analyzed at the Clinic for Surgery ""Nikola Spasic"", Zvezdara University Medical Center. The study group consisted of 49 patients operated in the period from March 15, 2020 to April 2021, during COVID-19 pandemic. The control group consisted of 152 patients, who were operated on in the period from January 1, 2019. to December 31, 2019. Results: There were no difference in surgical approach, prevalence of stoma, percentages of postoperative complications and rates of hospital readmission between both groups. T4b tumor stage was statistically significant more common in the study group (12.2% vs 3.3%, p=0.027). Locally advanced tumors, stage IIC, were statistically significantly more common in the group of patients operated on during the COVID-19 pandemic (10.2% vs 1.3%, p=0.01). Conclusion: Higher number of locally advanced tumors in study group could probably be caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare system.","Radulovic, Radosav S; Cuk, Vladica V; Juloski, Jovan T; Arbutina, Dragana D; Krdzic, Igor D; Milic, Ljiljana V; Kenic, Marko V; Karamarkovic, Aleksandar R",Chirurgia (Bucur),473,12

Tourism has been one the most affected economic sectors because of the mobility restrictions established by governments and uncoordinated actions from origin and destination regions. The coordination of restrictions and reopening policies could help control the spread of virus and enhance economies, but this is not an easy endeavor since touristic companies, citizens, and local governments have conflicting interests. We propose an evolutionary game model that reflects a collective risk dilemma behind these decisions. To this aim, we represent regions as players, organized in groups; and consider the perceived risk as a strict lock-down and null economic activity. The costs for regions when restricting their mobility are heterogeneous, given that the dependence on tourism of each region is diverse. Our analysis shows that, for both large populations and the EU NUTS2 case study, the existence of heterogeneous costs enhances global agreements. Furthermore, the decision on how to group regions to maximize the regions' agreement of the population is a relevant issue for decision makers to consider. We find out that a layout of groups based on similar costs of cooperation boosts the regions' agreements and avoid the risk of having a total lock-down and a negligible tourism activity. These findings can guide policy makers to facilitate agreements among regions to maximize the tourism recovery.","Chica, Manuel; Hernández, Juan M; Bulchand-Gidumal, Jacques",Sci Rep,473,16

The Impact of Preschool Closure on Mothers' Psychological Distress: Evidence from the First COVID-19 Outbreak (preprint),18.44499,4.847354,2020,"PURPOSE: Although the year after cancer treatment is challenging for all cancer survivors, older adults (&#8805;60 years) face additional challenges due to age-related decline and high rates of comorbidity. There is a paucity of research on how health service interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the experience of older cancer survivors. In this study we explore older cancer survivors' reflections on the pandemic and their suggestions for future care delivery when traditionally offered resources are not available. METHODS: We conducted 1:1 telephone interviews with adults 60 years and older previously diagnosed with breast and colorectal cancer and recently (&#8804;12 months) discharged from their cancer care team. We analyzed the data using descriptive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The mean sample (n = 30) age was 72.1 years (SD 5.8, Range 63-83) of whom 57% identified as female. Participants described personal and societal implications of the pandemic. that affected their ability to navigate social support, and public and clinical landscapes. These reflections informed their suggestions for future health care delivery, such as how they could have been better prepared to self-manage their post-cancer treatment journey. Participants recommendations were grouped into four sub-themes: 1) enhanced baseline information; 2) facilitate caregiver support and engagement; 3) greater technology integration; and 4) sustained use and public appreciation of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Older cancer survivors appreciate the needed shift to virtual appointments and services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific strategies to bolster older adults existing strengths and improve their readiness to engage in these measures are critical.","Haase, Kristen R; Kain, Danielle; Merchant, Shaila; Booth, Christopher; Koven, Rachel; Brundage, Michael; Galica, Jacqueline",Journal of geriatric oncology,473,12

It is clear that opening of the schools will cause more COVID-19 casualties, but the key question is how many students should attend the schools daily while keeping the casualties under control. In this paper, an artificial intelligence based long-term policy making algorithm has been developed to generate time varying policies for opening of the schools part-by-part. The key aim of the algorithm is to produce policies which maximize the number of the students attending the schools while minimizing the pandemic casualties under the worst-case uncertainties. The proposed algorithm consists of a multi-input-multi-output, uncertain, and adaptive background parametric model which is externally manipulated by the produced adaptive policy. Its long-term predictor assesses the possible future casualties under the current policy and its policy maker generates alternative solutions that minimize the future casualties. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm is able to generate effective policies which minimize the COVID-19 casualties while maximize the number of the students attending the schools under the worst-case uncertainties.","Tutsoy, O.",Ieee Access,473,21

The aim was to create capacities for the in-hospital care of the patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to check whether a reduction in the number of trauma patients compared to the mean of the previous 3 years could be observed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who presented in the emergency admission from 1 March to 15 April 2020 with the mean of the patients from the previous 3 years 2017-2019. The age of the patients, time of presentation, diagnoses, whereabouts of the patients, inpatient or outpatient, number and duration of the operative care and required capacity on the normal ward and intensive care units (ICU) were recorded. The injury mechanism was also examined. RESULTS: A total of 4967 patients between 1 March and 15 April were included. On average over the 3 previous years, a total of 1348 patients, i.e. 29.3 patients per day were counted in our emergency room. In 2020 a total of 923, i.e. 20 patients per day (pâ¯< 0.01) were counted. On average 227 (24.6%) were admitted to hospital compared to 311.5 (23.1%) in 2020.

When COVID-19 closed schools and businesses and restricted social gatherings, parks became one of the few places that urban residents were permitted to visit outside their homes. With a focus on Philadelphia, PA and New York City, NY, this paper presents a snapshot of the park usage during the early phases of the pandemic. Forty-three Civic Scientists were employed by the research team to observe usage in 22 different parks selected to represent low and high social vulnerability, and low, medium, and high population density. Despite speculation that parks could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, no strong correlation was found between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in adjacent zip codes and the number of park users. High social vulnerability neighborhoods were associated with a significantly higher number of COVID-19 cases (p&lt;0.01). In addition, no significant difference in the number of park users was detected between parks in high and low vulnerability neighborhoods. The number of park users did significantly increase with population density in both cities (p&lt;0.01), though usage varied greatly by park. Males were more frequently observed than females in parks in both high vulnerability and high-density neighborhoods. Although high vulnerability neighborhoods reported higher COVID-19 cases, residents of Philadelphia and New York City appear to have been undeterred from visiting parks during this phase of the pandemic. This snapshot study provides no evidence to support closing parks during the pandemic. To the contrary, people continued to visit parks throughout the study, underscoring their evident value as respite for urban residents during the early phases of the pandemic.","Alizadehtazi, Bita Tangtrakul Korin Woerdeman Sloane Gussenhoven Anna Mostafavi Nariman Montalto Franco A.",Journal of Extreme Events,473,24

However, the RT-qPCR assay has limitations in terms of sensitivity and quantification. In this study, we tested both qPCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect low amounts of viral RNA. The cycle threshold (CT) of the viral RNA by RT-PCR significantly varied according to the sequences of the primer and probe sets with in vitro transcript (IVT) RNA or viral RNA as templates, whereas the copy number of the viral RNA by ddPCR was effectively quantified with IVT RNA, cultured viral RNA, and RNA from clinical samples. Furthermore, the clinical samples were assayed via both methods, and the sensitivity of the ddPCR was determined to be equal to or more than that of the RT-qPCR. However, the ddPCR assay is more suitable for determining the copy number of reference materials.

METHODS: As the COVID-19 pandemic started and peaked in New York, almost all of our scheduled urologic surgeries were cancelled. Each Urologist was asked to rank his/her cancelled surgeries by priority (Level 1-least urgent; Level 2-moderately urgent; Level 3-most urgent). A committee of Urologists assigned a subclass to Level 3 and 2 cases (3a-least urgent; 3b-moderately urgent; 3c-most urgent; 2a-lower priority; 2b-higher priority). The committee then reviewed cases by urgency to derive a final priority ranking. RESULTS: A total of 478 total urologic surgeries were canceled and categorized: 250 Level 1, 130 Level 2, 98 Level 3 (73 adult, 25 pediatric). Level 3c involved renal cell carcinoma &#8805; T2b, high-grade bladder urothelial carcinoma, adrenal mass/cancer > 6 cm, testicular cancer requiring radical orchiectomy, and penile cancer. Level 3b involved T2a renal masses requiring nephrectomy, while high-risk prostate cancer and symptomatic nephrolithiasis were classified as 3a. Level 2 included testicular cancer requiring retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and complicated benign prostatic hyperplasia. Surgeries for urologic reconstruction, non-complicated nephrolithiasis, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence were considered Level 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our disease-specific approach to surgical rescheduling offers appropriate guidance for triaging urologic surgeries. Our system can provide guidance to other institutions as COVID-19 cases surge in different regions and with the growing second wave.","Aboumohamed, Ahmed; Gottlieb, Josh; DeMasi, Matthew; Barry, Emily; Sankin, Alexander; Watts, Kara",BMC Surg,473,1

A popular hypothesis states that the so-called infodemic has a substantial impact on orienting individual decisions. A competing hypothesis stresses that exposure to vast amounts of even contradictory information has little effect on personal choices. The COVID-19 pandemic offered an opportunity to investigate this relationship, analysing the interplay between COVID-19 related information circulation and the propensity of users to get vaccinated. We analyse the vaccine infodemics on Twitter and Facebook by looking at 146M contents produced by 20M accounts between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2021. We find that vaccine-related news triggered huge interest through social media, affecting attention patterns and the modality in which information was spreading. However, we observe that such a tumultuous information landscape translated only in minimal variations in overall vaccine acceptance as measured by Facebook's daily COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (previously known as COVID-19 World Symptoms Survey) on a sample of 1.6M users. Notably, the observation period includes the European Medicines Agency (EMA) investigations over blood clots cases potentially related to vaccinations, a series of events that could have eroded trust in vaccination campaigns. We conclude the paper by investigating the numerical correlation between various infodemics indices and vaccine acceptance, observing strong compatibility with a null model. This finding supports the hypothesis that altered information consumption patterns are not a reliable predictor of collective behavioural change. Instead, wider attention on social media seems to resolve in polarisation, with the vaccine-prone and the vaccine-hesitant maintaining their positions.","Valensise, Carlo M.; Cinelli, Matteo; Nadini, Matthieu; Galeazzi, Alessandro; Peruzzi, Antonio; Etta, Gabriele; Zollo, Fabiana; Baronchelli, Andrea; Quattrociocchi, Walter",,473,23

(Research Theme: COVID-19 pandemic.),18.449387,3.5634787,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Our study describes changes in HIV care service delivery and continuity of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) during the 8 weeks before and after diagnosis of the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Haiti on March 19, 2020. METHODS: Using data from 96 out of 167 health facilities offering ART services, we compared four ART program indicators: (1) count of HIV visits; (2) proportion of ART dispenses in community-based settings (DAC); (3) proportion of multi-month dispensing of ART medications > 6 months (> 6 m MMD); and (4) proportion of timely ART refills. We used uncontrolled interrupted time series (ITS) models to estimate slope and level changes in each indicator with the arrival of COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From week 1 to week 16, the average number of HIV visits fell from 121.5 to 92.5 visits, the proportion of DAC rose from 22.7% to 36.7%, the proportion of > 6 m MMD rose from 29.4% to 48.4%, and the proportion of timely ART refills fell from 51.9% to 43.8%. The ITS models estimated abrupt increases of 36% in > 6 m MMD (p < 0.001) and 37% in DAC (p < 0.001) at the time of COVID-19 arrival, and no change after arrival of COVID-19. The was an abrupt decline of 18% in timely ART refills with the arrival of COVID-19 and a decline of 1% per week thereafter, both non-statistically significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: The sudden changes in HIV service utilization represent dramatic adaptations needed to mitigate primary and secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PLHIV. This study underscores the urgency of optimizing ART delivery models in Haiti and beyond, in order to maintain progress toward HIV epidemic control.","Celestin, Kemar; Allorant, Adrien; Virgin, Michelle; Marinho, Elisma; Francois, Kesner; Honoré, Jean Guy; White, Christina; Valles, Jean Solon; Perrin, Georges; De Kerorguen, Nicolas; Flowers, Jan; Balan, Jean Gabriel; Koama, Jean Baptiste T; Barnhart, Scott; Puttkammer, Nancy",AIDS behav,473,12

Material and Methods: An online survey was sent to gynecologic oncology specialists and fellows in Turkey. It included management questions about strategies for newly diagnosed or recurrent endometrial, cervical, ovarian and vulvar cancer during the pandemic. Participants were asked if treatment of these cancers can be delayed or not and, if yes, the duration of delay. Results: 32.9% of surgeons prescribed oral or intrauterine progesterone for early stage, low-grade endometrial cancer. Conversely, 65.7% and 45.7% of the most surgeons did not change their management for early stage high-grade and advanced stage endometrial cancers respectively, as they perform surgery. 58% and 67.1% of the surgeons continued to prefer standard surgical treatment for microinvasive and early stage cervical cancers, respectively. Radiotherapy was preferred administered with hypofractionated doses for locally advanced cervical cancer (57.1%). While 67.1% of surgeons operated early stage ovarian cancer patients, 50% administered neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to all advanced stage ovarian cancers and 50% administered more cycles of NACT in preference to interval debulking surgery. 93.7% of the surgeons responded that treatment should not be delayed beyond eight weeks. Conclusion: Most Turkish gynecologic oncologists modified their management of gynecologic cancers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While chemotherapy was preferred for ovarian cancer, postponement of the surgery, with or without non-surgical options, was considered for early stage, low-grade endometrial cancer. Treatment of gynecologic cancers should be decided on a case by case basis, taking into account local COVID-19 infection rates and availability of health facilities. Prognosis is also an important consideration if delay is contemplated. Standard treatment and normal time-frames should be used if possible. If not, a postponement for a maximum of eight weeks or referral to another center were acceptable alternatives.","Altin, Duygu; Yalçin, Ibrahim; Khatib, Ghanim; Daggez Kelesoglu, Mine; Akgöl, Sedat; Önder, Ayse Büsra; Kahramanoglu, Ilker; Güvenal, Tevfik; Topuz, Samet; Demirkiran, Fuat",J Turk Ger Gynecol Assoc,473,21

We aimed to critically appraise and synthesise published evidence on the risk factors for poor outcomes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, medRxiv and the WHO COVID-19 literature database for studies that reported characteristics of COVID-19 patients who required hospitalisation. We included studies published between January and May 2020 that reported adjusted effect size of any demographic and/or clinical factors for any of the three poor outcomes: mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation. We appraised the quality of the included studies using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools and quantitatively synthesised the evidence through a series of random-effect meta-analyses. To aid data interpretation, we further developed an interpretation framework that indicated strength of the evidence, informed by both quantity and quality of the evidence. Results: We included a total of 40 studies in our review. Most of the included studies (29/40, 73%) were assessed as ""good quality"", with assessment scores of 80 or more. We found that male sex (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-1.48; 20 studies), older age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07, per one year of age increase; 10 studies), obesity (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.02-2.48; 4 studies), diabetes (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.40; 11 studies) and chronic kidney diseases (6 studies; OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.27-1.93) were associated with increased risks for mortality with the greatest strength of evidence based on our interpretation framework. We did not find increased risk of mortality for several factors including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (5 studies), cancer (4 studies), or current smoker (5 studies); however, this does not indicate absence of risk due to limited data on each of these factors. Conclusion: Male sex, older age, obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases are important risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes. Our review provides not only an appraisal and synthesis of evidence on the risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes, but also a data interpretation framework that could be adopted by relevant future research.","Li, You; Ashcroft, Thulani; Chung, Alexandria; Dighero, Izzie; Dozier, Marshall; Horne, Margaret; McSwiggan, Emilie; Shamsuddin, Azwa; Nair, Harish",J Glob Health,473,21

This study aimed to evaluate the preparedness for the pandemic among a European network of children's hospitals and to explore the strategies to restart health care services. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed in May 2020 to the 13 children's tertiary care hospitals belonging to the European Children's Hospitals Organisation. Responses were obtained from eight hospitals (62%). Significant reductions were observed in accesses to the emergency departments (41.7%), outpatient visits (35.7%), intensive and non-intensive care unit inpatient admissions (16.4 and 13%, respectively) between February 1 and April 30, 2020 as compared with the same period of 2019. Overall, 93 children with SARS CoV-2 infection were admitted to inpatient wards. All the hospitals created SARS-CoV-2 preparedness plans for the diagnosis and management of infected patients. Routine activities were re-scheduled. Four hospitals shared their own staff with adult units, two designated bed spaces for adults and only one admitted adults to inpatient wards. The three main components for the resumption of clinical activities were testing, source control, and reorganization of spaces and flows. Telemedicine and telehealth services were used before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by three hospitals and by all the hospitals during it. Conclusion: The present study provides a perspective on preparedness to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among eight large European children's hospitals, on the impact of the pandemic on the hospital activities and on the strategies adopted to restart clinical activities.","Indolfi, Giuseppe; Stivala, Micol; Lenge, Matteo; Diaz Naderi, Ruben; McIntosh, Jennifer; Llandrich, Ricard Casadevall; Gannon, Joe; McGreevy, Kathleen S; Trapani, Sandra; Miettinen, Päivi; Lahdenne, Pekka; Desborough, Louisa; Pavare, Jana; van Rossum, Annemarie; Zyska, Dagmara; Resti, Massimo; Zanobini, Alberto",Front Public Health,473,26

Although China and Iran are developing countries based on the World Bank’s criteria, these two countries are different in access to resources and health care systems. We hypothesized that Iranians would show higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress as compared to Chinese. Methods: This study collected information related to the COVID-19 pandemic including physical health, precautionary measures and knowledge about the pandemic. We also used validated questionnaires such as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess the mental health status. Results: There were a total of 1411 respondents (550 from Iran;861 from China). The mean IES-R scores of respondents from both countries were above the cut-off for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Iranians had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression (p &lt; 0.01). Significantly more Iranians believed COVID-19 was transmitted via contact, practised hand hygiene, were unsatisfied with health information and expressed less confidence in their doctors, but were less likely to wear a facemask (p &lt; 0.001). Significantly more Iranians received health information related to COVID-19 via television while Chinese preferred the Internet (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: This cross-country study found that Iranians had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression as compared to Chinese. The difference in reported measures between respondents from Iran and China were due to differences in access to healthcare services and governments’ responses to the pandemic.","Wang, Cuiyan Fardin Mohammad A.; Shirazi, Mahmoud Pan Riyu Wan Xiaoyang Tan Yilin Xu Linkang McIntyre Roger S.; Bach, Tran Quek Travis T.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 15 April 2020, together with the German Society of Pathology and the Federal Association of German Pathologists, the German Registry of COVID-19 Autopsies (DeRegCOVID) was launched ( www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de ). Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary cooperation in the field of autopsies in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic is impressively demonstrated by the establishment of DeRegCOVID, the merger of the registry of neuropathology (CNS-COVID19) with DeRegCOVID and the establishment of the autopsy network DEFEAT PANDEMIcs. It gives a strong signal for the necessity, readiness, and expertise to jointly help manage current and future pandemics by autopsy-derived knowledge.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Acker, Till; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Baretton, Gustavo; Bülow, Roman David; Bürrig, Karl-Friedrich; Holtherm, Hans-Ulrich; Jonigk, Danny; Knüchel, Ruth; Majeed, Raphael W; Röhrig, Rainer; Wienströer, Jan; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,473,16

To examine the full-spectrum of CD8+ T cell immunity in COVID-19, we experimentally evaluated 3141 major histocompatibility (MHC) class I-binding peptides covering the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome. Using DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) multimers combined with a T cell phenotype panel, we report a comprehensive list of 122 immunogenic and a subset of immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. Substantial CD8+ T cell recognition was observed in COVID-19 patients, with up to 27% of all CD8+ lymphocytes interacting with SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes. Most immunogenic regions were derived from open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF3, with ORF1 containing most of the immunodominant epitopes. CD8+ T cell recognition of lower affinity was also observed in healthy donors toward SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes. This pre-existing T cell recognition signature was partially overlapping with the epitope landscape observed in COVID-19 patients and may drive the further expansion of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly the phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, revealed a strong T cell activation in COVID-19 patients, while minimal T cell activation was seen in healthy individuals. We found that patients with severe disease displayed significantly larger SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell populations compared to patients with mild diseases and these T cells displayed a robust activation profile. These results further our understanding of T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypothesize that strong antigen-specific T cell responses are associated with different disease outcomes.","Saini, Sunil Kumar; Hersby, Ditte Stampe; Tamhane, Tripti; Povlsen, Helle Rus; Amaya Hernandez, Susana Patricia; Nielsen, Morten; Gang, Anne Ortved; Hadrup, Sine Reker",Sci. immunol,473,1

COVID-19 directly invades lungs, it also involves the nervous system. However, it is too early to know whether COVID-19 will have long-term impacts on patients with neurologic disease. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed people's daily routines, and it all happened in a short period. Neurologists are affected negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic in a few key ways, including: a reduced ability on admission or transfer of critically ill neurologic patients. During these exceptional times, a huge need arose for neurologists in the frontline and expected to be aware of and conscious for diagnosing neurological complications of COVID-19. In this process, the use of telemedicine (teleneurology) in the field of neurology is a significant approach to evaluate patients.

METHODS: Outpatients aged 14-21, suffering from various psychiatric disorders, were assessed using the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), using data from age-matched healthy students for comparison. The relationship between CTQ, MZQ, and BDI scores was examined at the cross-sectional level, including mediation analyses, and longitudinally, in a subsample who underwent a psychotherapy intervention. RESULTS: Of 83 subjects, 33 (39.8%) had mentalization levels that were 1 standard deviation below those of comparison subjects. In the whole sample, the levels of mentalization were inversely associated with BDI (r = -.68, p < .001) and CTQ scores (r = -.30, p = .006). Moreover, MZQ scores mediated a large part of the effect of childhood trauma on depression (total effect: 10.6, 95% CI: 5.3, 15.9; direct effect: 6.5, 95% CI: 2.1, 10.8; indirect effect: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.5, 7.4). This effect was almost entirely explained by the Affect Regulation subscale. In patients re-evaluated after four sessions (n = 37), the decrease in BDI scores correlated with the increase in MZQ scores (r = .40, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: In a juvenile clinical sample, deficits of mentalization abilities were associated with the severity of depression and explained part of the depressogenic effects of childhood trauma.","Belvederi Murri, Martino; Ferrigno, Gabriella; Penati, Simona; Muzio, Caterina; Piccinini, Giulia; Innamorati, Marco; Ricci, Federica; Pompili, Maurizio; Amore, Mario",Child Adolesc Ment Health,473,33

This background has laid the foundation for telemedicine to play a role in controlling the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Telemedicine has the potential to allow the facilitation of providing the necessary medical care to patients without exposing them to contact with other patients or the general population. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the utilization of telemedicine by the Lebanese physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional online study was conducted using LimeSurvey® through an e-mail-based questionnaire sent to physicians currently enrolled in both Beirut and Tripoli Lebanese Order of Physicians. Results: Four hundred one physicians completed the survey resulting in a response rate of 5.85%. Most of the respondents (N = 401, 75.8%) reported using telemedicine to provide health care services to patients without in-person visits during the pandemic. Among those using telemedicine (N = 304), around 40% reported that they started using it during COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: Literature states that the average time of an in-person clinic consultation is more than 15 min. This implies that telemedicine can play a role in saving physicians' time; this conclusion is supported by other studies that consider telemedicine a time-saving method of providing health care services. Conclusions: Our study indicated that telemedicine is used by the majority of Lebanese physicians and that this use has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results showed that telemedicine does have a potential that can allow it to be integrated in the health care system and implemented on a national organized level.","Shaarani, Issam; Ghanem, Ali; Jounblat, Mohammad; Jounblat, Hadi; Mansour, Reem; Taleb, Rim",Telemed. j. e. health,473,33

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational retrospective cohort study including 2511 patients with COVID-19 who came to our emergency department between March 1 and April 30, 2020. We analyzed variables with Kaplan Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: All-cause mortality was 8% at 30 days. Independent variables associated with higher risk of mortality were age over 50 years, a Barthel index score less than 90, altered mental status, the ratio of arterial oxygen saturation to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FIO2), abnormal lung sounds, platelet concentration less than 100 000/mm3, a C-reactive protein concentration of 5 mg/dL or higher, and a glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/min. Each independent predictor was assigned 1 point in the score except age, which was assigned 2 points. Risk was distributed in 3 levels: low risk (score of 4 points or less), intermediate risk (5 to 6 points), and high risk (7 points or above). Thirty-day risk of mortality was 1.7% for patients who scored in the low-risk category, 28.2% for patients with an intermediate risk score, and 67.3% for those with a high risk score.

The video communication in the wireless network experiences Quality of Services (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) issues due to network dynamics. The parameters, such as node mobility, routing protocols, and distance between the nodes, play a major role in the quality of video communication. Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is an extension to H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC), allows partial removal of layers, and generates a valid adapted bit-stream. This adaptation feature enables the streaming of video data over a wireless network to meet the availability of the resources. The video adaptation is a dynamic process and requires prior knowledge to decide the adaptation parameter for extraction of the video levels. This research work aims at building the adaptation parameters that are required by the adaptation engines, such as Media Aware Network Elements (MANE), to perform adaptation on-the-fly. The prior knowledge improves the performances of the adaptation engines and gives the improved quality of the video communication. The unique feature of this work is that, here, we used an experimental evaluation method to identify the video levels that are suitable for a given network condition. In this paper, we estimated the adaptation parameters for streaming scalable video over the wireless network using the experimental method. The adaptation parameters are derived using node mobility, link bandwidth, and motion level of video sequences as deciding parameters.

Although there are no solid studies to support general recommendations, experiences with other viral infections (hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus) suggest that management of immunosuppression without mycophenolate mofetil or m-Tor inhibitors (drugs that are also associated with leukopenia and lymphopenia) may be beneficial. It is also important to pay attention to possible drug interactions, especially in the case of tacrolimus, with some of the treatments with antiviral effect given in the context of COVID 19 (lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin). Finally, the immunosuppressive effect of immunomodulating drugs (tocilizumab and similar) administered to patients with severe lung disease should be taken into account. The mechanisms of action of the different immunosuppressive drugs are reviewed in this article, as well as their potential effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggests guidelines for the management of immunosuppression.","Forns, Xavier; Navasa, Miquel",Gastroenterol Hepatol,473,1

Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 and evaluated outcomes in those with and without COPD and/or emphysema. Patients were identified as having COPD if they had a diagnosis in the medical record and a history of airflow-obstruction on spirometry, or a history of tobacco use and prescribed long-acting bronchodilator(s). Computed tomography scans were evaluated by radiologists. Propensity matching was performed for age, body-mass index (BMI), and serologic data correlated with severity of COVID-19 disease (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, absolute lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, and lactate dehydrogenase). Results: Of 577 patients admitted with COVID-19, 103 had a diagnosis of COPD and/or emphysema. The COPD/emphysema cohort was older (67 vs 58, p<0.0001) than the other cohort and had a lower BMI. Among unmatched cohorts those with COPD/emphysema had higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (35% vs 24.9%, p=0.036) and maximal respiratory support requirements, with more frequent invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 11.8%), but no significant difference in mortality. After propensity-matching there was no difference in ICU admission, maximal respiratory support requirements, or mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses yielded similar results. Discussion: Our propensity-matched retrospective cohort study suggests that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that have COPD and/or emphysema may not have worse outcomes than those without these comorbid conditions.","Marron, Robert M; Zheng, Matthew; Fernandez Romero, Gustavo; Zhao, Huaqing; Patel, Raj; Leopold, Ian; Thomas, Ashanth; Standiford, Taylor; Kumaran, Maruti; Patlakh Jeffrey Stewart, Nicole; Criner, Gerard J",,473,1

The Incredible Years® (IY) Parent Program is a group intervention that has demonstrated efficacy in terms of reducing stress in parents, as well as improving behavioral, emotional, and social outcomes in children. The program has been recently adapted for families of children with autism or language delays (IY-ASLD®). This intervention has not yet been implemented in the Spanish Public Health System, where there is a scarcity of evidence-based interventions being offered to families with young children presenting neurodevelopmental problems. The main aims of this study are to determine the feasibility of implementing the IY-ASLD® program within Spanish Child Mental Health Services and to examine parents' acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate its preliminary effectiveness in terms of reducing parental stress and behavioral difficulties in their children. The FIRST STEPS study is a multicenter, pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the IY-ASLD® program with a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Approximately 70 families of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and preterm children with communication and/or socialization difficulties (aged 2-5 years) will be recruited. Families will be assessed prior to randomization and after the intervention. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention will consist of 22 weekly online sessions (approximately 6 months). The FIRST STEPS pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of reliably implementing the IY-ASLD® program within the Spanish Public Health System. The results of this study could represent the first step to inform policymakers in Spain when designing evidence-based healthcare pathways for families of children presenting ASD symptoms or neurodevelopmental difficulties at early stages.

Particular attention has been devoted to the role of infection control, family engagement, staff performance, and the built environment ramifications of the recent COVID-19 global pandemic. A comprehensive review of this literature is reported summarizing recent advancements in this rapidly expanding body of knowledge. PURPOSE AND AIM: This comprehensive review conceptually structures the recent medical intensive care literature to provide conceptual clarity and identify current priorities and future evidence-based research and design priorities. METHOD AND RESULT: Each source reviewed was classified as one of the five types-opinion pieces/essays, cross-sectional empirical investigations, nonrandomized comparative investigations, randomized studies, and policy review essays-and into nine content categories: nature engagement and outdoor views; family accommodations; intensive care unit (ICU), neonatal ICU, and pediatric ICU spatial configuration and amenity; noise considerations; artificial and natural lighting; patient safety and infection control; portable critical care field hospitals and disaster mitigation facilities including COVID-19; ecological sustainability; and recent planning and design trends and prognostications. CONCLUSIONS: Among the findings embodied in the 135 literature sources reviewed, single-bed ICU rooms have increasingly become the norm; family engagement in the ICU experience has increased; acknowledgment of the therapeutic role of staff amenities; exposure to nature, view, and natural daylight has increased; the importance of ecological sustainability; and pandemic concerns have increased significantly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

However, due to the harsh conditions of the preparation process, the commercial production of all-solid-state electrolytes remains a challenge. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has caused great inconvenience to people, while also allowing soft, lightweight and mass-producible non-woven fabrics in masks come into sight. Here, a polymer/polymer solid composite electrolyte is obtained by introducing the polyamide 6 (PA6) microfiber non-woven fabric into PEO polymer through the hot-pressing method. The addition of the PA6 non-woven fabric with lithium-philic properties can not only reduce the crystallinity of the polymer, but also provide more functional transmission sites and then promote the migration of lithium ions at the molecular level. Moreover, due to the sufficient mechanical strength and flexibility of the PA6 non-woven fabric, the composite electrolyte shows excellent inhibition ability of lithium dendrite growth and high electrochemical stability. The novel design concept of introducing low-cost and large-scale production of non-woven fabrics into all-solid-state composite electrolytes to develop high-performance lithium metal batteries is attractive, and can also be broadened to the combination of different types of polymers to meet the needs of various batteries.","Gao, Lu; Sarmad, Bushra; Li, Jianxin; Cheng, Bowen; Kang, Weimin; Deng, Nanping",J Power Sources,473,16

Much of this is concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas where urban development spreads into hazard-prone areas. Often, this development is dominated by poor-quality homes in informal settlements or slums with poor tenure security. Lessons from a resilience-building project in the Pacific shows that a fit-for-purpose (FFP) approach to land administration can provide solutions by increasing the number of households with security of tenure, and consequently, improving resilience outcomes as informal settlements grow. This paper specifically discusses the influence of FFP land administration on reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks, such as climate change and COVID-19. It proposes ways to be better manage urban growth through the responsible governance of land tenure rights and more effective land-use planning to improve resilience to multiple shocks and stresses, hence, delivering improved access to safe land and shelter. Land administration systems can contribute to enhanced resilience to the shocks of climate extremes and pandemics by improving tenure security and enhancing land-use planning controls. It is argued that climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction need to be better mainstreamed into two major elements of land governance: (i) securing and safeguarding of land rights, and (ii) planning and control of land use.","Mitchell, David Barth Bernhard Ho Serene Sait M.

More use of cognitive and prosocial coping behaviors were associated with less mental health problems (standardized beta: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.34--0.27). Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated. Building on cognitive coping behaviors reappraisal or cognitive behavioral treatments may be most promising.","Guo, Jing Feng XingLin Wang XiaoHua Ijzendoorn M.

The physical, social, and organizational infrastructure of healthcare systems across the world is being stressed. This pandemic has highlighted that the healthcare of the country is as strong as its weakest link and that no aspect of life, be it social or economic, is spared from this pandemic. The authors would like to highlight some of the lessons learned from Singapores management of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the Singaporean Covid-19 pandemic, public health policy planning was all encompassing in its coverage, involving various stakeholders in government and society. The important role of individuals, governments, industry, and primary healthcare practitioners when tackling COVID-19 are highlighted. Singapores management of the Covid-19 pandemic involved an approach that involved the whole of society, with a particular focus on supporting the vulnerable foreign worker population, which formed the majority of Covid-19 cases in the country. Hopefully amidst the trying times, valuable lessons are learnt that will be etched into medical history and collective memory. We hope to highlight these lessons for future generations, both for members of the public and fellow healthcare practitioners.","Wang, Samuel S Y; Teo, Winnie Z Y",Ann Glob Health,473,23

Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of all students tested for COVID-19 at the University of Florida Student Health Care Center between March 9th and April 17th, 2020, comprising the first 6 weeks after spring break. Results: Twenty-five of 296 students (8.4%) tested positive for COVID-19. No significant differences were seen between positive and negative students regarding travel history or known exposures. Students who tested positive more commonly experienced fatigue, congestion, nausea, chest pain, anosmia, ageusia, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, and new problems sleeping over the course of illness. Conclusion: Initial symptoms unreliably clinically distinguish COVID-19 from other viral illnesses amongst college students.

The latest estimate from the World Health Organization showed that over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to assess the density of fast food outlets around educational facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We employed geospatial and quantitative analyses using data on fast food outlets (from surveys conducted between November 2019 and May 2020) and educational facilities in Riyadh city. Data analyses conducted using ArcMap 10.6 and Stata 15 compared the density within 500 m and 500-1000 m from the facilities. RESULTS: We found a high density of fast food outlets around educational facilities. Nearly 80% of fast food were within twelve-minute walking or five-minute driving distances from schools, and nearly 70% of all educational facilities had at least one fast food outlet within the buffer. We also found the densities were high within both the areas closer and the areas farther away from educational facilities. In addition, the density was significantly higher around private schools compared to government schools, and the density around girls-only schools and both-gender schools was higher than that around boys-only schools. CONCLUSION: There is a high density of fast food outlets around educational facilities in Saudi Arabia. Effective policies are needed to help reduce potential exposure to fast food among young people in Saudi Arabia and other countries with similar settings.","AlQurashi, Alaa Ashraf; Kusuma, Dian; AlJishi, Hala; AlFaiz, Ali; AlSaad, Abdulaziz",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),473,13

Many clinical studies involving AYUSH systems are being initiated and registered with Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI) since last few months. The present work is an analysis of different characteristics of these studies on the basis of available datasets. Method: ology: COVID-19 related clinical studies involving the healthcare systems of AYUSH, registered on CTRI between 1st February 2020 and 24th August 2020, were searched. They were analysed as per different characteristics such as registration month, study sites, aim, sample size, population, setting, sponsorship, intervention and comparators, duration & outcome measures. Results: A total of 197 AYUSH studies were registered on CTRI of which majority (n=113) were from Ayurveda, with another nine of them with an intra-AYUSH collaboration. The highest number of studies were registered in month of June (n=57). Maximum study sites were in Maharashtra (n=65). From the 197 total studies, only six were observational studies, with 191 being interventional studies. As an outcome, majority of the studies aimed at recovery (n=112). Majority of studies (n=105) were Government of India sponsored and proposed in AYUSH setting (n=107). The proportion of comparative studies was more than single arm studies. Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) was the most frequently mentioned drug. Conclusion: Our analysis revealed some interesting characteristics of the registered studies such as use of platform trial design, system specific criteria for assessment and personalized interventions. Though it was not possible to evaluate the quality of these studies in view of the limited dataset used for trial registration, we could notice variations in important characteristics like sample size, treatment arms, comparator used and study duration according to the primary aim of the studies. Overall, the present review underlines the formidable efforts of AYUSH sector in combating COVID-19 outbreak.","Bhapkar, Vedvati; Sawant, Tanuja; Bhalerao, Supriya",,473,20

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, paid caregivers had the potential to inadvertently spread COVID-19. We sought to characterize the effects of COVID-19 on HCAs and examine HCAs' infection prevention and control (IPC) policies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a qualitative analysis of data collected from a national survey of HCAs. Surveys were e-mailed to members of a national HCA association on March 18, 2020. Questions included queries on demographics, COVID-19 exposures, effects of COVID-19, and IPC protocols. RESULTS: 1204 HCAs responded with an average census of 96.2 (5-2800) patients daily. Across 36 states, 238 HCAs reported COVID-19 cases or exposures among caregivers. HCAs experienced challenges related to changing patient needs (e.g. decreased caregiver requests), staffing shortages (e.g., fear of COVID-19, inability to train caregivers), and management issues (e.g., inability to obtain supplies). ICP protocols varied in how HCAs followed recommended guidelines, responded to COVID-19 exposures, performed infection surveillance, and implemented precautions. Additionally, HCAs had varying policies for caregiver PTO. CONCLUSIONS: HCAs experienced COVID-19 exposures and/or cases early in the pandemic. HCAs identified staffing and PPE shortages, and lack of IPC guidance as challenges. Although caregivers are providing essential care for millions of older adults, they have been largely absent from federal, state, and health system strategies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Future policies must include HCAs and their caregivers to optimize care for older adults.","Rowe, Theresa A; Patel, Mallika; O039,; Conor, Rachel; McMackin, Sheila; Hoak, Vicki; Lindquist, Lee A",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,473,2

The normal growth of naive CFR was an inherent character rather than indicating the disease was becoming more severe. According to the law, by monitoring real-time naive CFRs, it can help outbreak-controllers know if there were many cases left unconfirmed or undiscovered in the outbreak. We reflected on the use of the naive CFR in the context of COVID-19 outbreaks. The results showed that Hubei Province of China, France and South Korea had cases that were not confirmed in a timely manner during the initial stages of the outbreak. Delayed case confirmations existed for long periods of time in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Spain.

However, current approaches to mediation analysis with multiple mediators either involve assumptions not verifiable by experiments, or estimate the effect when mediators are manipulated jointly which precludes the practical design of experiments due to curse of dimensionality, or are difficult to interpret when arbitrary causal dependencies are present. We propose a method for mediation analysis for multiple manipulable mediators with arbitrary causal dependencies. The proposed method is clinically relevant because the decomposition of the total effect does not involve effects under cross-world assumptions and focuses on the effects after manipulating (i.e. treating) one single mediator, which is more relevant in a clinical scenario. We illustrate the approach using simulated data, the""framing""dataset from political science, and the HIV-Brain Age dataset from a clinical retrospective cohort study. Our results provide potential guidance for clinical practitioners to make justified choices to manipulate one of the mediators to optimize the outcome.","Sun, Haoqi; Leone, Michael J.; Liu, Lin; Mukerji, Shabani S.; Robbins, Gregory K.; Westover, M.

We introduce a new data model for probabilistic predictions that encompasses a wide range of forecasting settings. This framework clearly defines the constituent parts of a probabilistic forecast and proposes one approach for representing these data elements. The data model is implemented in Zoltar, a new software application that stores forecasts using the data model and provides standardized API access to the data. In one real-time case study, an instance of the Zoltar web application was used to store, provide access to, and evaluate real-time forecast data on the order of 108 rows, provided by over 40 international research teams from academia and industry making forecasts of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. Tools and data infrastructure for probabilistic forecasts, such as those introduced here, will play an increasingly important role in ensuring that future forecasting research adheres to a strict set of rigorous and reproducible standards.","Reich, Nicholas G; Cornell, Matthew; Ray, Evan L; House, Katie; Le, Khoa",Sci Data,473,1

However, systems struggle when translating text from a new domain with a distinct style or vocabulary. Tuning on a representative training corpus allows good in-domain translation, but such data-centric approaches can cause over-fitting to new data and `catastrophic forgetting' of previously learned behaviour. We concentrate on more robust approaches to domain adaptation for NMT, particularly the case where a system may need to translate sentences from multiple domains. We divide techniques into those relating to data selection, model architecture, parameter adaptation procedure, and inference procedure. We finally highlight the benefits of domain adaptation and multi-domain adaptation techniques to other lines of NMT research.","Saunders, Danielle",,473,24

Furthermore, these populations typically lack proper sanitation and hygiene conditions, which are requirements to adequately control the outbreak. This paper proposes the use of System Dynamics modeling to support the public policy-making process in order to avert negative effects of the pandemic in the Brazilian favelas based on measures elicited from the social movement named ""Favelas Contra o Corona."" The simulation model assessed the effectiveness of strategies and policy bundles encompassing temporary transfer of the favela population, supply of hygiene products, emergency sanitation structures, and expansion of Intensive Care Units. Results indicate that a suitable combination of strategies can bring significant effects to the number of avoidable deaths and the availability of Intensive Care Units for the population.","Rodrigues, Vinícius Picanço; Oliveira, Igor Czermainski de; Chaves, Gisele de Lorena Diniz; Aquino, Ellen Larissa de Carvalho; Viegas, Cláudia Viviane",Rev. adm. pública (Online),473,1

Effects of PDE5i on post-LVAD outcomes including hemocompatibility-related adverse events (HRAE) are not well established. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of PDE5i on post-LVAD outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Pubmed and Embase databases from inception through November 25, 2020 to compare post-LVAD outcomes in patients with or without PDE5i use. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I2 statistic were calculated. RESULTS: Thirteen observational studies were included in this analysis. Use of PDE5i was not significantly associated with lower postoperative RVF (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.02-5.96, p=0.41). There was no significant association between PDE5i and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (OR 1.23, 95%CI 0.76-1.98, p=0.2), overall stroke (OR 0.60, 95%CI 0.21-1.68, p=0.17), ischemic stroke (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.09-4.07, p=0.38), and pump thrombosis (OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.14-3.54, p=0.46). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed no significant association between PDE5i and post-LVAD RVF. Despite the anti-platelet effects of PDE5i, there was no significant association between PDE5i and GI bleeding, overall stroke, ischemic stroke, and pump thrombosis. Randomized-controlled studies are warranted to evaluate the net benefits or harms of PDE5i in LVAD population.","Kittipibul, Veraprapas; Blumer, Vanessa; Angsubhakorn, Natthapon; Hernandez, Gabriel A; Chaparro, Sandra; Tedford, Ryan J; Agarwal, Richa",J. card. fail,473,20

METHODOLOGY: We included 28 COVID-19 patients admitted to Nantong Third Hospital from January 23 to February 26, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed using real-time RT-PCR. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory parameters were obtained from each patient. RESULTS: The vast majority (71.4%) of confirmed COVID-19 patients were brought in from outside of the city, and all others had contact history with these confirmed cases. The median age of patients was 50 years old and half had underlying diseases. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (96.4%), cough (67.9%), and chilly (28.6%), and 75.0% patients had two or more symptoms. Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein levels, and reduced absolute counts of total lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subsets were observed among the patients. The vast majority (85.7%) of patients showed bilateral or unilateral pneumonia, and three symptomatic patients and one asymptomatic case did not show abnormalities in their CT image. Among the 28 admitted patients, 24 were discharged as of February 26, 2020, with an average hospital stay of 14.96 (±4.27) days, which was not significantly associated with the interval between the onset of symptoms and admission. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of specific antiviral drugs or a vaccine, quarantine or isolation is the most effective intervention strategy for preventing the spread of the virus. Adequate supportive medical care is crucial for good prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Lu, Renfei; Qin, Jianru; Wu, Yan; Wang, Jian; Huang, Shengyong; Tian, Lijun; Zhang, Tao; Wu, Xiuming; Huang, Songping; Jin, Xia; Zhang, Chiyu",J Infect Dev Ctries,473,24

Using a fit-for-purpose SIQRM-compartment model for susceptible, infected, quarantined, recovered and mortalities on active cases, that we fitted from recorded data, a value of a statistical life year (VSLY) and an age-adjusted value of statistical life (A-VSL), we find that the economic costs of unmitigated suppression are multiples more than for early mandated suppression. We also find that using an equivalent VSLY welfare loss from fatalities to estimated GDP losses, drawn from survey data and our own estimates of the impact of suppression measures on the economy, means that for early suppression not to be the preferred strategy requires that Australia would have to incur more than 12,500-30,000 deaths, depending on the fatality rate with unmitigated spread, to the economy costs of early mandated suppression. We also find that early rather than delayed mandated suppression imposes much lower economy and health costs and conclude that in high-income countries, like Australia, a 'go early, go hard' strategy to suppress COVID-19 results in the lowest estimated public health and economy costs.","Kompas, Tom; Grafton, R Quentin; Che, Tuong Nhu; Chu, Long; Camac, James",PLoS One,473,14

This systemic involvement is postulated to be mainly related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors located on several different human cells. Lung involvement is the most common serious manifestation of the disease, ranging from asymptomatic disease or mild pneumonia, to severe disease associated with hypoxia, critical disease associated with shock, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure or death. Among patients with COVID-19, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and especially cardiovascular disease, has been associated with adverse outcomes, whereas the emergence of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias, has been associated with poor survival. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also frequently encountered and may persist for several days. Haematological complications are frequent as well and have been associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, recent studies have reported that over a third of infected patients develop a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms affecting the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscles, including anosmia and ageusia.

Others have developed analytics-driven decision-making capabilities. However, it is not clear how health systems in the United States are embracing digital technologies and there is a gap in health systems' abilities to integrate workflows with expanding technologies to spur innovation and futuristic growth. There is a lack of reliable and reported estimates of the current and futuristic digital orientations of health systems. Periodic assessments will provide imperatives to policy formulation and align efforts to yield the transformative power of emerging digital technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore and examine differences in US health systems with respect to digital orientations in the post-COVID-19 ""new normal"" in 2021. Differences were assessed in four dimensions: (1) analytics-oriented digital technologies (AODT), (2) customer-oriented digital technologies (CODT), (3) growth and innovation-oriented digital technologies (GODT), and (4) futuristic and experimental digital technologies (FEDT). The former two dimensions are foundational to health systems' digital orientation, whereas the latter two will prepare for future disruptions. METHODS: We surveyed a robust group of health system chief executive officers (CEOs) across the United States from February to March 2021. Among the 625 CEOs, 135 (22%) responded to our survey. We considered the above four broad digital technology orientations, which were ratified with expert consensus. Secondary data were collected from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Compendium, leading to a matched usable dataset of 124 health systems for analysis. We examined the relationship of adopting the four digital orientations to specific hospital characteristics and earlier reported factors as barriers or facilitators to technology adoption. RESULTS: Health systems showed a lower level of CODT (mean 4.70) or GODT (mean 4.54) orientations compared with AODT (mean 5.03), and showed the lowest level of FEDT orientation (mean 4.31). The ordered logistic estimation results provided nuanced insights. Medium-sized (P<.001) health systems, major teaching health systems (P<.001), and systems with high-burden hospitals (P<.001) appear to be doing worse with respect to AODT orientations, raising some concerns. Health systems of medium (P<.001) and large (P=.02) sizes, major teaching health systems (P=.07), those with a high revenue (P=.05), and systems with high-burden hospitals (P<.001) have less CODT orientation. Health systems in the midwest (P=.05) and southern (P=.04) states are more likely to adopt GODT, whereas high-revenue (P=.004) and investor-ownership (P=.01) health systems are deterred from GODT. Health systems of a medium size, and those that are in the midwest (P<.001), south (P<.001), and west (P=.01) are more adept to FEDT, whereas medium (P<.001) and high-revenue (P<.001) health systems, and those with a high discharge rate (P=.04) or high burden (P=.003, P=.005) have subdued FEDT orientations. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all health systems have some current foundational digital technological orientations to glean intelligence or service delivery to customers, with some notable exceptions. Comparatively, fewer health systems have growth or futuristic digital orientations. The transformative power of digital technologies can only be leveraged by adopting futuristic digital technologies. Thus, the disparities across these orientations suggest that a holistic, consistent, and well-articulated direction across the United States remains elusive. Accordingly, we suggest that a policy strategy and financial incentives are necessary to spur a well-visioned and articulated digital orientation for all health systems across the United States. In the absence of such a policy to collectively leverage digital transformations, differences in care across the country will continue to be a concern.","Khuntia, Jiban; Ning, Xue; Stacey, Rulon",J Med Internet Res,473,1

We describe a mobile monoclonal antibody infusion program for patients with COVID-19 in skilled nursing facilities and provide descriptive data on its outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Collaboration between Mayo Clinic and skilled nursing facilities in Southeast Minnesota was developed to administer anti-spike monoclonal antibodies under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy five residents of skilled nursing facilities at high risk of COVID-19 complications. EXPOSURE: Emergency use treatment with bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab. MEASUREMENTS: Hospitalization and medically attended visits. RESULTS: The mobile infusion unit, staffed by Mayo Clinic Infusion Therapy registered nurses and supported by the skilled nursing facility staff, infused anti-spike monoclonal antibodies to 45 of 75 patients (average age, 77.8 years) in December 2020. The infusions occurred at an average of 4.3 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Fourteen days after infusion, there were no deaths, two emergency department visits, and three hospitalizations, for a combined event rate of 11.1%. There was one reported adverse event. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a mobile infusion unit embedded in a collaborative process resulted in rapid infusion of monoclonal antibodies to high-risk COVID-19 patients in skilled nursing facilities, who would otherwise be unable to access the novel therapies. The therapies were well tolerated and appear beneficial. Further study is warranted to explore the scalability and efficacy of this program.","Tulledge-Scheitel, Sidna; Bell, Sarah J; Larsen, Jennifer J; Bierle, Dennis M; Takahashi, Paul; Moehnke, Darcie E; Destro Borgen, Molly J; Springer, Donna J; Reinschmidt, Karen J; Baumbach, Lori J; Matoush, Jennifer A; Heyliger, Alexander; Hanson, Sara N; Razonable, Raymund R; Ganesh, Ravindra",J Am Geriatr Soc,473,26

Repositioning hydroxychloroquine (HQ) seems to be a promising option. Many emerging evidences have converged on the effectiveness of HQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection. In a recent paper, Gautret et al. suggested that further works are needed to determine if HQ antiviral prophylaxis is useful, especially for healthcare workers. METHODS: The purpose of this paper is to assess the Covid-19 exposure and risks level among caregivers. For this, we performed research on internet and PubMed by crossing the following keywords: healthcare givers, healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, coronavirus, Covid-19, mortality, infection rate, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: Data on healthcare worker's infection and mortality by Covid-19 are partial and are not systematically published. However, it seems that the infection rate varies between 3.8% and 9% depending on the country. Moreover, the mean age of this population is relatively old, especially in the OECD area. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Covid-19 HQ prophylaxis should be urgently accessed, especially for healthcare workers. It is to be hoped that HQ prophylaxis reduces the morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 infection among this population which is particularly exposed and relatively old.","Tahiri Joutei Hassani, Rachid; Bennis, Ahmed",J Infect Public Health,473,29

Objective: To determine the independent associations of voluntary behavioral change, school closures, and bans on large gatherings with the incidence and mortality due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based, interrupted-time-series analysis of lagged independent variables used publicly available observational data from US states during a 60-day period from March 8 to May 18, 2020. The behavioral measures were collected from anonymized cell phone or internet data for individuals in the US and compared with a baseline of January 3 to February 6, 2020. Estimates were also controlled for several state-level characteristics. Exposures: Days since school closure, days since a ban on gatherings of 10 or more people, and days since residents voluntarily conducted a 15% or more decline in time spent at work via Google Mobility data. Main Outcomes and Measures: The natural log of 7-day mean COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results: During the study period, the rate of restaurant dining declined from 1 year earlier by a mean (SD) of 98.3% (5.2%) during the study period. Time at work declined by a mean (SD) of 40.0% (7.9%); time at home increased by a mean (SD) of 15.4% (3.7%). In fully adjusted models, a delay of 1 day in implementing mandatory school closures was associated with a 3.5% reduction (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.965; 95% CI, 0.946-0.984) in incidence, whereas each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.3% reduction (IRR, 0.907; 95% CI, 0.890-0.925) in incidence. For mortality, each day of delay in school closures was associated with a subsequent 3.8% reduction (IRR, 0.962; 95% CI, 0.926-0.998), and each day of delay in behavioral change was associated with a 9.8% reduction (IRR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.869-0.936). Simulations suggest that a 2-week delay in school closures alone would have been associated with an additional 23â¯000 (95% CI, 2000-62â¯000) deaths, whereas a 2-week delay in voluntary behavioral change with school closures remaining the same would have been associated with an additional 140â¯000 (95% CI, 65â¯000-294â¯000) deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: In light of the harm to children of closing schools, these findings suggest that policy makers should consider better leveraging the public's willingness to protect itself through voluntary behavioral change.","Zimmerman, Frederick J; Anderson, Nathaniel W",JAMA pediatr.

Cancer patients seem to be more susceptible to infection and disease deterioration, but the factors affecting the deterioration remain unclear. We aimed to develop an individualized model for prediction of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deterioration in cancer patients. The clinical data of 276 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in 33 designated hospitals of Hubei, China from December 21, 2019 to March 18, 2020, were collected and randomly divided into a training and a validation cohort by a ratio of 2:1. Cox stepwise regression analysis was carried out to select prognostic factors. The prediction model was developed in the training cohort. The predictive accuracy of the model was quantified by C-index and time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (t-AUC). Internal validation was assessed by the validation cohort. Risk stratification based on the model was carried out. Decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the model. We found age, cancer type, computed tomography baseline image features (ground glass opacity and consolidation), laboratory findings (lymphocyte count, serum levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, direct bilirubin, urea, and d-dimer) were significantly associated with symptomatic deterioration. The C-index of the model was 0.755 in the training cohort and 0.779 in the validation cohort. The t-AUC values were above 0.7 within 8 weeks both in the training and validation cohorts. Patients were divided into two risk groups based on the nomogram: low-risk (total points &#8804; 9.98) and high-risk (total points > 9.98) group. The Kaplan-Meier deterioration-free survival of COVID-19 curves presented significant discrimination between the two risk groups in both training and validation cohorts. The model indicated good clinical applicability by DCA curves.

The case was under mechanical ventilation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the airway was on a closed circuit. This indicates that COVID-19 is associated with not only lung injury but also intestinal damage, and that proper protective protocols are essential in guaranteeing the best outcomes for patients and clinical professionals during this pandemic.","Murota, Ayako; Yoshi, Shinji; Okuda, Ryu; Oowada, Sae; Yamakawa, Tsukasa; Kazama, Tomoe; Hirayama, Daisuke; Ishigami, Keisuke; Yamano, Hiro-O; Narimatu, Eichi; Sugita, Shintaro; Hasegawa, Tadashi; Nakase, Hiroshi",Clin J Gastroenterol,473,16

METHODS: OSA diagnosis and COVID-19 infection were extracted from the hospital discharge, causes of death and infectious diseases registries in individuals who participated in the FinnGen study (n=260 405). Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine association. Comorbidities for either COVID-19 or OSA were selected as covariates. We performed a meta-analysis with previous studies. RESULTS: We identified 445 individuals with COVID-19, and 38 (8.5%) of them with OSA of whom 19 out of 91 (20.9%) were hospitalised. OSA associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation independent from age, sex, BMI and comorbidities (p-unadjusted=5.13×10-5, OR-adjusted=2.93 (95% CI 1.02 to 8.39), p-adjusted=0.045). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.25). A meta-analysis of OSA and severe COVID-19 showed association across 15 835 COVID-19 positive controls, and n=1294 patients with OSA with severe COVID-19 (OR=2.37 (95% 1.14 to 4.95), p=0.021). CONCLUSION: Risk for contracting COVID-19 was the same for patients with OSA and those without OSA. In contrast, among COVID-19 positive patients, OSA was associated with higher risk for hospitalisation. Our findings are in line with earlier works and suggest OSA as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19.","Strausz, Satu; Kiiskinen, Tuomo; Broberg, Martin; Ruotsalainen, Sanni; Koskela, Jukka; Bachour, Adel; Palotie, Aarno; Palotie, Tuula; Ripatti, Samuli; Ollila, Hanna M",,473,1

The use of Ni as a catalyst for the steam reforming of methane has led us to look at Ni nanoclusters as potential candidates for the direct conversion of methane. Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn nanoclusters are also focused on. How the type of C1 fragments (CH4, CH3, CH2, CH, and C) stabilized by the metal nanoclusters as adsorbed species varies with metal species is theoretically investigated. The particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is based on swarm intelligence, as well as density functional theory, is used for this calculation. The Ni nanoclusters are found to preferentially adsorb C as a stable species, the Fe and the Co nanoclusters both CH and CH3, and the Cu nanoclusters CH3; the Zn nanoclusters are found not to chemisorb any C1 fragment. The methane activation capacity can be ranked in the order of Ni > Fe > Co > Cu > Zn. The highest methane activation capacity of Ni is due to the strongest covalent nature of the interaction between Ni and the adsorbed species. The ionicity of the bond between Fe and the adsorbed species is higher than that between Co and the adsorbed species, while the covalent nature of the bonds is comparable for both. The weak methane activation ability of Cu compared to Fe, Co, and Ni is found to be due to the fact that both the covalent and ionic bond strengths between Cu and the adsorbed species are weak. Zn and the adsorbed species form neither ionic nor covalent bonds. These results indicate that the Fe and the Co nanoclusters as well as the Ni may lead to the over-oxidation of methane, whereas the Zn nanoclusters cannot activate methane in the first place; therefore, their application to direct methane conversion catalysts is unlikely. Since the Cu nanoclusters do not adsorb C and CH as stable species, but CH3 stably, the Cu nanoclusters are expected to work as a catalyst for the direct conversion of methane.","Hori, Mikiya; Tsuji, Yuta; Yoshizawa, Kazunari",PCCP.

Although these trials can offer significant advantages over traditional clinical trials, the process of designing and implementing direct-to-family studies is poorly defined, especially in children with rheumatic disease. This paper provides lessons learnt from the design and implementation of a self-controlled, direct-to-family pilot trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a medication management device on adherence to hydroxychloroquine in paediatric SLE. METHODS: Several design features accommodate a direct-to-family approach. Participants meeting eligibility criteria from across the USA were identified a priori through a disease registry, and all outcome data are collected remotely. The primary outcome (medication adherence) is evaluated using electronic medication event-monitoring, plasma drug levels, patient questionnaires and pill counts. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include (1) lupus disease activity measured by a remote SLE Disease Activity Index examination and the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire; and (2) hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Recruitment of the initial target of 20 participants was achieved within 10 days. Due to initial recruitment success, enrolment was increased to 26 participants. Additional participants who were interested were placed on a waiting list in case of dropouts during the study. DISCUSSION AND DISSEMINATION: Direct-to-family trials offer several advantages but present unique challenges. Lessons learnt from the protocol development, design, and implementation of this trial will inform future direct-to-family trials for children and adults with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, the data collected remotely in this trial will provide critical information regarding the accuracy of teleresearch in lupus, the impact of adherence to hydroxychloroquine on disease activity and a pharmacokinetic analysis to inform paediatric-specific dosing of hydroxychloroquine.

Five databases were searched (December 2019-May 2020). We included both published and pre-print original articles in English that applied AI, machine learning or deep learning in drug repurposing, novel drug discovery, vaccine and antibody development for COVID-19. Out of 31 studies included, 16 studies applied AI for drug repurposing, whereas 10 studies utilized AI for novel drug discovery. Only four studies used AI technology for vaccine development, whereas one study generated stable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Approx. 50% of studies exclusively targeted 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2, and only two studies targeted ACE/TMPSS2 for inhibiting host viral interactions. Around 16% of the identified drugs are in different phases of clinical evaluation against COVID-19. AI has emerged as a promising solution of COVID-19 therapeutics. During this current pandemic, many of the researchers have used AI-based strategies to process large databases in a more customized manner leading to the faster identification of several potential targets, novel/repurposing of drugs and vaccine candidates. A number of these drugs are either approved or are in a late-stage clinical trial and are potentially effective against SARS-CoV2 indicating validity of the methodology. However, as the use of AI-based screening program is currently in budding stage, sole reliance on such algorithms is not advisable at this current point of time and an evidence based approach is warranted to confirm their usefulness against this life-threatening disease.

COVID-19 has only worsened this situation.1 An opioid receptor antagonist (ORA) such as naloxone is the most common intervention for OIRD. However, with increasing overdose from highly potent illicit opioids and polysubstance abuse, appraisal of the adequacy of ORA seems warranted and timely. COMMENT: OIRD results from the binding of an excess number of agonist molecules to opioid receptors. Mechanistically, it makes sense to reverse this by displacing agonist molecules by administering an ORA. But realistically, the trend to higher-potency agonists and polysubstance abuse diminishes the effectiveness of this approach. We are left facing a crisis without a solution. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: For the increasingly common OIRD from highly potent illicit agonists and polysubstance overdose, ORAs are correspondingly less effective.

METHODS: We summarized the epidemic prevention and control policies in Japan, Italy, China, and Singapore, and analyzed the policy effects of these four countries by using the data published by Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. RESULTS: As of May 27, 2020, the growing trend of new cases in Japan, Italy, China and Singapore has stabilized. However, the cumulative number of confirmed cases (231139) and case-fatality rate (14.3%) in Italy far exceeded those in the other three countries, and the effect of epidemic control was inferior. Singapore began to experience a domestic resurgence after April 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases reaching 32,876, but the case-fatality rate remained extremely low (0.1%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in China (84547) was almost stagnant, and the case-fatality rate was low (5.5%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in Japan (16661) increased slowly, and the case-fatality rate (4.8%) was slightly lower than that in China. CONCLUSION: This study divided the epidemic prevention and control policies of the four countries into two categories: the blocking measures adopted by China and Singapore, and the mitigation measures adopted by Japan and Italy. According to the Epidemic control results of these four countries, we can conclude that the blocking measures were generally effective. As the core strategy of blocking measures, admitting mild patients into hospital and cases tracing helped curb the spread of the outbreak in Singapore and China. Countries should choose appropriate response strategies on the premise of considering their own situation, increase investment in health resources to ensure global health equity, and eventually control the spread of infectious diseases in the world effectively.","Wang, Xiaohan; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Chen, Haiqian; Sun, Gang",Int J Equity Health,473,16

In addition, the reason behind the impaired chemesthetic sensations in some coronavirus patients remains unknown. In the present paper it is proposed that SARS-CoV-2 patients suffer from depletion of tryptophan, as ACE2, a key element in the process of absorption of tryptophan from the food, is significantly reduced in the patients as coronavirus uses ACE2 as the receptor to enter the host cells. The tryptophan depletion leads to a deficit of serotonin (5-HT) in SARS-COV-2 patients because tryptophan is the precursor in the synthesis of 5-HT. Such 5-HT deficiency can explain anosmia, ageusia and dysfunctional chemesthesis in COVID-19, given the fact that 5-HT is an important neuromodulator in the olfactory neurons, taste receptor cells and transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) involved in chemesthesis. In addition, 5-HT deficiency worsens silent hypoxemia and depresses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to increased severity of the disease. Also, the levels of anti-inflammatory melatonin (synthesized from 5-HT) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, produced from niacin whose precursor is the tryptophan) might decrease in coronavirus patients resulting in the aggravation of the disease. Interestingly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may not be of much help in correcting the 5-HT deficiency in COVID-19 patients, as their efficacy goes down significantly when there is depletion of tryptophan in the system. Hence, tryptophan supplementation may herald a radical change in the treatment of COVID-19 and accordingly, clinical trials (therapeutic / prophylactic) should be conducted on coronavirus patients to find out how tryptophan supplementation (oral or parenteral, the latter in severe cases where there is hardly any absorption of tryptophan from the food) helps in curing, relieving or preventing the olfactory, gustatory and chemesthetic dysfunctions and in lessening the severity of the disease.","Sen, Amarnath",Med Hypotheses,473,32

This paper gives an explanation for the failure of machine learning models in this particular forecasting problem. The paper shows that simple linear regression models provide high prediction accuracy values reliably but only for a 2-weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning models, which have the potential of learning long term predictions with low errors, cannot achieve to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization ability. It is suggested in the paper that the lack of a sufficient number of samples is the source of low prediction performance of the forecasting models. The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is measured in terms of the cross-validation prediction errors, which are used as expectations for the generalization errors of the forecasters. To exploit the information, which is of most relevant with the active cases, we perform feature selection over a variety of variables. We apply different feature selection methods, namely the Pairwise Correlation, Recursive Feature Selection, and feature selection by using the Lasso regression and compare them to each other and also with the models not employing any feature selection. Furthermore, we compare Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Long-Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases together with the mentioned feature selection methods. Our results show that the accurate forecasting of the active cases with high generalization ability is possible up to 3 days only because of the small sample size of COVID-19 data.","Nakip, Mert; cCopur, Onur; Guzelics, Cuneyt",,473,1

The most effective surveillance system consists of doing massive tests. Nonetheless, many countries cannot afford this class of health campaigns due to limited resources. Thus, a transmission model is a viable alternative to study the dynamics of the pandemic. The most used are the Susceptible, Infected and Removed type models (SIR). In this study, we tackle the population estimation problem of the A-SIR model, which takes into account asymptomatic or undetected individuals. By means of an algebraic differential approach, we design a model-free (no copy system) reduced-order estimation algorithm (observer) to determine the different non-measured population groups. We study two types of estimation algorithms: Proportional and Proportional-Integral. Both shown fast convergence speed, as well as a minimal estimation error. Additionally, we introduce random fluctuations in our analysis to represent changes in the external conditions and which result in poor measurements. The numerical results reveal that both model-free estimators are robust despite the presence of these fluctuations. As a point of reference, we apply the classical Luenberger type observer to our estimation problem and compare the results. Finally, we consider real data of infected individuals in Mexico City, reported from February 2020 to March 2021, and estimate the non-measured populations. Our work's main goal is to proportionate a simple and therefore, an accessible methodology to estimate the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic from the available data, such that the competent authorities can propose more adequate health politics.","Martínez-Guerra, Rafael; Flores-Flores, Juan Pablo",Appl Math Comput,473,29

Objective: To characterize the association of planned in-person school attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic with factors, including family socioeconomic characteristics, and parent attitudes and beliefs about their child's school attendance. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional survey study. Data were collected from June 2, 2020, to June 5, 2020, weighted to reflect population norms, and analyzed using ordered probit regression. A sample of US parents (of children ages 5-17 years) were recruited using a nonprobability survey panel with stratification by socioeconomic characteristics. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was parent-reported plan to send their child to school or keep their child home, conditional on their school opening for in-person instruction. Additional measures assessed family socioeconomic characteristics, medical vulnerability, worry about COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome, confidence in their child's school, and homeschooling difficulties. Results: The sample of 730 parents was balanced by parent sex (53% women) with successful oversampling for Black (28%; n = 201) and Hispanic (27%; n = 200) participants. In estimates weighted to US population norms, 31% (95% CI, 27% to 34%) of participants indicated they would probably or definitely keep their child home this fall, and 49% indicated that they would probably or definitely send their child to school this fall. Factors associated with planning to keep children home included lower income (38% with incomes <$50â¯000 vs 21% with incomes $100â¯000-$150â¯000 per year; difference, 17%; 95% CI, 9% to 26%), being unemployed (40% unemployed vs 26% employed; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 25%), and having a flexible job (33% with flexible jobs vs 19% with inflexible jobs; difference, 14%; 95% CI, 5% to 30%). Planning to keep children home was also associated with fear of COVID-19 (B = 0.19; P < .001), fear of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (B = 0.12; P = .04), confidence in schools (B = -0.22; P < .001), and challenges of homeschooling (B = -0.12; P = .01). Race and ethnicity were not significantly associated with plans to keep children home. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, many parents planned to keep children home in fall 2020. Schools need to act soon to address parental concerns and provide options for what will be available for them should they opt to keep their child home. Structural barriers, such as lack of workplace flexibility and potential school-level inequities in implementation of preventive measures, must be acknowledged and addressed where possible.","Kroshus, Emily; Hawrilenko, Matt; Tandon, Pooja S; Christakis, Dimitri A",JAMA pediatr.

Boroughs of New York City, including Queens county, turn out to be the epicenters of this infection. According to the data provided by the New York State Department of Health, most of the cases of new COVID-19 infections in New York City have been found in the Queens county where 42,023 people have tested positive, and 3221 people have died as of 20 April 2020. Person-to-person transmission and travels were implicated in the initial spread of the outbreaks, but factors related to the late phase of rapidly spreading outbreaks in March and April are still uncertain. A few previous studies have explored the links between air pollution and COVID-19 infections, but more data is needed to understand the effects of short-term exposures of air pollutants and meteorological factors on the spread of COVID-19 infections, particularly in the U.S. disease epicenters. In this study, we have focused on ozone and PM2.5, two major air pollutants in New York City, which were previously found to be associated with respiratory viral infections. The aim of our regression modeling was to explore the associations among ozone, PM2.5, daily meteorological variables (wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, cloud percentages, and precipitation levels), and COVID-19 confirmed new cases and new deaths in Queens county, New York during March and April 2020. The results from these analyses showed that daily average temperature, daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentration, average relative humidity, and cloud percentages were significantly and positively associated with new confirmed cases related to COVID-19;none of these variables showed significant associations with new deaths related to COVID-19. The findings indicate that short-term exposures to ozone and other meteorological factors can influence COVID-19 transmission and initiation of the disease, but disease aggravation and mortality depend on other factors.","Adhikari, A.; Yin, JingJing",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,473,24

In two periods and seasons, marine debris was sampled on nine sandy beaches of Rio de Janeiro, grouped by levels of access. The general marine debris density has decreased over time, accompanied by an improvement in public cleaning mechanisms. The most important predictor for the majority of marine debris items is related to accessibility; beaches with restricted access showed a reduction in the abundance of most items. High marine debris densities, even on beaches with restricted access, showed that all evaluated beaches can be sinks for marine debris circulating in marine waters.

Coronavirus infection causes tissue damage, which triggers the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequent eicosanoid and cytokine storms. Although proinflammatory eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, are critical mediators of physiological processes, such as inflammation, fever, allergy, and pain, their role in COVID-19 is poorly characterized. Arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids could alleviate the systemic hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 infection by modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and stimulating the resolution of inflammation. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors, which increase endogenous epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels, exhibit potent anti-inflammatory activity and inhibit various pathologic processes in preclinical disease models, including pulmonary fibrosis, thrombosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, targeting eicosanoids and sEH could be a novel therapeutic approach in combating COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the predominant role of eicosanoids in regulating the inflammatory cascade and propose the potential application of sEH inhibitors in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms. We also discuss the host-protective action of omega-3 fatty acid-derived epoxyeicosanoids and specialized proresolving mediators in regulating anti-inflammation and antiviral response. Future studies determining the eicosanoid profile in COVID-19 patient or preclinical model are pivotal in providing the novel insight of coronavirus-host interaction and inflammation modulation.","Hammock, Bruce D; Wang, Weicang; Gilligan, Molly M; Panigrahy, Dipak",Am. j. pathol,473,20

The therapeutic approaches used to treat these patients are not always available, may be not be accepted by some patients, and often require face-to-face interactions. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of an Internet-based adjuvant lifestyle-based intervention for patients with TRD. METHODS: This will be a parallel, randomized, and controlled clinical trial. A total of 180 patients with TRD will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 groups: treatment prescribed by the mental health team and written suggestions for lifestyle changes (placebo control group); treatment prescribed by the mental health team, written suggestions for lifestyle changes, and an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy program (active control group); or treatment prescribed by the mental health team, written suggestions for lifestyle changes, and an 8-week lifestyle change promotion program (intervention group). We will perform this study during the COVID-19 pandemic, and will administer interventions by teletherapy, and contact participants by telephone calls, text messages, and/or teleconferences. We will collect patient data using questionnaires administered at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and after 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome will be score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II. The secondary outcomes will be score on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (used to quantify and track patient progress and treatment response over time) and health-related quality of life measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire. DISCUSSION: Patients with TRD are especially vulnerable when face-to-face psychotherapy is unavailable. The main strength of the proposed study is the novelty of the intervention to be used as an adjuvant therapy. Our results may provide guidance for treatment of patients with TRD in future situations that require lockdown measures.

It is important to monitor the evolving role of technology in MHA services. Given that MHA policy documents represent the highest level of priorities for a government's vision and strategy for mental health care, one starting point is to measure the frequency with which technology is mentioned and the terms used to describe its use in MHA policy documents (before, during, and after COVID-19). Yet, to our knowledge, no such review of the extent to which ICTs are referred to in Canadian MHA policy documents exists to date. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic policy review was to examine the extent to which technology is addressed in Canadian government-based MHA policy documents prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to establish a baseline for documenting change. METHODS: We reviewed 22 government-based MHA policy documents, published between 2011 and 2019 by 13 Canadian provinces and territories. We conducted content analysis to synthesize the policy priorities addressed in these documents into key themes, and then systematically searched for and tabulated the use of 39 technology-related keywords (in English and French) to describe and compare jurisdictions. RESULTS: Technology was addressed in every document, however, to a varying degree. Of the 39 searched keywords, we identified 22 categories of keywords pertaining to the use of technology to deliver MHA services and information. The 6 most common categories were tele (n=16/22), phone (n=12/22), tech (n=11/22), online (n=10/22), line (n=10/22), and web (n=10/22), with n being the number of policy documents in which the category was mentioned out of 22 documents. The use of terms referring to advanced technologies, such as virtual (n=6/22) and app (n= 4/22), were less frequent. Additionally, policy documents from some provinces and territories (eg, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador) mentioned a diverse range of ICTs, whereas others described only 1 form of ICT. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that technology has been given limited strategic attention in Canadian MHA policy. Policy makers may have limited knowledge on the evidence and potential of using technology in this field, highlighting the value for knowledge translation and collaborative initiatives among policy makers and researchers. The development of a pan-Canadian framework for action addressing the integration and coordination of technology in mental health services can also guide initiatives in this field.

The second aim is to suggest minimally invasive treatment alternatives for caries management, minimising the risk of viral cross-infection and offering a safer clinical environment. METHODS: An evidence-based pertinent literature search of different electronic databases was performed in addition to leading global dental authorities, royal colleges, and programmes. RESULTS: All guidelines released in response to COVID-19 centred around minimising Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGP) impacting the provision of regular dental treatment of paediatric patients. There was an emphasis on triaging and only treating emergency and urgent cases. Special attention was given to medically compromised children in the guidelines. Detailed guidelines for the dental environment and equipment were given. This paper also summarised the relevant evidence-based guidelines for the use of non-invasive and minimally invasive caries management techniques. CONCLUSION: Specific recommendations for dental management of paediatric patients during and in the post-COVID-19 era are suggested. Minimisation of AGP procedures, and case-based selection of biological, non-invasive or minimally invasive methods are recommended.","Al-Halabi, M; Salami, A; Alnuaimi, E; Kowash, M; Hussein, I",Eur Arch Paediatr Dent,473,26

Currently, there are vaccine candidates in clinical trials and development, so it is only a matter of time before one is authorised for human use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected public opinion survey results about attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination conducted in 2020 in 26 European countries. RESULTS: The pooled surveys were conducted on a total of 24 970 participants; on average only 58% (n=14 365/24 970) of responders across Europe were willing to get a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available, 16% (n=3998/24 970) were neutral, and 26% (n=6607/24 970) were not planning to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Such a low vaccination response could make it exceedingly difficult to reach the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. CONCLUSION: It is very important to start conducting educational public health activities on the topic of vaccination as soon as possible, before a vaccine becomes available, in order to improve attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Only by educating the general public about the benefits, safety and efficacy of vaccines can we hope to avoid the unnecessary prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marcec, Robert; Majta, Matea; Likic, Robert",Postgrad. med. j,473,20

This highly contagious communicable disease has put not only infected individuals but other patients and frontline workers like nurses at risk in hospitals, especially in Intensive Care units (ICUs). There is a need for minimizing patient contact, improving hand hygiene practices, and optimizing healthcare provider time, especially nurses. Globally it is estimated that nearly a million health care providers have been infected with COVID-19 as of the end of October 2020. METHODS: This retrospective service evaluation documents the experience of health care providers in a COVID-19 ICU in India that was used to implement new protocols for secretion management and oral hygiene. Patient chart information and staff feedback were utilized. INTERVENTION: This pilot study captures the practical benefits of using VAPCare, an automated, closed-loop system for oral secretion removal. RESULTS: Six patients were included in this small-scale study; three patients following the current standard of care for suctioning and oral hygiene and three receiving the new VAPCare and Lumen device protocol. With the new device protocol, the number of infected secretion interactions by a nurse was 50% lower, and nursing time spent on oral hygiene and secretion management 70% less than seen with the current standard of care. The number of disposable gloves used with VAPCare and Lumen was reduced by over 50%. All 10 nurses and six doctors gave positive feedback on device usage. The department recommended updating protocols to prioritize the use of the new secretion management system for patients with COVID19 and other highly contagious conditions.

Countries in the Northern Hemisphere have been affected the most, including the United States and European countries. Contrary to the common knowledge that infectious diseases are more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, COVID-19 appears to affect wealthy countries more. This paper attempts to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 infections and levels of economic development with data from the U.S. and Europe. Methods: Public domain data on the confirmed COVID-19 cases during January 1 and May 31, 2020 by states and territories in the U.S. and by countries in Europe were included. Incidence rate was estimated using the 2019 total population. COVID-19 cases were associated with 2019 GDP using regression models after a logarithmic transformation of the data. The U.S. data and European data were analyzed separately, considering significant heterogeneity between the two. Results: A total of 2 451 691 COVID-19 cases during a 5-month period were analyzed, including 1 787 414 from 50 U.S. states and territories and 664 277 from 28 European countries. The overall incidence rate was 5.393/1000 for the U.S. and 1.411/1 000 for European countries with large variations. Lg (total cases) was significantly associated with lg (GDP) for U.S. states (= 1.2579, P < 0.001) and European countries (= 0.7156, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a positive correlation between COVID-19 case incidence and GDP. Study findings suggest a potential role of high-level development in facilitating infectious disease spread, such as better domestic and international travel for businesses and leisure, more personal freedom and more group activities. These factors must be considered in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic.","Aycock, Lauren; Chen, Xinguang",,473,16

The objective of this study is to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. We used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the extract of Liupao tea and establish its fingerprint. The main index components of the fingerprint were determined using SARS-COV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro ), and an in vitro drug screening model based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to evaluate its inhibitory activity in vitro. The fingerprint results showed that the alcohol extract of Liupao tea contained gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, epicatechin gallate, rutin, and ellagic acid. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol and showed strong binding affinity. The results of in vitro activity showed that the IC50 of EGCG was 8.84 µmol/L, which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro to a certain extent.

Associations between substance use, venous thromboembolism (VTE) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and its effects on LOS or mortality in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study identified risk factors associated with poor in-hospital outcomes among patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS: Case-control study was conducted of patients with prior diagnosis of HF hospitalised with COVID-19 at an academic tertiary care centre from 1 January 2020 to 28 February 2021. Patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 with risk factors were compared with those without risk factors for clinical characteristics, LOS and mortality. Multivariate regression was conducted to identify multiple predictors of increased LOS and in-hospital mortality in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19. RESULTS: Total of 211 patients with HF were hospitalised with COVID-19. Women had longer LOS than men (9 days vs 7 days; p<0.001). Compared with patients without PAD or ischaemic stroke, patients with PAD or ischaemic stroke had longer LOS (7 days vs 9 days; p=0.012 and 7 days vs 11 days, p<0.001, respectively). Older patients (aged 65 and above) had increased in-hospital mortality compared with younger patients (adjusted OR: 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.07; p=0.036). Prior diagnosis of VTE increased mortality more than threefold in patients with HF hospitalised with COVID-19 (adjusted OR: 3.33; 95% CI 1.29 to 8.43; p=0.011).

The recent outbreak in Wuhan (December 2019), China, represents a beta coronavirus classified as novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which belongs to the Coronaviridae family. Novel SARS-CoV-2 represents a significant similarity with previous coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV in 2002, China and MERS-CoV in 2015, Middle East. However, preliminary research investigations have shown the novel SARS-CoV-2 evolved with several mutations and developed the capacity to cross the species, i.e., animal to human. The initial findings have shown that spike proteins are vital molecules target hACE2 receptor for its attachment and entry into cells. After successful entry virus primarily focuses on respiratory airway cell lines and triggers a massive immune response leading to mucus generation. In severe conditions, the virus is capable of forcing viral pneumonia leading to the collapse of the respiratory system, i.e., COVID19. So far, there is a lack of immunity against the virus in humans. At the same in the absence of therapeutic interventions, many countries experienced high mortality, such as the United States, European countries, i.e., Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. The vaccine development is underway and experiencing challenges, as many reports demonstrated genetic variations in viral genome and proteins as well.

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) driven smartphone apps can help alleviate such issues, allowing for in situ recordings. Implementing such an app is not trivial, necessitates strict regulatory and legal requirements, and requires short development cycles to appropriately react to abrupt changes in the pandemic. Based on an existing app framework, we developed Corona Health, an app that serves as a platform for deploying questionnaire-based studies in combination with recordings of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present the technical details of Corona Health and provide first insights into the collected data. Through collaborative efforts from experts from public health, medicine, psychology, and computer science, we released Corona Health publicly on Google Play and the Apple App Store (in July, 2020) in 8 languages and attracted 7,290 installations so far. Currently, five studies related to physical and mental well-being are deployed and 17,241 questionnaires have been filled out. Corona Health proves to be a viable tool for conducting research related to the COVID-19 pandemic and can serve as a blueprint for future EMA-based studies.

However, iNATs can often generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false-positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false-negative results. Multiplex assays targeting different regions of the analyte and logical signal readout using sequence-specific probes can help to reduce both false negatives and false positives. Here, we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on a non-sequence-specific readout into individual and multiplex one-pot assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We describe both fluorescence-based and Boolean logic-gated colorimetric lateral flow readout methods and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.IMPORTANCE One of the key approaches to treatment and control of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, is accurate and rapid diagnostics that is widely deployable in a timely and scalable manner. To achieve this, it is essential to go beyond the traditional gold standard of quantitative PCR (qPCR) that is often faced with difficulties in scaling due to the complexity of infrastructure and human resource requirements. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), have been long pursued as ideal, low-tech alternatives for rapid, portable testing. However, isothermal approaches often suffer from false signals due to employment of nonspecific readout methods. We describe general principles for rapidly converting nonspecifically read LAMP assays into assays that are read in a sequence-specific manner by using oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes. We also demonstrate that inclusion of OSD probes in LAMP assays maintains the simplicity of one-pot assays and a visual yes/no readout by using fluorescence or colorimetric lateral-flow dipsticks while providing accurate sequence-specific readout and the ability to logically query multiplex amplicons for redundancy or copresence. These principles not only yielded high-surety isothermal assays for SARS-CoV-2 but might also aid in the design of more sophisticated molecular assays for other analytes.","Bhadra, Sanchita; Riedel, Timothy E; Lakhotia, Simren; Tran, Nicholas D; Ellington, Andrew D",MSphere,473,29

Heat-sensitive moxibustion was operated according to the required standard, 40 min to 60 min each time, once daily. Before and after moxibustion, the improvements in clinical symptoms were evaluated, such as chest oppression, poor appetite, lassitude and negative emotions. Results: (1) The number of cases and the incidence was 21 cases (50.0%), 24 cases (57.1%) and 26 cases (61.9%) for chest oppression, poor appetite and lassitude before heat-sensitive moxibustion. The number of cases was reduced to be 10 cases (23.8%), 7 cases (16.7%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 1st treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion for chest oppression, poor appetite, and lassitude. It was reduced to be 11 cases (26.2%), 8 cases (19.0%) and 4 cases (9.5%) after the 2nd treatment of moxibustion and it was reduced to be 18 cases (42.9%), 10 cases (23.8%) and 6 cases (14.3%) after the 3rd treatment of moxibustion. The incidences of the symptoms were all reduced obviously as compared with those before treatment. (2) Before treatment with heat-sensitive moxibustion, there were 24 cases of negative emotions (57.1%). It was reduced to be 16 cases (38.1%), 11 cases (26.2%) and 3 cases (7.1%) after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd treatment of heat-sensitive moxibustion successively.

Differential considerations for diseases involving primarily the perinephric space differ from those arising from the kidney itself, show variant imaging features, and require identification and characterisation by interpreting radiologists-an imaging diagnosis can be suggested in many cases. Lymphangiomas are congenital cystic lesions that may contain lipid-laden chyle, which may be detectable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Retroperitoneal fibrosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and lymphoma may present as a perinephric soft tissue rind. Osseous findings favour Erdheim-Chester, ureteric obstruction favours retroperitoneal fibrosis, and associated lymphadenopathy with mass-effect, but without invasion of adjacent structures favours lymphoma. Extramedullary haematopoiesis and brown fat stimulation are both characterised by signal drop on opposed-phase T1-weighted (W) images, the former resulting from severe anaemia and the latter in the context of elevated serum catecholamines, especially in the setting of phaeochromocytoma. Liposarcoma is the most common primary sarcoma of the retroperitoneum. Metastases are uncommon; however, they can be seen in melanoma, among other primary malignancies. Increased T1W signal hyperintensity is typical of melanoma metastases and haematomas. Abscesses show non-enhancing fluid centrally with marked diffusion restriction. This article presents a review of the perinephric space, pathological conditions of the perinephric space, and an approach towards imaging and diagnosis using cross-sectional imaging, with emphasis on MRI. MRI provides better tissue characterisation, assessment of enhancement kinetics, and detection of intralesional fat in comparison to CT.

Immunity generated after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is precarious, as indicated by real-world evidence in the form of epidemiological data from Manaus, Brazil. Vaccines using different platforms are therefore the most promising approach to help us return to normality. Although several vaccines have been authorized for emergency use, there are still many concerns regarding their accessibility, the vaccination rate, and most importantly, their efficacy in preventing infection with emerging virus variants. Continued virus surveillance and rapid redesign of new vaccines to counter new variants are crucial to fighting COVID-19.

The results could provide a basis for psychological health education of middle school students during major life events. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study used a survey to explore emotional resilience and learning management abilities in middle school students (N=896) from February 10, 2020, to March 22, 2020. Students used online e-learning during this period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using t-testing, Pearson's correlation, and multivariate linear regression. RESULTS The results indicate that emotional resilience was significantly lower in eighth grade students than in seventh grade students (t=1.98, P<0.05) and negative emotional recovery increased during the study period. Emotional resilience was positively correlated with learning management skills (r=0.498, P<0.01), and positive emotional ability predicted learning management skills. CONCLUSIONS The study findings indicate that in the face of major life events, emotional resilience is an important factor for the mental health of adolescents and improves coping ability. Cultivating positive emotions can improve learning efficiency.","Zhang, Qing; Zhou, Longjun; Xia, Jianping",Med Sci Monit,473,20

One of these, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), is a well-matched surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 because it is also a Betacoronavirus, targets the human respiratory system, is transmitted via respiratory aerosols and droplets and is relatively resistant to disinfectants. Unfortunately, growth of HCoV-OC43 in the recommended human colon cancer (HRT-18) cells does not produce obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) and its titration in these cells requires expensive antibody-based detection. Consequently, multiple quantification approaches for HCoV-OC43 using alternative cell lines exist, which complicates comparison of research results. Hence, we investigated the basic growth parameters of HCoV-OC43 infection in three of these cell lines (HRT-18, human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) and African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells) including the differential development of cytopathic effect (CPE) and explored reducing the cost, time and complexity of antibody-based detection assay. Multi-step growth curves were conducted in each cell type in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with daily sampling for seven days. Samples were quantified by tissue culture infectious dose50(TCID50)/ml or plaque assay (cell line dependent) and additionally analyzed on the Sartorius Virus Counter 3100 (VC), which uses flow virometry to count the total number of intact virus particles in a sample. We improved the reproducibility of a previously described antibody-based detection based TCID50 assay by identifying commercial sources for antibodies, decreasing antibody concentrations and simplifying the detection process. The growth curves demonstrated that HCoV-O43 grown in MRC-5 cells reached a peak titer of [~]107 plaque forming units/ml at two days post infection (dpi). In contrast, HCoV-OC43 grown on HRT-18 cells required six days to reach a peak titer of [~]106.5 TCID50/ml. HCoV-OC43 produced CPE in Vero E6 cells but these growth curve samples failed to produce CPE in a plaque assay after four days. Analysis of the VC data in combination with plaque and TCID50 assays together revealed that the defective:infectious virion ratio of MRC-5 propagated HCoV-OC43 was less than 3:1 for 1-6 dpi while HCoV-OC43 propagated in HRT-18 cells varied from 41:1 at 1 dpi, to 329:4 at 4 dpi to 94:1 at 7 dpi. These results should enable better comparison of extant HCoV-OC43 study results and prompt further standardization efforts.","Schirtzinger, Erin E.; Davis, A. Sally",,473,16

DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional study, we recruited English-language migrants (n = 411) living in Israel to respond to an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 3 April to 16 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The dependent variable comprised the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, which attained an internal consistency of 0.91 in this sample. RESULTS: PSS scores were related to lower age (p < 0.0001), being single (p = 0.0095), not possessing high (p = 0.0069) or medium resilience (p = 0.0002), reporting below average SES (p = 0.0196), being ""extremely"" worried about getting COVID-19 (p < 0.0001), and having high health literacy (p = 0.0007). Additionally, the interaction between health literacy and resilience (p < 0.0001) showed that migrants with high resilience and high health literacy had the lowest perceived stress; and migrants with low resilience and high health literacy had the highest perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions are needed to assist migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal intervention will aim to address the psychological distress while increasing both health literacy and resilience.","Zlotnick, Cheryl; Dryjanska, Laura; Suckerman, Suzanne",Psychol Health,473,26

In general, choroidal metastases respond favorably to systemic therapy targeted toward the primary neoplasm. In patients with choroidal metastasis of ALK rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), targeted therapy using Alk inhibitors gradually replaced radiotherapy as the best treatment. Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitors. Here we describe 2 clinical cases of patients with choroidal metastasis of ALK rearranged NSCLC who received Alectinib as first-line therapy achieving disease control and quality of life improvement. PATIENTS CONCERNS: In case report 1, 62-year-old man presented with scintillated scotomas at the level of the right eye; in case report 2, 69-year-old man presented with respiratory distress, persistent cough resistant to medical therapy, pain, and blurred vision. DIAGNOSES: In case report 1, fundus and ultrasonographic examination showed circumscribed choroid thickening with dome-like appearance compatible with repetitive lesion. Computed tomographic/y (CT) showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodular formations and adenocarcinoma of the lung was diagnosed by a transbronchial biopsy.In case report 2, CT showed a primary lesion of 36 × 27âmm in the middle lobe with bilateral lung metastases and lymphadenopathies. Multiple hepatic metastases and minor suspicious bone repetitions. A liver biopsy made a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma compatible with pulmonary primitiveness. An ocular fluoroangiography evidenced a left choroidal metastasis. INTERVENTIONS: Case report 1, 2, medical treatment with Alectinib 1200âmg/day was initiated. OUTCOMES: In case report 1, a few days after beginning the treatment, both systemic symptoms like respiratory distress and low vision were palliated. Reassessment by CT confirmed treatment response. In case report 2, clinically, visus disorders had already improved 2 weeks after beginning treatment. CT showed pulmonary, nodal, and hepatic response. Stability of bone metastases occurred after 2 months. In addition, ocular ultrasonography documented the regression of previously reported lesions confirmed treatment response. LESSONS: Alectinib works very well in intracranial metastases and is assumed to be so on the ocular ones as well, with benefit for the patient in quality of life.","Gozzi, Elisa; Angelini, Francesco; Rossi, Luigi; Leoni, Valentina; Trenta, Patrizia; Cimino, Giuseppe; Tomao, Silverio",Medicine (Baltimore),473,16

Estudos nacionais e internacionais têm investigado diferentes estratégias de enfrentamento, porém há um consenso de que pouco se conhece sobre a efetividades das ações, sendo a adesão ao tratamento uma das grandes dificuldades. Não foram encontrados estudos que buscam a opinião dos adolescentes sobre o tratamento para o uso de álcool e outras drogas como uma forma de repensar a efetividade das ações e a adesão ao tratamento. Objetivo geral: Compreender de forma compartilhada a opinião de adolescentes atendidos pelo Centro de Atenção Psicossocial Álcool e Drogas Adolescer de Cuiabá-MT e dos trabalhadores acerca da adesão ao tratamento para uso de álcool e outras drogas. Metodologia: Estudo estratégico que busca compreender problemas que surgem em ações governamentais ou na sociedade. A abordagem teórico-metodológica é a Hermenêutica-dialética que trabalha com a comunicação da vida cotidiana e do senso comum, pela qual o ser humano é histórico e complementa-se pela comunicação. Para a coleta dos dados, foram realizadas entrevistas individuais com os adolescentes que permaneceram maior tempo em tratamento e interromperam voluntariamente e grupo focal com os mesmos e com a equipe técnica.Foram utilizados os conceitos de necessidades, necessidades de saúde e vulnerabilidade. Resultados: Foram definidas sete formas de discutir a adesão. Fazendo uma analogia à expressão bicho de sete cabeças, os capítulos foram divididos em sete cabeças. A primeira cabeça se refere as razões apontadas para o uso de álcool e drogas, como um dos aspectos a ser considerado na proposta de tratamento; A segunda cabeça está relacionada com as dificuldades para buscar tratamento, destacando os fatores que podem interferir na adesão, como o grupo de pares e a estigmatização; A terceira cabeça discute o tratamento em si, destacando o vínculo com os profissionais; A quarta forma de diálogo se refere aos motivos para a interrupção do tratamento, como a influência do grupo de pares, a estigmatização e as questões econômicas; Na quinta cabeça estão as sugestões dos adolescentes para adesão ao tratamento, como as atividades na comunidade, o envolvimento do grupo de pares e da família no tratamento; A sexta cabeça discute o conceito de adesão e não adesão segundo os adolescentes e os trabalhadores, e as contradições e semelhanças entre eles; e como sétima e última cabeça, são apresentadas as considerações sobre a importância de trazer o sujeito adolescente para a formulação das políticas. Conclusões: Os dados mostraram a importância de realizar o cuidado entendendo que uma proposta não deve ser produto de um saber exclusivamente instrumental científico-tecnológico, mas sim algo construídocom os adolescentes e a partir deles, com suas próprias sabedorias práticas e instrumentais.

The differential equation model contains a set of coupled heteroclinic cycles forming a heteroclinic network. In this paper we carefully consider the dynamics near this heteroclinic network.

One surprisingly effective platform for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to share knowledge and experiences from the front lines has been social media (for example, the""#medtwitter""community on Twitter). However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis. Our method can aid in future public-health emergencies by facilitating knowledge transfer among healthcare workers in a rapidly-changing information environment, and by providing an efficient and unsupervised way of highlighting potential areas for clinical research.","Wu, Julia; Sivaraman, Venkatesh; Kumar, Dheekshita; Banda, Juan M.; Sontag, David",,473,24

This study seeks to analyse the efficacy and safety of DPIA in bronchiectasis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multi-centre study of historic cohorts. All the hospital centres in Spain were contacted in order to collect data on patients with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis who had taken at least one dose of DPIA. Its efficacy was analysed in clinical, functional and microbiological terms by comparing the year before and the year after the prescription of DPIA. Adverse effects and variables associated with these effects, or any need to withdraw the drug, were also analysed. RESULTS: 164 patients from 33 Spanish centres were included; 86% and 14% of these were treated with dry powder colistin and tobramycin, respectively. Chronic bronchial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in 86% of these patients, and DPIA significantly reduced the number of exacerbations, the quantity and purulence of sputum and the isolation of pathogenic microorganisms. The most common adverse effect was cough (40%), particularly in cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and a previous cough and in those patients who had difficulties in handling the device. These factors were associated with a higher level of withdrawal of the treatment. There were no serious adverse effects.

Sofía is a Mexican health care and technology startup that implemented an app-based telemedicine program during this pandemic in Mexico. Materials and Methods: The telemedicine program included on-demand video consultations with internal medicine specialists from March to September 2020. In the following study, we present a descriptive analysis of all the patients in the telemedicine program, called Coronaid. Results: 2,585 video consultations were conducted for a total of 1,545 patients and 44.4% of these were associated with respiratory symptoms. Of all patients, 46% were female and the mean age was 34 years, 52.2% were overweight or obese, and 25% presented at least one comorbid condition. Aside from respiratory complaints, the most common chief complaints were associated with gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and genitourinary symptoms. Patient satisfaction after video consultation services was >80%. Discussion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, an application-based telemedicine program had a high patient satisfaction rate in a significant sample of young patients, which can be attributed to the accessibility of the medical services and widespread use of smartphones in this patient demographic. Conclusion: Telemedicine has proven to be a useful, safe, and effective tool to improve patients' health, which has been boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of mobile applications and video consultation services can encourage patients to improve their health and prevent complications in the short and long terms.","Morgenstern-Kaplan, Dan; Rocha-Haro, Andrea; Canales-Albarrán, Sofía Jimena; Núñez-García, Edgar; León-Mayorga, Yasshid",Telemed. j. e. health,473,16

Unfortunately no treatment therapy or vaccine is yet available to counter the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which substantiates the need to expand research efforts in this direction. The indispensable function of the main protease in virus replication makes this enzyme a promising target for inhibitors screening and drug discovery to treat novel coronavirus infection. The recently concluded &#945;-ketoamide ligand-bound X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6Y2F) from Zhang et al. has revealed the potential inhibitor binding mechanism and the molecular determinants responsible for substrate binding. METHODS: For the study, we have targeted the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the screening of FDA approved antiviral drugs and carried out molecular docking based virtual screening. Further molecular dynamic simulation studies of the top three selected drugs carried out to investigated for their binding affinity and stability in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site. The phylogenetic analysis was also performed to know the relatedness between the SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from different countries. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals that the virus is closely related to the Bat-SL-CoV and does not exhibit any divergence at the genomic level. Molecular docking studies revealed that among the 77 drugs, screened top ten drugs shows good binding affinities, whereas the top three drugs: Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Tipranavir, and Raltegravir were undergone for molecular dynamics simulation studies for their conformational stability in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study among the library of FDA approved antiviral drugs, the top three inhibitors Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Tipranavir, and Raltegravir show the best molecular interaction with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. However, the in-vitro efficacy of the drug molecules screened in this study further needs to be corroborated by carrying out a biochemical and structural investigation.","Kumar, Yogesh; Singh, Harvijay; Patel, Chirag N",J Infect Public Health,473,20

A systems view of host response to infections provides opportunities for discovering sensitive and robust molecular diagnostics. METHODS: We combine blood transcriptomes from six independent datasets (n = 756) with a knowledge-based human protein-protein interaction network, identifies subnetworks capturing host response to each infection class, and derives common response cores separately for viral and bacterial infections. We subject the subnetworks to a series of computational filters to identify a parsimonious gene panel and a standalone diagnostic score that can be applied to individual samples. We rigorously validate the panel and the diagnostic score in a wide range of publicly available datasets and in a newly developed Bangalore-Viral Bacterial (BL-VB) cohort. FINDING: We discover a 10-gene blood-based biomarker panel (Panel-VB) that demonstrates high predictive performance to distinguish viral from bacterial infections, with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99) in eleven independent datasets (n = 898). We devise a new stand-alone patient-wise score (VB10) based on the panel, which shows high diagnostic accuracy with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.98) in 2996 patient samples from 56 public datasets from 19 different countries. Further, we evaluate VB10 in a newly generated South Indian (BL-VB, n = 56) cohort and find 97% accuracy in the confirmed cases of viral and bacterial infections. We find that VB10 is (a) capable of accurately identifying the infection class in culture-negative indeterminate cases, (b) reflects recovery status, and (c) is applicable across different age groups, covering a wide spectrum of acute bacterial and viral infections, including uncharacterized pathogens. We tested our VB10 score on publicly available COVID-19 data and find that our score detected viral infection in patient samples. INTERPRETATION: Our results point to the promise of VB10 as a diagnostic test for precise diagnosis of acute infections and monitoring recovery status. We expect that it will provide clinical decision support for antibiotic prescriptions and thereby aid in antibiotic stewardship efforts.

Emerging studies indicate possible associations between viral infections and neurodegenerative and neurobehavioural conditions including autism. Viral infection during critical periods of early in utero neurodevelopment may lead to increased risk of autism in the offspring. This review is aimed at highlighting the association between viral infections, including viruses similar to COVID-19, and the aetiology of autism. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Ovid/Medline, and Google Scholar database. Relevant search terms included ""rubella and autism"", ""cytomegalovirus and autism"", ""influenza virus and autism"", ""Zika virus and autism"", ""COVID-19 and autism"". Based on the search terms, a total of 141 articles were obtained and studies on infants or children with congenital or perinatal viral infection and autistic behaviour were evaluated. The possible mechanisms by which viral infections could lead to autism include direct teratogenic effects and indirect effects of inflammation or maternal immune activation on the developing brain. Brain imaging studies have shown that the ensuing immune response from these viral infections could lead to disruption of the development of brain regions and structures. Hence, long-term follow up is necessary for infants whose mothers report an inflammatory event due to viral infection at any time during pregnancy to monitor for signs of autism. Research into the role of viral infection in the development of ASD may be one avenue of improving ASD outcomes in the future. Early screening and diagnosis to detect, and maybe even prevent ASD are essential to reduce the burden of this condition.","Shuid, Ahmad Naqib; Jayusman, Putri Ayu; Shuid, Nazrun; Ismail, Juriza; Kamal Nor, Norazlin; Mohamed, Isa Naina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),473,9

However, there were only two previous case reports on newly diagnosed DM in COVID-19 patients. Here, we described three patients who had newly diagnosed DM associated with COVID-19.

METHODS: We performed a case series of all PWH sequentially admitted with COVID-19 from 8 March 2020 to 23 April 2020 at three hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia. Sociodemographic, clinical and HIV-associated characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Of 530 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized during this period, 20 occurred among PWH (3.8%). The median age was 57 (Q1-Q3, 48-62) years, 65% were men, and 85% were non-Hispanic Black. Presenting median symptom duration was 5 (Q1-Q3, 3-7) days; cough (90%), fever (65%), malaise (60%) and dyspnea (60%) were most common. On admission, 40% of patients required oxygenation support and 65% had an abnormal chest radiograph. Median length of hospitalization was 5 (Q1-Q3, 4-12) days, 30% required intensive care, 15% required intubation, and 15% died. Median CD4 cell count prior to admission was 425 (Q1-Q3, 262-815) cells/µl and 90% of patients had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/ml.

Originally this forum had 1 major role-education. The MMC evolved and a second key role was added: quality improvement. In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, a second evolution-one that will humanize the MMC-is required. The pandemic emphasizes the need to use MMCs not only as a place to discuss errors but also as a place for medical providers to reflect on lives lost. The authors' review of the literature regarding MMCs indicates that most studies focus on enabling MMCs to become a forum for quality improvement, while none have emphasized the need to humanize MMCs to decrease medical provider burnout and improve patient satisfaction. Permitting clinicians to be human on the job requires restructuring the MMC to provide a space for reflection and, ultimately, defining a new purpose and charge for the MMC. The authors have 3 main recommendations. First, principles of humanism such as compassion, empathy, and respect, in particular, should be incorporated into traditional MMCs. Second, shorter gatherings devoted to giving clinicians the opportunity to focus on their humanity could be arranged. Third, an MMC focused entirely on the human aspects of medical care could be periodically arranged to provide an outlet for storytelling, artistic expression, and reflection.

The results indicate that: (1) generally, both moral obligation and public leadership as well as their constituent indicators contributed positively to collective action for COVID-19 prevention and control; (2) moreover, moral obligation and public leadership can strengthen each other's positive role in collective action for COVID-19 prevention and control. Based on the above findings, this paper suggests that villagers' moral obligation can be perfected through internalizing epidemic prevention and control norms into the villagers' moral norms by the way of villagers mastering the rural public health governance scheme. In addition, public leadership can be improved through professional training of village cadres and by motivating village elites to run for village cadres. With improved villagers' moral obligation and village cadres' public leadership, collective action for epidemic prevention and control could be more likely to be realized.","Yang, Liu; Ren, Yang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),473,16

The objective of this study is to evaluate a mindfulness-based intervention for psychological distress among Chinese residents during COVID-19. Methods: This study used a switching replications design to test the feasibility and efficacy of a brief online mindfulness-based intervention for Chinese residents' psychological distress. Fifty-one residents in the Hubei province were randomly allocated to two groups (experimental group and waitlist control group) with three waves of measurement at time 1, time 2, and time 3 for changes in mindfulness and psychological distress. Results: In addition to significant within-group improvements over time for both groups, OLS linear regression with full information likelihood estimation revealed statistically significant between-group treatment effects across outcome domains, including mindfulness awareness, b = 2.84, p < 0.001, g = 6.92, psychological distress, b = -21.33, p < 0.001, g = 6.62, somatic symptoms, b = -6.22, p < 0.001, g = 4.42, depressive symptoms, b = -7.16, p < 0.001, g = 5.07, and anxiety symptoms, b = -8.09, p < 0.001, g = 6.84.

'Lockdowns' and restrictive measures, especially, have complicated service provision and access, and disrupted key supply chains. Such interventions, alongside more traditional public health measures, interact with baseline health, health system, and social and economic vulnerabilities in LMICs to compound negative impacts. This analysis, based on a rapid evidence assessment by the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform in mid-2020, highlights the drivers and evidence of these impacts, emphasises the additional vulnerabilities experienced by marginalised social groups, and provides insight for governments, agencies, organisations and communities to implement more proportionate, appropriate, comprehensive and socially just responses that address COVID-19 in the context of and alongside other disease burdens. In the short term, there is an urgent need to monitor and mitigate impacts of pandemic responses on health service provision, access and use, including through embedding COVID-19 response within integrated health systems approaches. These efforts should also feed into longer-term strategies to strengthen health systems, expand universal healthcare coverage and attend to the social determinants of health-commitments, both existing and new-which governments, donors and international agencies must make and be held accountable to. Crucially, affected communities must be empowered to play a central role in identifying health priorities, allocating resources, and designing and delivering services.","Hrynick, Tabitha A; Ripoll Lorenzo, Santiago; Carter, Simone E",,473,29

This research uses descriptive qualitative methods, conducted by interviewing 15 mathematics teachers and observations made to 10 junior high school students. Based on the results of interviews with mathematics teachers, it is found that learning in online classes is very different from learning in class both in terms of student attendance, student learning outcomes, and student activities in the online learning process. Meanwhile, from the results of direct observation with students, it was found that students felt bored and did not understand the material in online classes due to a lack of time to ask questions about teaching materials and absence in online classes partly due to inadequate facilities.","Ishak, H.; Sukestiyarno, Y.

However, we observe diversified schema changes in heterogeneous data and open data, most of which has no schema defined. In this work, we propose to use deep learning to automatically deal with schema changes through a super cell representation and automatic injection of perturbations to the training data to make the model robust to schema changes.

The solution is tested on benchmarks with realistic sizes and parameters, on three scenarios for the target length on 5-day scheduling, common in small-medium sized hospitals, and results show that ASP is a suitable solving methodology for the ORS problem in such setting. Then, we also performed a scalability analysis on the schedule length up to 15 days, which still shows the suitability of our solution also on longer plan horizons. Moreover, we also present an ASP solution for the rescheduling problem, i.e. when the off-line schedule cannot be completed for some reason.

The study objectives were to describe guideline adherence and understand reasons for variation in EoE practice among pediatric gastroenterologists following publication of the updated 2018 international EoE guidelines. METHODS: We developed and administered a 28-item survey to pediatric gastroenterologists via an email listserv using the PEDGI Bulletin Board from 03/2019 to 04/2019. The survey was developed using evidence-based review, expert validation, and cognitive interviews. Survey domains included respondent knowledge of and adherence to published guidelines, diagnostic and management approach and rationale, and participant demographics. Analysis included descriptive statistics and tests for association. RESULTS: A total of 288 pediatric gastroenterologists completed the survey, most of whom practiced in an academic center (73%). More than half (63%) reported knowledge of the 2018 updated guidelines; however, only 52% agreed with them and 50% reported adherence. Respondents who reported not agreeing with updated guidelines cited concerns regarding increasing number of endoscopies (72%), misdiagnosing eosinophilia from reflux (56%), and insufficient data (23%). The most common drivers of decision making with respect to therapy choice were patient/family preference, evidence/guidelines, and symptom burden. CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians are not adherent to current guidelines for reasons which include lack of knowledge of updated guidelines and concern regarding the strength of the supporting evidence.

Here, we analyze the temporal changes in human mobility behavior, social contact rates, and their correlations with the transmissibility of COVID-19, using mobility data collected from more than 200K anonymized mobile phone users in Tokyo. The analysis concludes that by April 15th (1 week into state of emergency), human mobility behavior decreased by around 50%, resulting in a 70% reduction of social contacts in Tokyo, showing the strong relationships with non-compulsory measures. Furthermore, the reduction in data-driven human mobility metrics showed correlation with the decrease in estimated effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in Tokyo. Such empirical insights could inform policy makers on deciding sufficient levels of mobility reduction to contain the disease.","Yabe, Takahiro; Tsubouchi, Kota; Fujiwara, Naoya; Wada, Takayuki; Sekimoto, Yoshihide; Ukkusuri, Satish V",Sci Rep,473,1

METHODS: Thirty-five (35) newspapers, media websites, and current affairs magazines were sourced for the study: 8 for Australia, 12 for the UK, and 15 for the United States. Searches were conducted daily from April-June 2020, using key words to identify age-related themes on pandemic control. RESULTS: Despite divergent policies in the three countries, ageism took similar forms. Public responses to lockdowns and other measures cast older adults as a problem to be ignored or solved through segregation. Name-calling, blame, and ""so-be-it"" reactions towards age vulnerability were commonplace. Policies banning visits to aged care homes angered many relatives and older adults. Indefinite isolation for older adults was widely accepted, especially as a vehicle to end public lockdowns and economic crises. DISCUSSION: Older adults have and will continue to bear the brunt of Covid-19 in terms of social burdens and body counts as the pandemic continues to affect people around the globe. The rhetoric of disposability underscores age discrimination on a broader scale, with blame towards an age cohort considered to have lived past its usefulness for society and to have enriched itself at the expense of future generations.","Lichtenstein, Bronwen",,473,3

The development of decision support tools for real-time clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is of prime importance to assist patients' triage and allocate resources for patients at risk. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 2 to June 15, 2020, clinical patterns of COVID-19 suspected patients at admission to the EDs of Liège University Hospital, consisting in the recording of eleven symptoms (i.e. dyspnoea, chest pain, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, dry cough, wet cough, diarrhoea, headache, myalgia, fever and anosmia) plus age and gender, were investigated during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Indeed, 573 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by qRT-PCR before mid-June 2020, and 1579 suspected cases that were subsequently determined to be qRT-PCR negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in this study. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, two most relevant symptoms of COVID-19 were identified in addition of the age of the patient, i.e. fever (odds ratio [OR] = 3.66; 95% CI: 2.97-4.50), dry cough (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.39-2.12), and patients older than 56.5 y (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.67-2.58). Two additional symptoms (chest pain and sore throat) appeared significantly less associated to the confirmed COVID-19 cases with the same OR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56-0.94). An overall pondered (by OR) score (OPS) was calculated using all significant predictors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68-0.73) rendering the use of the OPS to discriminate COVID-19 confirmed and unconfirmed patients. The main predictors were confirmed using both sensitivity analysis and classification tree analysis. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation was observed between the OPS and the cycle threshold (Ct values) of the qRT-PCR. CONCLUSION AND MAIN SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed approach allows for the use of an interactive and adaptive clinical decision support tool. Using the clinical algorithm developed, a web-based user-interface was created to help nurses and clinicians from EDs with the triage of patients during the second COVID-19 wave.","Saegerman, Claude; Gilbert, Allison; Donneau, Anne-Françoise; Gangolf, Marjorie; Diep, Anh Nguvet; Meex, Cécile; Bontems, Sébastien; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; D039,; Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",PLoS One,473,26

Nevertheless, little has been published on the factors differentiating MIS-C from other conditions in the acute care setting. We investigated differences in presentation and laboratory studies between suspected versus confirmed MIS-C patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study on patients 21 years or younger undergoing investigation for possible MIS-C at a single institution between April 21 and July 1, 2020. The primary outcome was diagnosis of MIS-C or an alternative final diagnosis. Clinical features and laboratory findings from initial presentation were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients (median, 4 years; 55.7% male) were included, of whom 17 (16%) of 106 met the criteria for MIS-C. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children patients were significantly more likely to report a coronavirus disease 2019 exposure (odds ratio (OR), 13.17 [3.87-44.9]), have gastrointestinal symptoms (OR, 3.81 [1.02-14.19]), and have a significantly higher odds of having abnormal laboratory values including high-sensitivity troponin T (OR, 13 [4.0-42.2]), N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (OR, 8.4 [2.3-30.1]), D-dimer (OR, 13 [1.6-103]), and ferritin (OR, 7.8 [2.2-27.2]). There were also differences between groups in inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (median, 134.45 mg/L vs 12.6 mg/L; P < 0.05) and procalcitonin (1.71 ng/mL vs 0.14 ng/mL; P < 0.001).

The toughest issue traumatic orthopaedic surgeons are faced with is how to maintain a balance between adequate COVID-19 screening and timely surgery. In this study, we described our experience with pre-operative COVID-19 screening in patients with traumatic fractures. Furthermore, we analysed the clinical results of fracture patients undergoing confined or emergency surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This was a case series study. Patients with traumatic fractures who were admitted to our hospital for surgery were enrolled in this study during the COVID-19 outbreak from March to April 2020. All patients were enrolled and managed using the standardized clinical pathway we designed for preoperative COVID-19 screening. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were analysed. RESULTS: The average surgery waiting time from injury to surgery was 8.7 ± 3.4 days. The average waiting time from admission to surgery was 5.3 ± 2.8 days. These average waiting times were increased by 4.1 days and 2.0 days, respectively, compared with 2019 data. Cardiovascular complications, venous thromboembolism and pneumonia occurred in one, two and one patient, respectively. Three and two patients developed pre-operative and postoperative fevers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a novel clinical pathway for pre-operatively screening of COVID-19 in traumatic orthopaedic patients. The delay in surgery caused by COVID-19 screening was minimized to a point at which reasonable and acceptable clinical outcomes were achieved. Doctors should pay more attention to perioperative complications, such as cardiovascular complications, venous thromboembolism, pneumonia and fever.","Meng, Yutong; Leng, Kunpeng; Shan, Lei; Guo, Meng; Zhou, Junlin; Tian, Qingxian; Hai, Yong",Int Orthop,473,20

Objectives. 1) To describe the baseline characteristics and outcomes of the initial cohort of COVID-19 patients in the medical ICU. 2) To report the initial situation and strategies in the ICU during the first two months of being a COVID-19 referral center. Methods. We conducted a review of records of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the medical ICU of UP-PGH between April 1 to May 31, 2020. Patient demographics, comorbidities, APACHE-II score, signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiologic results, respiratory and vasopressor support, and outcomes were collected. Results. Out of 35 patients with confirmed COVID-19, majority were above 60 years old (63%). Hypertension was the most frequent comorbidity (77%). Fever was the most common symptom (51%). The mean duration of symptoms prior admission was 9 ± 7 days. Anemia and leukocytosis with neutrophilia was common. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) were elevated in most patients. Majority of patients (66%) had moderate level of hypoxemia on admission. Bilateral pneumonia on chest radiograph was found in 34 patients. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were the most commonly used drugs. A total of 24 patients (69%) required invasive mechanical ventilation while 15 (43%) needed pressor support. Twenty-two expired (63%) while thirteen (37%) patients were discharged from the medical ICU. Conclusion.

In times of scarcity, patient prioritization based on non-medical considerations might be necessary. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to pilot test a survey to elicit public opinions on the relative importance of non-medical considerations in priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU in times of crisis. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment was used to collect social preferences for priority setting when admitting patients to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The six attributes were patient age, profession, guardianship, risk-conscious behavior on a societal level, health-conscious behavior, and expected ICU length of stay. The data were analyzed using a mixed multinomial logit model. Interactions between the age and profession of the respondents and the age and profession of the patient profiles were considered. RESULTS: The mean (± standard deviation) age of respondents was 35.9 ± 14.5 years. In all, 70% of respondents indicated that medical and/or non-medical considerations should play a role in prioritizing patients for the ICU, whereas 15% agreed with a ""first come, first served"" strategy and the remaining 15% had no opinion. Respondents deemed risk-conscious behavior on a societal level to be the most important non-medical factor that should be used to prioritize patients in phase three of the framework, garnering an attribute importance (AI) of 31.2%, followed by patient age (AI 16.3%) and health-conscious behavior (AI 16.0%). ICU length of stay had the lowest impact on patient prioritization for ICU admittance (AI 10.9%). Younger and older respondents attached more importance to age than respondents in the middle age group and indicated a stronger preference to prioritize patients in their own age group (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrate the relative importance members of the public attach to responsible societal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the next phase of the study, we will elicit the perspectives of a representative sample of the Dutch population. Changes to the task design and attribute operationalization could improve the external validity of the study findings, and optimization of the experimental design will improve the internal validity of the study.","Gijsbers, Merle; Keizer, Iris Elise; Schouten, Stephanie Else; Trompert, Janneke Louise; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G M; van Til, Janine Astrid",Patient,473,15

METHODS: A total of 587 subjects (517 patients/70 healthy controls) were enrolled in the study.The patients were categorized into the groups regarding to the severity of disease (mild, moderate, severe, and critical).Thiol status of all groups were compared. RESULTS: The patients had significantly diminished thiol levels compared to controls.Thiol levels were gradually decreased as the severity of the disease increased.Logistic regression analyses identified that thiol concentrations were an independent risk factor for the disease severity in each phase (mild group OR 0.975, 95%CI 0.965-0.986; moderate group, OR 0.964, 95%CI 0.953-0.976; severe group OR 0.953, 95%CI 0.941-0.965; critical group OR 0.947, 95%CI 0.935-0.960).Thiol test exhibited the largest area under the curve at 0.949, with the highest sensitivity (98.6%) and specificity (80.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Depleted thiol status was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.Decline of the thiol levels by degrees while the severity of infection increased was closely related to the progression of the disease.This outcome highlights that thiols could be an impressible biomarker for predicting of the severity of COVID-19.

Objective: To evaluate immune persistence of two priming doses of CoronaVac, and immunogenicity and safety of a third dose in healthy adults [≥]60 years. Design, setting, and participants: We conducted a vaccine booster study built on a single-center, randomized, double-blind phase 1/2 trial of the two-dose schedule of CoronaVac among healthy adults[≥]60 years in Hebei, China. We examined neutralizing antibody titres six months or more after the second dose in all participants. We provided a third dose to 303 participants recruited in phase 2 trial to assess their immune responses. InterventionsTwo formulations (3 g, and 6 g) were used in phase 1 trial, and an additional formulation of 1.5 g was used in phase 2 trial. All participants were given two doses 28 days apart and followed up 6 months after the second dose. Participants in phase 2 received a third dose 8 months after the second dose. Main outcomes and measuresGeometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 and adverse events were assessed at multiple time points following vaccination. ResultsNeutralizing antibody titres dropped below the seropositive cutoff of 8 at 6 months after the primary vaccination in all vaccine groups in the phase 1/2 trial. A third dose given 8 months or more after the second dose significantly increased neutralizing antibody levels. In the 3 g group (the licensed formulation), GMT increased to 305 [95%CI 215.3-432.0] on day 7 following the third dose, an approximately 7-fold increase compared with the GMT 28 days after the second dose. All solicited adverse reactions reported within 28 days after a booster dose were of grade 1 or 2 severity. Conclusion and relevanceNeutralizing antibody titres declined substantially six months after two doses of CoronaVac among older adults. A booster dose rapidly induces robust immune responses.

METHODS: All consecutive COVID-19 adult patients admitted between March and June 2020 to the ICU of a referral, university hospital in Northern-Italy were enrolled. MR-proADM and routine laboratory test were measured within 48 hours from ICU admission, on day 3, 7 and 14. Survival curves difference with MR-proADM cut-off set to 1.8 nmol/L were tested using log-rank test. Predictive ability was compared using area under the curve and 95% confidence interval of different receiver-operating characteristics curves. RESULTS: 57 patients were enrolled. ICU and overall mortality were 54.4%. At admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 86% of patients; increased D-dimer and CRP levels were found in 84.2% and 87.7% of patients respectively, while PCT values > 0.5 µg/L were observed in 47.4% of patients. MR-proADM, CRP and LDH were significantly different between surviving and non-surviving patients and over time, while PCT, D-dimer and NT-pro-BNP did not show any difference between the groups and over time; lymphocytes were different between surviving and non-surviving patients only. MR-proADM was higher in dying patients (2.65±2.33vs1.18±0.47, p<0.001) and a higher mortality characterized patients with MR-proADM >1.8 nmol/L (p = 0.016). The logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and PCT values confirmed an odds ratio = 10.3 [95%CI:1.9-53.6] (p = 0.006) for MR-proADM >1.8 nmol/L and = 22.2 [95%CI:1.6-316.9] (p = 0.022) for cardiovascular disease. Overall, MR-proADM had the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.85 [95%CI:0.78-0.90]). CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 ICU-patients, MR-proADM seems to have constantly higher values in non-survivor patients and predict mortality more precisely than other biomarkers. Repeated MR-proADM measurement may support a rapid and effective decision-making. Further studies are needed to better explain the mechanisms responsible of the increase in MR-proADM in COVID-19 patients.","Montrucchio, Giorgia; Sales, Gabriele; Rumbolo, Francesca; Palmesino, Filippo; Fanelli, Vito; Urbino, Rosario; Filippini, Claudia; Mengozzi, Giulio; Brazzi, Luca",PLoS One,473,24

Current methods for evaluation of antibacterial treatments in clinics and in vitro systems used in drug development and screening either do not facilitate biofilm formation or are cumbersome to operate, need large reagent volumes and are costly, limiting their usability. To address these issues, this work presents the development of a robust in vitro cell culture platform compatible with confocal microscopy. The platform shaped as a compact disc, facilitates long term bacterial culture without external pumps and tubing and can be operated for several days without additional liquid handling. As an example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm is grown from single cells and it is shown that: 1) the platform delivers reproducible and reliable results; 2) growth is dependent on flow rate and growth medium composition; and 3) effi-cacy of antibiotic treatment depends on the formed biofilm. This platform enables biofilm growth, quantification and treatment as in a conventional flow setup, while decreasing the application barrier of lab-on-chip systems. It provides an easy-to-use, affordable option for end users working with cell culturing in relation to e.g. diagnostics and drug screening.","Serioli, Laura; Laksafoss, Trygvi Zachariassen; Haagensen, Janus A Juul; Sternberg, Claus; Soerensen, Mads Peter; Molin, Soren; Zór, Kinga; Boisen, Anja",Anal. chem,473,29

However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics are highly heterogeneous and exhibit localized bursts of transmission, which may lead to sharp localized peaks in the number of new cases, often followed by longer periods of low incidence. Here we show that, for interim estimates of VE, these characteristic bursts in SARS-CoV-2 infection may introduce a strong positive bias in VE. Specifically, we generate null models of vaccine effectiveness, i.e., random models with bursts that over longer periods converge to zero VE but that for interim periods frequently produce apparent VE near 100%. As an example, by following the relevant clinical trial protocol, we can reproduce recently reported interim outcomes from an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of an RNA-based vaccine candidate. Thus, to avoid potential random biases in VE, it is suggested that interim estimates on COVID-19 VE should control for the intrinsic inhomogeneity in both SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and reported cases.","Lisewski, Andreas Martin",Int J Infect Dis,473,9

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From March 16, the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals began telephone consultations. Due to the disparity in the actions of the different department members, the decision was made to create a protocol to manage these consultations which started to be implemented March 23. RESULTS: During the study period, 1054 patients were attended in the consultations of both departments; 663 (62.9%) were first visits and 391 (37.10%) were successive visits. Twenty-one percent (229) of the consultations could be resolved by telephone, 10.82% (114) required face-to-face care, 57.40% (605) were indicated for an on-demand check-up depending on their disease course, and 10.05% (106) of the patients could not be reached by telephone. DISCUSSION: The state of alarm caused by COVID-19 has been a determining factor in how we undertake our care work. In the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals we decided to carry out consultations by telephone as an alternative to the traditional consultation. During this period, we have observed that up to 21.73% of the consultations could be dealt with by telephone. CONCLUSION: The telephone consultation seems to be a very useful tool to attend our patients avoiding the risk of COVID-19 infection during the state of alarm. Furthermore, according to the data analysed and the different studies, it seems a good alternative to the traditional consultation in selected patients.","Gómez González, María Del Rosario; Piqueras Pérez, Francisco M; Guillamón Vivancos, Laura; Galindo Iñiguez, Lorena; Jara Maquilón, Alejandra; Martínez Alonso, Jesús Aaron",Acta otorrinolaringol. esp,473,2

We aimed to assess and directly compare outcomes and risk predictors at time of emergency department (ED) presentation in COVID-19 and controls. Consecutive patients presenting to the ED with suspected COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled. COVID-19-patients were compared with (i) patients tested negative (overall controls) and (ii) patients tested negative, who had a respiratory infection (respiratory controls). Primary outcome was the composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death at 30 days. Among 1081 consecutive cases, 191 (18%) were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 890 (82%) were tested negative (overall controls), of which 323 (30%) had a respiratory infection (respiratory controls). Incidence of the composite outcome was significantly higher in COVID-19 (23%) as compared with the overall control group (10%, adjusted-HR 2.45 (95%CI,1.61–3.74), p &lt;0.001) or the respiratory control group (10%, adjusted-HR 2.93 (95%CI,1.66–5.17), p &lt;0.001). Blood oxygen saturation, age, high-sensitivity troponin, c-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase were identified as the strongest predictors of poor outcome available at time of ED presentation in COVID-19 with highly comparable prognostic utility in overall and respiratory controls. In conclusion, patients presenting to the ED with COVID-19 have a worse outcome than controls, even after adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics. Most predictors of poor outcome in COVID-19 were not restricted to COVID-19, but of comparable prognostic utility in controls and therefore generalizable to unselected patients with suspected COVID-19.","Lampart, Maurin Rüegg Marco Jauslin Andrea S.; Simon, Noemi R.; Zellweger, Núria Eken Ceylan Tschudin-Sutter Sarah Bassetti Stefano Rentsch Katharina M.; Siegemund, Martin Bingisser Roland Nickel Christian H.; Osswald, Stefan Kuster Gabriela M.; Twerenbold, Raphael",Journal of Clinical Medicine,473,33

METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study of children presenting to an ED with respiratory complaints in Nepal was conducted. It included all children under 5 years of age with cough or difficulty breathing who received a chest radiograph. Paediatric pneumonia was diagnosed according to WHO criteria when a child presented with a cough or difficulty breathing and met the age-related WHO-defined respiratory rate for tachypnoea. The criterion standard was radiographic pneumonia. The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of the WHO criteria for diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of 324 patients enrolled, 72 had radiographic pneumonia. The median (IQR) age was 17 (23) months. Overall, WHO criteria had a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI 59-81) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 50-63). Respiratory rate had poor diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia with an area under the curve of 0.65.

In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients. (1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test. (2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. (3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.","Neri, Emanuele; Miele, Vittorio; Coppola, Francesca; Grassi, Roberto",Radiol Med,473,24

This study attempted to devise a comprehensive protocol regarding dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS AND RESULT: Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched until March 2020 for relevant papers. Sixteen English papers were enrolled to answer questions about procedures that are allowed to perform during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients who are in priority to receive dental care services, the conditions and necessities for patient admission, waiting room and operatory room, and personal protective equipment (PPE) that is necessary for dental clinicians and the office staff. CONCLUSION: Dental treatment should be limited to patients with urgent or emergency situation. By screening questionnaires for COVID-19, patients are divided into three groups of (a) apparently healthy, (b) suspected for COVID-19, and (c) confirmed for COVID-19. Separate waiting and operating rooms should be assigned to each group of patients to minimize the risk of disease transmission. All groups should be treated with the same protective measures with regard to PPE for the dental clinicians and staff.","Falahchai, Mehran; Babaee Hemmati, Yasamin; Hasanzade, Mahya",Spec Care Dentist,473,24

We explore queer concerns in privacy, censorship, language, online safety, health, and employment to study the positive and negative effects of artificial intelligence on queer communities. These issues underscore the need for new directions in fairness research that take into account a multiplicity of considerations, from privacy preservation, context sensitivity and process fairness, to an awareness of sociotechnical impact and the increasingly important role of inclusive and participatory research processes. Most current approaches for algorithmic fairness assume that the target characteristics for fairness--frequently, race and legal gender--can be observed or recorded. Sexual orientation and gender identity are prototypical instances of unobserved characteristics, which are frequently missing, unknown or fundamentally unmeasurable. This paper highlights the importance of developing new approaches for algorithmic fairness that break away from the prevailing assumption of observed characteristics.","Tomasev, Nenad; McKee, Kevin R.; Kay, Jackie; Mohamed, Shakir",,473,16

This evolution is driven by the enormous virus population, that has infected close to 200 million people by now. Therefore, cost effective and scalable methods are needed to monitor viral evolution globally. Mutation-specific PCR approaches have become inadequate to distinguish the variety of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and are unable to detect novel ones. Conversely, whole genome sequencing protocols remain too labor- and cost-intensive to monitor SARS-CoV-2 at the required density. By adapting SARSeq we present a simple, fast, and scalable S-gene tiling pipeline for focused sequencing of the S-gene encoding for the spike protein. This method reports on all sequence positions with known importance for infectivity and immunity, yet scales to >20K samples per run. S-gene tiling is used for nationwide surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at a density of 10% to 50% of all cases of infection in Austria. SARSeq S-tiling uncovered several infection clusters with variants of concern such as the biggest known cluster of Beta/B.1.351 outside Africa and successfully informed public health measures in a timely manner, allowing their successful implementation. Our close monitoring of mutations further highlighted evolutionary constraints and freedom of the spike protein ectodomain and sheds light on foreseeable evolutionary trajectories.","Özkan, Ezgi; Strobl, Marcus Martin; Novatchkova, Maria; Yelagandula, Ramesh; Albanese, Tanino Giuseppe; Triska, Petr; Endler, Lukas; Penz, Thomas; Patocka, Timothej; Felsenstein, Vera; Vogt, Alexander; Tamir, Ido; Seitz, Tamara; Foedinger, Manuela; Herwig, Ralf; Indra, Alexander; Schmid, Daniela; Bock, Christoph; Bergthaler, Andreas; Stark, Alexander; Allerberger, Franz; Elling, Ulrich; Cochella, Luisa",,473,1

Data were preprocessed and analyzed using the difference between number of deaths/million between 2 regions and the difference between the percentage of staying at home. The analysis was performed using linear regression with special attention to residual analysis. After preprocessing the data, 87 regions around the world were included, yielding 3741 pairwise comparisons for linear regression analysis. Only 63 (1.6%) comparisons were significant.

Here, we assessed the magnitude, function and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) co-infected) and 38 non-COVID-19 patients, using flow cytometry. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, associates with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB co-infection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1 mediated CD4 T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression. There results corroborate the important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis and support the concept of altered T cell functions in patients with severe disease.","Riou, Catherine; Du Bruyn, Elsa; Stek, Cari; Daroowala, Remy; Goliath, Rene T; Abrahams, Fatima; Said-Hartley, Qonita; Allwood, Brian W; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan; Wilkinson, Katalin A; Lindestam Arlehamn, Cecilia S; Sette, Alessandro; Wasserman, Sean; Wilkinson, Robert J",J. clin. invest,473,16

AIMS: This review seeks to gather and distill the existing body of literature that describes the cardiac implications of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The English literature was reviewed for papers dealing with the cardiac effects of COVID-19. RESULTS: Notably, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are counted in greater frequency in intensive care unit settings, and ultimately suffer greater rates of mortality. Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction. In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels. With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients. Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice. CONCLUSION: While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.","Aghagoli, Ghazal; Gallo Marin, Benjamin; Soliman, Luke B; Sellke, Frank W",J Card Surg,473,1

While previous studies concluded that shared rides can offer substantial benefits, initial evidence suggests low adoption levels. We postulate that previous studies that investigated the potential of ride-pooling failed to account for the trade-off that users are likely to make when considering a shared ride. We address this shortcoming by formulating user net benefit stemming from sharing as a compensatory function where the additional travel time and on-board discomfort need to be compensated by the price discount for a traveller to choose a shared ride over a private ride. The proposed formulation is embedded in a method for matching travel requests and vehicles. We conduct a series of experiments investigating how the potential of ride-pooling services depends on travel demand characteristics, user preferences and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider. In particular, the impact of various behavioural settings in terms of users' willingness to share their ride and delay aversion on service adoption and its operational efficiency is assessed. Our results suggest that the total vehicle mileage savings found by previous studies is only attainable when users are very willing to share their ride (i.e. attach low premium to private rides) and are offered a 50% discount for doing so. We find ride-pooling transportation distance savings as low as 15% in less favourable behavioural scenarios.","Ruijter, Arjan de; Cats, Oded; Alonso-Mora, Javier; Hoogendoorn, Serge",,473,1

This study aimed to explore the role of companion animals and attachment to pets in the context of the pandemic. We used longitudinal quantitative survey data collected prior to and during the pandemic to assess the role of pets in predicting adolescent loneliness. Pet ownership was not a significant predictor of loneliness before the pandemic, but did predict higher levels of loneliness during COVID-19 as well as higher increases in loneliness from before to during the pandemic. Dog ownership predicted lower levels of loneliness prior to, but not during the pandemic, and dog owners were significantly more attached to their pets than non-dog pet owners. Adolescents with pets reported spending more time with their pets during the pandemic, and frequently reported pet interactions as a strategy for coping with stress. Overall, the results from this study did not support the presence of a buffering effect of companion animals on loneliness for adolescents and indicate complexity in the relationships between pet ownership, attachment, loneliness, and coping with stress. These results suggest a need for additional research further assessing how features of the relationship such as species and relationship quality might contribute to adolescent mental health outcomes.","Mueller, Megan K; Richer, Amanda M; Callina, Kristina S; Charmaraman, Linda",,473,14

These restrictive measures have an enormous impact on residents' well-being and pose dilemmas for staff, although primary data are lacking. A Dutch guideline was developed to cautiously open nursing homes for visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports the first findings on how the guideline was applied in the local context; the compliance to local protocols; and the impact on well-being of residents, their family caregivers, and staff. DESIGN: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 26 nursing homes were permitted to enlarge their possibilities for allowing visitors in their facility. These nursing homes were proportionally representative of the Netherlands as they were selected by their local Area Health Authority for participation. At each nursing home, a contact person was selected for participation in the current study. METHODS: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted, consisting of questionnaire, telephone interviews, analyses of documentation (ie, local visiting protocols), and a WhatsApp group. RESULTS: Variation in local protocols was observed, for example, related to the use of personal protective equipment, location, and supervision of visits. In general, experiences were very positive. All nursing homes recognized the added value of real and personal contact between residents and their loved ones and indicated a positive impact on well-being. Compliance with local guidelines was sufficient to good. No new COVID-19 infections were reported during this time. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate the value of family visitation in nursing homes and positive impact of visits. Based on these results, the Dutch government has decided to allow all nursing homes in the Netherlands to cautiously open their homes using the guidelines. More research is needed on impact and long-term compliance.","Verbeek, Hilde; Gerritsen, Debby L; Backhaus, Ramona; de Boer, Bram S; Koopmans, Raymond T C M; Hamers, Jan P H",J Am Med Dir Assoc,473,16

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and prognostication of monocyte distribution width (MDW) in sepsis for patients admitted to ICU. METHODS: Between January and June 2020, we conducted a prospective observational study during the hospitalization of 506 adult patients admitted to the ICU. MDW was evaluated in 2,367 consecutive samples received for routine complete blood counts (CBC) performed once a day and every day during the study. Sepsis was diagnosed according to Sepsis-3 criteria and patients enrolled were classified in the following groups: no sepsis, sepsis and septic shock. RESULTS: MDW values were significantly higher in patients with sepsis or septic shock in comparison to those within the no sepsis group [median 26.23 (IQR: 23.48-29.83); 28.97 (IQR: 21.27-37.21); 21.99 (IQR: 19.86-24.36) respectively]. ROC analysis demonstrated that AUC is 0.785 with a sensitivity of 66.88% and specificity of 77.79% at a cut-off point of 24.63. In patients that developed an ICU-acquired sepsis MDW showed an increase from 21.33 [median (IQR: 19.47-21.72)] to 29.19 [median (IQR: 27.46-31.47)]. MDW increase is not affected by the aetiology of sepsis, even in patients with COVID-19. In sepsis survivors a decrease of MDW values were found from the first time to the end of their stay [median from 29.14 (IQR: 26.22-32.52) to 25.67 (IQR: 22.93-30.28)]. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU, MDW enhances the sepsis detection and is related to disease severity.","Piva, Elisa; Zuin, Jenny; Pelloso, Michela; Tosato, Francesca; Fogar, Paola; Plebani, Mario",Clin. chem. lab. med,473,22

Much information about the interplay between viruses and cell proliferation and metabolism has come from the history of clinical cases of patients infected with virus-induced cancer. In addition, information from viruses used to treat some types of cancer is valuable. Now, since the global coronavirus pandemic erupted almost a year ago, the scientific community has invested countless time and resources to slow down the infection rate and diminish the number of casualties produced by this highly infectious pathogen. A large percentage of cancer cases diagnosed are strongly related to dysregulations of the tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) family and its downstream signaling pathways. As such, many therapeutic agents have been developed to strategically target these structures in order to hinder certain mechanisms pertaining to the phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells such as division, invasion or metastatic potential. Interestingly, several authors have pointed out that a correlation between coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 or MERS viruses and dysregulations of signaling pathways activated by TKRs can be established. This information may help to accelerate the repurposing of clinically developed anti-TKR cancer drugs in COVID-19 management. Because the need for treatment is critical, drug repurposing may be an advantageous choice in the search for new and efficient therapeutic compounds. This approach would be advantageous from a financial point of view as well, given that the resources used for research and development would no longer be required and can be potentially redirected towards other key projects. This review aims to provide an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with different TKRs and their respective downstream signaling pathway and how several therapeutic agents targeted against these receptors can interfere with the viral infection. Additionally, this review aims to identify if SARS-CoV-2 can be repurposed to be a potential viral vector against different cancer types.","Purcaru, Oana-Stefana; Artene, Stefan-Alexandru; Barcan, Edmond; Silosi, Cristian Adrian; Stanciu, Ilona; Danoiu, Suzana; Tudorache, Stefania; Tataranu, Ligia Gabriela; Dricu, Anica",Int. j. mol. sci.

High glucose levels can provide insight into the underlying pathogenesis of a disease and can contribute to tissue injury. Some patients with COVID-19 have hyperglycemia during hospitalizations. METHODS: The Infectious Disease and Control office at University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, provided a list of patients with a COVID-19 infection hospitalized between March 1 and May 15, 2020. The medical records were reviewed to collect information on age, gender, history of diabetes, and glucose levels on admission and through the first 7 days of hospitalization. RESULTS: This study included 63 patients with a mean age of 62.1 ± 14.1 years. Thirty-five patients (55.6%) were males. The in-hospital mortality rate was 30.2%. The mean admission glucose level was 129.4 ± 57.1 mg/dL in patients who survived (N = 47) and 189.6 ± 112.2 mg/dL in patients who died during hospitalization (N = 16, P = .007). An admission glucose greater than 180 mg/dL predicted mortality in a model adjusted for a diabetes, age, and male gender. The mean differences between the maximum and minimum glucose levels calculated over the first 7 days of hospitalization were 112.93 ± 115.4 (N = 47) in patients who survived and were 240.5 ± 97.7 (N = 15) in patients who died during hospitalization (P = .0003). A difference between the maximum and minimum glucose level greater than 105 mg/dL was associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who died during hospitalization for COVID-19 had higher admission glucose levels than patients who survived. Larger differences between maximum and minimum glucose levels during the first 7 days of hospitalization were associated with increased mortality. These results suggest that high glucose levels identify patients at increased risk for mortality and warrant more study.","Rao, Sanjana; Ali, Kiran; Dennis, Jeff; Berdine, Gilbert; Test, Victor; Nugent, Kenneth",J Prim Care Community Health,473,20

Dramatic reductions in the adult elective surgery are ubiquitous, but corresponding changes in pediatric services are not well described. The Swedish Perioperative Registry contains data on all anesthetic procedures in Sweden, and therefore, provides a unique opportunity to analyze the effect of the pandemic on the pediatric anesthesia capacity on a national level. We hypothesized that there would be a significant reduction in pediatric elective procedures. The aim was to determine the effects on pediatric surgical and anesthetic services during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. METHODS: For this retrospective registry cohort study, we extracted all procedures performed on patients <18 years of age in 2020 and 2019. Weeks 12 to 26 of 2020 were defined as the first wave, and data were analyzed according to level of care, type of surgery, procedure code, and emergency or elective surgery. RESULTS: We found 7015 fewer procedures during the first wave epoch. Elective cases were reduced by 53.7% while emergency surgery was not significantly affected. During the peak of the first wave in April, there was a 72.8% reduction in elective cases; ENT/maxillofacial surgery showed the greatest reduction (86.7%). The surgical and anesthesia capacity recovered to near-normal levels by the end of June 2020. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric surgical procedures in Sweden during the first wave of the pandemic was dramatic, but elective services were restored a few months after the peak.","Melander, Sixten; Almström, Jimmy; Enlund, Gunnar; Frykholm, Peter",Paediatr Anaesth,473,5

Unfortunately, hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan is suboptimal according to previous studies. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate hand hygiene adherence among physicians and nurses before touching hospitalized patients and to evaluate changes in hand hygiene adherence after a multimodal intervention was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a pre- and postintervention study with HCWs at four tertiary hospitals in Niigata, Japan. Hand hygiene observations were conducted from June to August 2018 (preintervention) and February to March 2019 (postintervention). INTERVENTION: The multimodal hand hygiene intervention recommended by the World Health Organization was tailored to each hospital and implemented from September 2018 to February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We observed hand hygiene adherence before touching patients in each hospital and compared rates before and after intervention. Intervention components were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were 2,018 patient observations preintervention and 1,630 postintervention. Overall, hand hygiene adherence improved from 453 of 2,018 preintervention observations (22.4%) to 548 of 1,630 postintervention observations (33.6%; P < .001). Rates improved more among nurses (13.9 percentage points) than among doctors (5.7 percentage points). Improvement varied among the hospitals: Hospital B (18.4 percentage points) was highest, followed by Hospitals D (11.4 percentage points), C (11.3 percentage points), and Hospital A (6.5 percentage points). CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention improved hand hygiene adherence rates in physicians and nurses in Niigata, Japan; however, further improvement is necessary. Given the current suboptimal hand hygiene adherence rates in Japanese hospitals, the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital setting is a concern.","Saitoh, Akihiko; Sato, Kiyomi; Magara, Yoko; Osaki, Kakuei; Narita, Kiyoko; Shioiri, Kumiko; Fowler, Karen E; Ratz, David; Saint, Sanjay",J Hosp Med,473,16

Inhaled methoxyflurane represents a promising treatment option; however, data in the elderly population are limited. Patients and Methods: Subgroup, post hoc analysis including 69 patients aged &#8805;65 years from a randomized, active-controlled, open-label study in the emergency setting. Key inclusion criterion was moderate-to-severe pain (Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] score &#8805; 4]) secondary to trauma in a single limb. Patients received inhaled methoxyflurane (3 mL) or standard analgesic treatment (SAT; IV paracetamol 1 g or ketoprofen 100 mg for moderate pain [NRS 4-6] and IV morphine 0.1mg/kg for severe pain [NRS &#8805;7]). The primary endpoint was the overall change in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity from randomization to the next 3, 5, and 10 min. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of pain relief (TOPR), efficacy up to 30 min, judgment of operators and patients, and safety. Results: Pain reduction over time was similar in both groups. Median TOPR was shorter for methoxyflurane (9 min; 95% CI: 7.8, 10.2 min) than SAT (15 min; 95% CI: 10.2, 19.8 min). In terms of treatment satisfaction, patients and operators rated treatment efficacy and practicality, respectively, as ""Excellent"" or ""Very good"" 5.7 times and 3.4 times more frequently than SAT. A similar rate of adverse events (methoxyflurane: 6 events; SAT: 7 events) was recorded, all non-serious. No clinically significant changes in vital signs parameters were observed, and methoxyflurane did not result in cases of bradycardia or hypotension. Conclusion: In elderly patients with trauma pain, inhaled methoxyflurane shows similar pain relief and safety compared to SAT, offering advantages in terms of onset of effect and user's satisfaction. Although this analysis presents some methodological limitations, it provides the first specific evidence of the use of inhaled methoxyflurane in the elderly population.

Polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400) is an important constituent of eye drops and artificial tears. The present study was targeted to study the binding of &#945;-crystallin and PEG-400 employing multi spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) along with molecular modeling and docking approach. There was an apparent hypochromism in &#945;-crystallin in the presence of varying PEG-400 concentrations; the binding constant obtained was 0.9 X 105 M-1 implying that strong binding is taking place between &#945;-crystallin and PEG-400. Fluorescence spectroscopy suggested good binding of PEG-400 to &#945;-crystallin with a binding constant (K) of 106 M-1. Moreover, fluorescence quenching studies carried out at three different temperatures suggested &#945;-crystallin-PEG-400 complex formation to be guided by combination of static and dynamic modes. Thermodynamic parameters suggested &#945;-crystallin-PEG-400 complex formation is driven by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, making it seemingly specific. Far UV-CD spectra revealed no shift in the peak implying no alterations in the secondary structure of &#945;-crystallin upon PEG-400 binding further validating complex formation. In vitro assays were further entrenched by in silico assays. Molecular modeling was used to make the functionally active form of &#945;-crystallin. A binding pocket located in the ß chain was delineated by Prank Web; molecular docking showed binding of PEG-400 in this pocket.

The widespread use of these devices and the long-term nature of the recorded data provides a valuable source of physical activity data for epidemiological research. The challenges include the large heterogeneity between activity tracker models in terms of available data types, the accuracy of recorded data, and how this data can be shared between different providers and third-party systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a system to record data on physical activity from different providers of consumer-based activity trackers and to examine its usability as a tool for physical activity monitoring in epidemiological research. The longitudinal nature of the data and the concurrent pandemic outbreak allowed us to show how the system can be used for surveillance of physical activity levels before, during, and after a COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We developed a system (mSpider) for automatic recording of data on physical activity from participants wearing activity trackers from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Polar, Samsung, and Withings, as well as trackers storing data in Google Fit and Apple Health. To test the system throughout development, we recruited 35 volunteers to wear a provided activity tracker from early 2019 and onward. In addition, we recruited 113 participants with privately owned activity trackers worn before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Norway. We examined monthly changes in the number of steps, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and activity energy expenditure between 2019 and 2020 using bar plots and two-sided paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to March 2019, there was a significant reduction in mean step count and mean activity energy expenditure during the March 2020 lockdown period. The reduction in steps and activity energy expenditure was temporary, and the following monthly comparisons showed no significant change between 2019 and 2020. A small significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was observed for several monthly comparisons after the lockdown period and when comparing March-December 2019 with March-December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: mSpider is a working prototype currently able to record physical activity data from providers of consumer-based activity trackers.

To date, no medication supported by randomized clinical trials has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. At the time of writing of this paper, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible - according to modest estimations - for around 4 million of infections and 300 000 deaths. Unveiling details of patomechanism, in fatal cases the role of immune dysregulation, namely cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been discovered. Based on the current knowledge, interleukin-6 (IL6) plays a pivotal role in COVID-19 associated CRS. Case reports and result of small case series suggest efficacy of an IL6 inhibitor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) in treating CRS.

This study was to investigate the epidemic, clinical, and imaging features of pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia for early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Forty-one children infected with COVID-19 were analyzed in the epidemic, clinical and imaging data. RESULTS: Among 30 children with mild COVID-19, seven had no symptoms, fifteen had low or mediate fever, and eight presented with cough, nasal congestion, diarrhea, headache, or fatigue. Among eleven children with moderate COVID-19, nine presented with low or mediate fever, accompanied with cough and runny nose, and two had no symptoms. Significantly (P < 0.05) more children had a greater rate of cough in moderate than in mild COVID-19. Thirty children with mild COVID-19 were negative in pulmonary CT imaging, whereas eleven children with moderate COVID-19 had pulmonary lesions, including ground glass opacity in ten (90.9%), patches of high density in six (54.5%), consolidation in three (27.3%), and enlarged bronchovascular bundles in seven (63.6%). The lesions were distributed along the bronchus in five patients (45.5%). The lymph nodes were enlarged in the pulmonary hilum in two patients (18.2%). The lesions were presented in the right upper lobe in two patients (18.1%), right middle lobe in one (9.1%), right lower lobe in six (54.5%), left upper lobe in five (45.5%), and left lower lobe in eight (72.7%).

Australia has reported low TTS incidence of <3/100,000 after the first dose, with case fatality rate (CFR) of 5-6%. Risk-benefit analysis of vaccination has been challenging because of rapidly evolving data, changing levels of transmission, and age-specific variation in rates of TTS, COVID-19, and CFR. We aim to optimise risk-benefit analysis by developing a model that enables inputs to be updated rapidly as evidence evolves. A Bayesian network was used to integrate local and international data, government reports, published literature and expert opinion. The model estimates probabilities of outcomes under different scenarios of age, sex, low/medium/high transmission (0.05%/0.45%/5.76% of population infected over 6 months), SARS-CoV-2 variant, vaccine doses, and vaccine effectiveness. We used the model to compare estimated deaths from vaccine-associated TTS with i) COVID-19 deaths prevented under different scenarios, and ii) deaths from COVID-19 related atypical severe blood clots (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis & portal vein thrombosis). For a million people aged [≥]70 years where 70% received first dose and 35% received two doses, our model estimated <1 death from TTS, 25 deaths prevented under low transmission, and >3000 deaths prevented under high transmission. Risks versus benefits varied significantly between age groups and transmission levels. Under high transmission, deaths prevented by AZ vaccine far exceed deaths from TTS (by 8 to >4500 times depending on age). Probability of dying from COVID-related atypical severe blood clots was 58-126 times higher (depending on age and sex) than dying from TTS. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of Bayesian networks for risk-benefit analysis for a COVID-19 vaccine. The model can be rapidly updated to incorporate new data, adapted for other countries, extended to other outcomes (e.g., severe disease), or used for other vaccines.

A great deal of research has examined who falls for misinformation and why, and what can be done to make people more discerning consumers of news. Comparatively little work, however, has considered the choices of those who produce misinformation, and how these choices interact with the psychology of news consumers. Here we use game-theoretic models to study the strategic interaction between news publishers and news readers. We show that publishers who seek to spread misinformation can generate high engagement with falsehoods by using strategies that mix true and false stories over time, in such a way that they serve more false stories to more loyal readers. These coercive strategies cause false stories to receive higher reader engagement than true stories - even when readers strictly prefer truth over falsehood. In contrast, publishers who seek to promote engagement with accurate information will use strategies that generate more engagement with true stories than with false stories. We confirm these predictions empirically by examining 1,000 headlines from 20 mainstream and 20 fake news sites, comparing Facebook engagement data with 20,000 perceived accuracy ratings collected in a survey experiment. We show that engagement is positively correlated with accuracy among mainstream sites, but negatively correlated with accuracy among misinformation sites. We then use our model to analyze the conditions under which news sites seeking engagement will produce false stories. We show that if a publisher incorrectly assumes that readers prefer falsehoods, their resulting publication strategy can nonetheless manufacture greater engagement with false news - leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of false news promotion.","Stewart, Alexander J.; Arechar, Antonio A.; Rand, David G.; Plotkin, Joshua B.",,473,23

The traditional physical and face-to-face meetings are avoided in accordance to reducing the close physical contacts among individuals. Thus, a new paradigm shift towards teaching and learning needs to be highly enforced. Teaching and learning on medical field especially require for real world anatomy against human or living things body. In response to providing the facility for medical teachers and learners, Gross Anatomy Augmented Reality (GAAR) is introduced. GAAR is an android mobile Augmented Reality (AR) learning tool to assist the educators and learners in internalizing 3D human anatomy with more fun and interactivity. The AR methodology is implied to attract the personal impacts and feelings towards operating of close to ‘real’ organ during anatomy practices. Traditional learning methods are changed with AR technology through small digital device. This application may be able to show the students the actual form of human gross anatomy and assist the teachers or educators’ in explaining the sciences behind human body in more interactive and interesting. Furthermore, this application uses a 3-dimensional object, video and interactive info so that students are interested in using this application. The AR for education and learning is vital in bridging the digital divide among all generations through the conversion of static pictures into real-like 3D animation. The implementation results show that, through the real visualization, small to adult learners can imitate the real truth on human organ and how this can motivate them to take care of their bodies that would lead to a healthier living styles as well as easy memorizing of the subject contents. © 2021.

Despite widespread interest in the pathophysiology of the disease, relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the peripheral lung of patients who die from Covid-19. METHODS: We examined 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from Covid-19 and compared them with 7 lungs obtained during autopsy from patients who died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to influenza A(H1N1) infection and 10 age-matched, uninfected control lungs. The lungs were studied with the use of seven-color immunohistochemical analysis, micro-computed tomographic imaging, scanning electron microscopy, corrosion casting, and direct multiplexed measurement of gene expression. RESULTS: In patients who died from Covid-19-associated or influenza-associated respiratory failure, the histologic pattern in the peripheral lung was diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular T-cell infiltration. The lungs from patients with Covid-19 also showed distinctive vascular features, consisting of severe endothelial injury associated with the presence of intracellular virus and disrupted cell membranes. Histologic analysis of pulmonary vessels in patients with Covid-19 showed widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy. Alveolar capillary microthrombi were 9 times as prevalent in patients with Covid-19 as in patients with influenza (P<0.001). In lungs from patients with Covid-19, the amount of new vessel growth - predominantly through a mechanism of intussusceptive angiogenesis - was 2.7 times as high as that in the lungs from patients with influenza (P<0.001).

Very few studies involving paediatric age patients have been published until now. This study aims to determine the presence of olfactory dysfunction in children with COVID-19 infection through the use of a self-reported questionnaire and a new olfactory screening tool. METHODS: Nested case-control study. All paediatric patients screened by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for COVID-19 infection, during the study period (March-May 2020), were asked to respond to a questionnaire about symptoms of olfactory disfunction. Patients above six years old also performed an odor identification test based on seven odorants (Kradeo®). This test was designed based on our cultural context and eating habits. RESULTS: 126 patients were recruited, including 33 with COVID-19 infection. 15% of the infected children referred anosmia and/or dysgeusia on the questionnaire, all of them were older than eleven years. The results of the odor test (69 patients) revealed subtle disturbances in the infected group (mostly misrecognition of odorants). Median odorant recognition was 3 odors [Interquartile range (IQR) 2-4] in case group and 4 [IQR 3-5] in controls. Male patients showed significantly larger disturbances than girls in both groups (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Self-referred prevalence of olfactory disfunction in our sample of infected children is lower than that described in adults, especially among the youngest ones, maybe due to immature development of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed in nasal mucosa. Nevertheless, one month after infection, subtle disturbances (misrecognition of odors) were identified among the infected children. This screening olfactory test provides a hygienic, user-friendly tool, suitable for screening children older than six years of age.","Concheiro-Guisan, Ana; Fiel-Ozores, Antía; Novoa-Carballal, Reyes; González-Duran, María Luisa; Portugués de la Red, Mar; Martínez-Reglero, Cristina; Fernández-Pinilla, Isabel; González-Guijarro, Isabel",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,473,26

In particular, we analyze the areas in which social robots are being adopted, the roles and tasks being fulfilled, and the robot models being implemented. For that, we traced back and analyzed 195 experiences with 66 different social robots worldwide that have been adopted during the coronavirus outbreak. We identified a clear resurgence and expansion of social robots during the crisis. The social robots' capacity to perform the roles of liaison in tasks that require human-human interaction, to act as a safeguard to ensure contagion risk-free environments, and to act as well-being coaches by providing therapeutic and entertaining functions for quarantined patients, which are directly associated with the needs of facilitating physical distance and palliate the effects of isolation, have been key to the renaissance of these robots during the pandemic.","Aymerich-Franch, Laura; Ferrer, Iliana",,473,8

We investigated a decline in admissions for stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and emergency department (ED) stroke alert activations. METHODS: We retrospectively compiled total weekly hospital admissions for stroke and TIA between 31 December 2018 and 21 April 2019 versus 30 December 2019 and 19 April 2020 at five US tertiary academic comprehensive stroke centres in cities with early COVID-19 outbreaks in Boston, New York City, Providence and Seattle. We collected available data on ED stroke alerts, stroke severity using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and time from symptom onset to hospital arrival. RESULTS: Compared with 31 December 2018 to 21 April 2019, a decline in stroke/TIA admissions and ED stroke alerts occurred during 30 December 2019 to 19 April 2020 (p trend <0.001 for each). The declines coincided with state stay-at-home recommendations in late March. The greatest decline in hospital admissions was observed between 23 March and 19 April 2020, with a 31% decline compared with the corresponding weeks in 2019. Three of the five centres with 2019 and 2020 stroke alert data had a 46% decline in ED stroke alerts in late March and April 2020, compared with 2019. Median baseline NIHSS during these 4 weeks was 10 in 2020 and 7 in 2019. There was no difference in time from symptom onset to hospital arrival. CONCLUSION: At these five large academic US hospitals, admissions for stroke and TIA declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a trend for fewer ED stroke alerts at three of the five centres with available 2019 and 2020 data. Acute stroke therapies are time-sensitive, so decreased healthcare access or utilisation may lead to more disabling or fatal strokes, or more severe non-neurological complications related to stroke. Our findings underscore the indirect effects of this pandemic. Public health officials, hospital systems and healthcare providers must continue to encourage patients with stroke to seek acute care during this crisis.","Sharma, Malveeka; Lioutas, Vasileios-Arsenios; Madsen, Tracy; Clark, Judith; O039,; Sullivan, Jillian; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Willey, Joshua Z; Marshall, Randolph S; Selim, Magdy H; Greer, David; Tirschwell, David L; Burton, Tina; Boehme, Amelia; Aparicio, Hugo J",,473,1

These include: (i) inadequate healthcare spending causing, for instance, a shortage of protective equipment, testing swabs, masks, surgical gloves, gowns, etc.; (ii) a high population density that causes close physical contact among community members who reside in compact places, hence they are more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, including coronavirus; and (iii) mass panic due to the fear of experiencing the loss of loved ones, lockdown, and shortage of food. In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression. The high incidence of poverty and social closeness increases more vulnerable conditions that spread coronavirus across countries. The momentous increase in healthcare expenditures put a burden on countries' national healthcare bills that stretch the depression phase-out of the boundary. The forecasting relationship suggested the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy would last the next 10 years. Unified global healthcare policies, physical distancing, smart lockdowns, and meeting food challenges are largely required to combat the coronavirus pandemic and escape from global depression.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Yousaf, Zahid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Sheikh, Abdullah Zafar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Zaman, Khalid",Front.

To explore the feasibility of establishing a combined rotavirus-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we generated recombinant (r)SA11 rotaviruses with modified segment 7 RNAs that contained coding cassettes for NSP3, a translational 2A stop-restart signal, and a FLAG-tagged portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein: S1 fragment, N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), extended RBD (ExRBD), or S2 core (CR) domain. Generation of rSA11 containing the S1 coding sequence required a sequence insertion of 2.2 kbp, the largest such insertion yet introduced into the rotavirus genome. Immunoblotting showed that rSA11 viruses containing the smaller NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR coding sequences expressed S-protein products of expected size, with ExRBD expressed at highest levels. These rSA11 viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. In contrast, the rSA11 virus containing the full-length S coding sequence (rSA11/NSP3-fS1) failed to express its expected 80 kDa fS1 product, for unexplained reasons. Moreover, rSA11/NSP3-fS1 was genetically unstable, with variants lacking the S1 insertion appearing during serial passage. Nonetheless, these results emphasize the potential usefulness of rotavirus vaccines as expression vectors of immunogenic portions of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including NTD, RBD, ExRBD, and CR, that have sizes smaller than the S1 fragment.","Philip, Asha Ann Patton John Thomas",Vaccines,473,24

Thus, there is an immediate need for novel therapeutics that can combat this deadly infection. In this study, we report the therapeutic assessment of azurin and its peptides: p18 and p28 against the viral structural S-protein and non-structural 3CLpro and PLpro proteins. Among the analyzed complexes, azurin docked relatively well with the S2 domain of S-protein compared to the other viral proteins. The derived peptide p18 bound to the active site domain of the PLpro protein; however, in other complexes, lesser interactions were recorded. The second azurin derived peptide p28, fared the best among the docked proteins. p28 interacted with all the three viral proteins and the host ACE-2 receptor by forming several electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with the S-protein, 3CLpro, and PLpro. MD simulations indicated that p28 exhibited a strong affinity to S-protein and ACE-2 receptor, indicating a possibility of p28 as a protein-protein interaction inhibitor. Our data suggest that the p28 has potential as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and can be further exploited to establish its validity in the treatment of current and future SARS-CoV crisis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to prevent this occupational disease. Surgical masks and filtering face piece (FFP) respirators are important parts of this PPE. European standard EN 149 establishes three protection levels for FFP respirators (FFP1, FFP2, FFP3), depending on the particle infiltration degree through their materials, and these, in turn, are based on their filtration effectiveness. The aim of this laboratory test is to determine and quantify the filtration and fit rate of different FFP respirators, singly and in combination with surgical masks, by performing a series of fit tests and consequently, to check whether this combination improves protection levels for healthcare workers who care for COVID-19 patients. Material and Methods: Several FFP respirators and surgical masks, singly and in combination, were fit tested with a PortaCount Pro + 8038, which fulfills OSHA standards, in a series of tests performed on healthcare workers in seven different breathing situations when taking care on COVID-19 patients, in order to determine and quantify their fit to the workers' face. Results: Wearing a surgical mask together with a highly efficient FFP respirator provided increased respiratory protection. Interestingly, one of these highly efficient FFP models, combined with a surgical mask, achieved a protection factor over 200 (whereas 100 is the minimum required protection factor). Conclusions: Surgical masks, when used together with a FFP2 respirator, could significantly improve the degree of fit of all self-filtering face piece by providing greater filtration efficiency and greater user protection from exposure to aerosols.

La norma europea EN 149 establece y clasifica las mascarillas autofiltrantes en tres niveles de protección dependiendo del porcentaje de fuga del total de partículas en suspensión del aire exterior hacia el aire interior FFP1, FFP2, FFP3. El objetivo de este e ensayo de laboratorio es determinar y cuantificar el nivel de ajuste de las mascarillas autofiltrantes FFP2 combinadas con las mascarillas quirúrgicas mediante series de pruebas de ajuste (fit test). Material y Métodos: Se utilizó el equipo medidor de ajuste de mascarillas FFP modelo PortaCount® Pro + 8038 compatible con las normas y metodología de la OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) de los EEUU. Se realizaron series de pruebas de ajuste sobre diferentes modelos de mascarillas autofiltrantes FFP2 con y sin mascarilla quirúrgica para diferentes situaciones de respiración del trabajador participante en este experimento. Resultados: El uso de la mascarilla quirúrgica sobre una mascarilla autofiltrante FFP2 aporta una mejora en la protección respiratoria determinante, incrementando el factor de ajuste hasta de +200 (el factor de ajuste mínimo debe ser 100). Conclusiones: Las mascarillas quirúrgicas cuando se usan conjuntamente con las mascarillas autofiltrantes, podrían mejorar significativamente el grado de ajuste de todas las mascarillas autofiltrantes proporcionando una mayor eficacia de filtración y una mayor protección al usuario frente a la exposición a aerosoles.

The immune mechanisms that potentially orchestrate the pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection are complex and only partially understood. There is still paucity of data on the features of myeloid cells involved in this viral infection. For this reason, we investigated the different activation status profiles and the subset distribution of myeloid cells and their correlation with disease progression in 40 COVID-19 patients at different stages of disease. COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in the absolute number of plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, different subset distribution of monocytes and different activation patterns of both monocytes and neutrophils, coupled to a significant reduction of HLA-DR monocyte levels. We found that some of these alterations are typical of all COVID-19 patients, while some others vary at different stages of the disease and correlate with biochemical parameters of inflammation. Collectively, these data suggest that not only the lymphoid, but also the myeloid compartment, is severely affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Peruzzi, Benedetta; Bencini, Sara; Capone, Manuela; Mazzoni, Alessio; Maggi, Laura; Salvati, Lorenzo; Vanni, Anna; Orazzini, Chiara; Nozzoli, Carlo; Morettini, Alessandro; Poggesi, Loredana; Pieralli, Filippo; Peris, Adriano; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria; Liotta, Francesco; Caporale, Roberto; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Annunziato, Francesco",Immunology,473,16

We describe here the case of a previously healthy 8-year-old girl who presented with seizures, encephalopathy, and rapidly progressive, diffuse, and ultimately fatal cerebral edema in the setting of acute COVID-19 infection. CSF analysis, microbiological testing, and neuropathology yielded no evidence of infection or acute inflammation within the central nervous system. Acute fulminant cerebral edema (AFCE) is an often fatal pediatric clinical entity consisting of fever, encephalopathy, and new-onset seizures followed by rapid, diffuse, and medically-refractory cerebral edema. AFCE occurs as a rare complication of a variety of common pediatric infections and a CNS pathogen is identified in only a minority of cases, suggesting a para-infectious mechanism of edema. This report suggests that COVID-19 infection can precipitate AFCE, and highlights the need for high suspicion and early recognition thereof.","Ninan, S.; Thompson, P.; Gershon, T.; Ford, N.; Mills, W.; Jewells, V.; Thorne, L.; Saunders, K.; Bouldin, T.; Smedberg, J.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore factors associated with health services utilization among breast cancer patients during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. METHOD: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of perceived health status, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, anxiety, coping resources, health services utilization (contact with healthcare professionals and cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic), and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated; contact with healthcare professionals was the dependent variable. In addition, a logistic regression was calculated; cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic because of the COVID-19 was the dependent variable. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients' contact with healthcare professionals was lower than their contact prior to the pandemic. A higher extent of contact with healthcare professionals was related to patients' perception of health as bad/reasonable, lower perceived susceptibility, a lower sense of mastery, and higher social support. In addition, the odds of cancelling an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic were higher in the presence of additional chronic illnesses and a higher sense of mastery. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results could provide public health agencies with a more complete picture of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among breast cancer patients. This is significant because, in the event that COVID-19 re-emerges, the findings of the current study could help guide public health officials and possibly prevent the future avoidance of health services' use among this high-risk population.","Shinan-Altman, Shiri; Levkovich, Inbar; Tavori, Guy",Palliat Support Care,473,15

However, the relationship between COVID-19 and heart failure (HF) is unclear, specifically whether HF is an independent risk factor for severe infection or if other accompanying comorbidities are responsible for the increased risk. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 1331 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between March and June 2020 admitted at Rush University System for Health (RUSH) in metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, USA. Patients with history of HF were identified by International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code assignments extracted from the electronic medical record. Propensity score matching was utilized to control for the numerous confounders, and univariable logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between HF and 60-day morbidity and mortality outcomes. Results: The propensity score matched cohort consisted of 188 patients in both the HF and no HF groups. HF patients did not have lower 60-day mortality (OR 0.81; pâ¯=â¯0.43) compared to patients without HF. However, those with HF were more likely to require readmission within 60â¯days (OR 2.88; pâ¯<â¯0.001) and sustain myocardial injury defined as troponin elevation within 60â¯days (OR 3.14; pâ¯<â¯0.05). Conclusions: This study highlights the complex network of confounders present between HF and COVID-19. When balanced for these numerous factors, those with HF appear to be at no higher risk of 60-day mortality from COVID-19 but are at increased risk for morbidity.","Ruge, Max; Gomez, Joanne Michelle D; du Fay de Lavallaz, Jeanne; Hlepas, Alexander; Rahman, Annas; Patel, Priya; Hoster, Clay; Lavani, Prutha; Nair, Gatha G; Jahan, Nusrat; Alan Simmons, J; Rao, Anupama K; Cotts, William; Williams, Kim; Volgman, Annabelle Santos; Marinescu, Karolina; Suboc, Tisha",Am Heart J Plus,473,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional research was performed online between 30 August 2020 and 15 September 2020. The population of the study consisted of adults aged between 18 and 80 years, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection forms (introductory information and risk perception form and cleaning products usage characteristics form) were shared through Web2 tools. The questionnaire study was completed with 674 participants between the ages of 18 and 80 years in Turkey. Descriptive statistics and classification tree were used in the analysis of the data. Statistical significance was accepted as P &#8804; .01 in all analyses. RESULTS: During the pandemic period compared with the pre-pandemic period, it was observed that the frequency of cleaning (69.3%) and the amount of cleaning product usage (74.2%) increased significantly and the frequency of problems related to the use of cleaning products was found as 46.9%. The most commonly reported problems were skin disturbances (68%) and shortness of breath (23%). It was determined that the history of contact with the COVID-19 patient, the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and risky cleaning behaviour were predictive in determining the risk of experiencing problems related to cleaning products. The amount of bleach consumed per month among who did experience problems was higher than those who did not experience problems and was associated with the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: In the COVID-19 pandemic, human beings have been found to increase the frequency of cleaning and using cleaning products. In order to reduce the negative effects of chemicals used for cleaning on human and environmental health, the trainings to be given by the teams providing primary healthcare services can be effective as well as general education activities for community groups.","Koksoy Vayisoglu, Sumbule; Oncu, Emine",Int J Clin Pract,473,6

In the field of functional urology, there are clinical situations with a high risk of complication if management is delayed and a great heterogeneity of advisable reprogramming times after cancellation. A prioritization of functional urology procedures is necessary to adapt management during the COVID-19 crisis and to better organize post-epidemic recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The advice of AFU scientific committees in the field of functional urology (neuro-urology, female and perineology, male LUTS) was requested and supplemented by a review of the currently available recommendations on the subject of urology and COVID-19. These opinions were combined to draw up temporary recommendations to help reorganize practices during the epidemic and prepare the post-critical phase. RESULTS: Most of the recommendations available on career-oriented social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn) or in literature concern cancer or general urology. Eight out of ten propose a cancellation of all functional urology procedures without distinction. But the 3 AFU committees covering the field of functional urology have identified three clinical situations in which surgical procedures that can be maintained during the COVID-19 epidemic (priority level A): conclusion of a neuromodulation test in progress (implantation or explantation), botulinum toxin A bladder injections for unbalanced neurologic bladder, cystectomy and ileal conduit for urinary fistula in perineal bedsore or refractory unbalanced neurologic bladder with acute renal failure and vesico-enteric or prostato-pubic fistulas. Management adaptation of the other pathologies are proposed, as well as the application of 3 priority levels (B, C, D) for rescheduled procedures for a better management of the post-crisis activity resumption. CONCLUSION: The joint functional urology committees indicate that there are specific clinical situations in this field that demand non-delayed care during COVID crisis. They underline the need to establish a hierarchy for the cancelled surgeries, in order to reduce the arm of long reschedule delays and to optimize post-lockdown activity resumption.","Michel, F; Gaillet, S; Cornu, J N; Robert, G; Game, X; Phé, V; Karsenty, G",Prog Urol,473,1

This paper traces the crosscountry associations between COVID-19 mortality, policy interventions aimed at limiting social contact, and their interactions with institutional and demographic characteristics. We document that, with a lag, more stringent pandemic policies were associated with lower mortality growth rates. The association between stricter pandemic policies and lower future mortality growth is more pronounced in countries with a greater proportion of the elderly population and urban population, greater democratic freedoms, and larger international travel flows. Countries with greater policy stringency in place prior to the first death realized lower peak mortality rates and exhibited lower durations to the first mortality peak. In contrast, countries with higher initial mobility saw higher peak mortality rates in the first phase of the pandemic, and countries with a larger elderly population, a greater share of employees in vulnerable occupations, and a higher level of democracy took longer to reach their peak mortalities. Our results suggest that policy interventions are effective at slowing the geometric pattern of mortality growth, reducing the peak mortality, and shortening the duration to the first peak. We also shed light on the importance of institutional and demographic characteristics in guiding policy-making for future waves of the pandemic.","Jinjarak, Y.; Ahmed, R.; Nair-Desai, S.; Xin, WeiNing Aizenman J.",Working Paper Series - National Bureau of Economic Research (Massachusetts)|2020.

Evidence from Kenya shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems have been either stressed to their maximum capacity or are becoming overwhelmed. However, the population is advised not to attend hospital unless strictly necessary, and this advice seems to apply to all, including expectant mothers. There is a dearth of information on how poor expectant mothers with low bargaining power cope during COVID-19 in Kenya, which this study addresses for those in Kilifi County. This rapid qualitative study draws data from an extensive literature review and from interviews with 12 purposively selected mothers who were either expectant or had newborn babies during the pandemic in Kilifi County. Five matrons-in-charge of maternal health services and four traditional birth attendants were also interviewed via mobile phone. Data were analyzed thematically and are presented in a textual description. It emerged that expectant mothers feared attending hospitals for perinatal care due to the possibility of contracting COVID-19. Therefore, there was an increase in home deliveries with the assistance of traditional birth attendants (TBAs)/traditional midwives, who were also overwhelmed with women who sought their services. Since most causes of maternal morbidity and mortality can be prevented by prompt, suitable treatment by qualified health practitioners, the health officials interviewed recommended training and integration of TBAs in emergency healthcare responses to help during crises in MHS because they are trusted by their local communities. Notably, such integration of traditional midwives should be supported and should also include additional training and monetary incentives.","Ombere, S. O.",Front Sociol,473,10

While the number of symptomatically infected and severely ill people is high and has overwhelmed the medical systems of many countries, there is mounting evidence that some of the rapid spread of this virus has been driven by asymptomatic infections. In this study, we use a compartmental mathematical model of a viral epidemic that includes asymptomatic infection to examine the role of asymptomatic individuals in the spread of the infection. We apply the model to epidemics in California, Florida, New York, and Texas, finding that asymptomatic infections far outnumber reported symptomatic infections at the peak of the epidemic in all four states.

Eukaryotic cells are equipped with highly conserved stress-response mechanisms that support cellular function when homeostasis is compromised, promoting survival. Two such mechanisms - the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy - are involved in the cellular response to perturbations in the endoplasmic reticulum, in calcium homeostasis, in cellular energy or redox status. Each of them operates through conserved signaling pathways to promote cellular adaptations that include re-programming transcription of genes and translation of new proteins and degradation of cellular components. In addition to their specific functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that these pathways intersect in many ways in different contexts of cellular stress. Viral infections are a major cause of cellular stress as many cellular functions are coopted to support viral replication. Both UPR and autophagy are induced upon infection with many different viruses with varying outcomes - in some instances controlling infection while in others supporting viral replication and infection. The role of UPR and autophagy in response to coronavirus infection has been a matter of debate in the last decade. It has been suggested that CoV exploit components of autophagy machinery and UPR to generate double-membrane vesicles where it establishes its replicative niche and to control the balance between cell death and survival during infection. Even though the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated, it is clear that UPR and autophagy are intimately associated during CoV infections. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought renewed interest to this topic as several drugs known to modulate autophagy - including chloroquine, niclosamide, valinomycin, and spermine - were proposed as therapeutic options. Their efficacy is still debatable, highlighting the need to better understand the molecular interactions between CoV, UPR and autophagy.","Prestes, Elisa B; Bruno, Julia C P; Travassos, Leonardo H; Carneiro, Leticia A M",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,473,6

The pregnant population is also another concern for health care professionals. There are physiological changes related to pregnancy that result in different laboratory levels, radiological findings and disease progression. The goal of the present article is to determine whether the laboratory results and radiological findings were different in non-pregnant women (NPWs) of reproductive age and pregnant women (PWs) diagnosed with the Covid-19 infection. METHODS: Out of 34 patients, 15 (44.11%) PWs and 19 (55.8%) NPWs were included in the study. Age, comorbidities, complaints, vitals, respiratory rates, computed tomography (CT) findings and stages, as well as laboratory parameters, were recorded from the hospital database. RESULTS: The mean age of the PWs was of 27.6 ± 0.99 years, and that of the NPWs was of 37.63 ± 2.00; when age was compared between the groups, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) was found. The mean systolic blood pressure of the PWs was of 116.53 ± 11.35, and that of the NPWs was of 125.53 ± 13.00, and their difference was statistically significant (p = 0.05). The difference in the minimum respiratory rates of the patients was also statistically significant (p = 0.05). The platelet levels observed among the PWs with Covid-19 were lower than those of the NPWs (185.40 ± 39.09 × 109/mcL and 232.00 ± 71.04 × 109/mcL respectively; p = 0.05). The mean D-dimer value of the PWs was lower in comparison to that of the NPWs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The laboratory findings and imaging studies may differ between pregnant and non-pregnant populations. It is important to properly interpret these studies. Future studies with a higher number of patients are required to confirm these preliminary data.","Ozer, Kadir Burak; Sakin, Onder; Koyuncu, Kazibe; Cimenoglu, Berk; Demirhan, Recep",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,473,1

We assessed positivity rates and associated factors using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. A total of 228 paired serum samples (456 samples) were obtained from 228 participants. After baseline sampling, the second sampling was conducted between 11 and 28 days after the first dose of the AZ vaccine. Sera were tested using five SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays, including two surrogate virus neutralization tests. A questionnaire on the symptoms, severity, and duration of adverse reactions was completed by all participants. The overall positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 antibody were 84.6% for the Roche assay, 92.5% for the Abbott assay, 75.4% for the Siemens assay, 90.7% for the SD Biosensor assay, and 66.2% for the GenScript assay after the first dose of the AZ vaccine. The positivity rates and antibody titers of sera obtained between 21 and 28 days were significantly higher than those obtained between 11 and 20 days in all five assays. More-severe adverse reactions and longer durations of adverse reactions were related to higher SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. The agreements and correlations among the assays applied were substantial (Ðº, 0.73 to 0.95) and strong (&#961;, 0.83 to 0.91). A single dose of the AZ vaccine led to high positivity rates based on the five assays. Days after vaccination and adverse reactions could help estimate serologic conversion rates.

The identification of risk factors is important to allow more efficient public health and health services strategic interventions with a significant impact on deaths by COVID-19. This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 deaths in Portugal. Methods: A national dataset with the first 20,293 patients infected with COVID-19 between 1 January and 21 April 2020 was analyzed. The primary outcome measure was mortality by COVID-19, measured (registered and confirmed) by Medical Doctors serving as health delegates on the daily death registry. A logistic regression model using a generalized linear model was used for estimating Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each potential risk indicator.

(Special Issue: COVID-19.),18.27257,4.588308,2020,"Endocannaboid signaling plays a regulatory role in various (neuro)biological functions. 2-Arachidonoyglycerol (2-AG) is the most abundant endocannabinoid, and while its canonical biosynthetic pathway involving phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase &#945; is known, alternative pathways remain unsettled. Here, we characterize a non-canonical pathway implicating glycerophosphodiesterase 3 (GDE3, from GDPD2 gene). Human GDE3 expressed in HEK293T cell membranes catalyzed the conversion of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) into monoacylglycerol and inositol-1-phosphate. The enzyme was equally active against 1-acyl- and 2-acyl-LPI. When using 2-acyl LPI, where arachidonic acid is the predominant fatty acid, LC-MS analysis identified 2-AG as the main product of LPI hydrolysis by GDE3. Furthermore, inositol-1-phosphate release into the medium occurred upon addition of LPI to intact cells, suggesting that GDE3 is actually an ecto-lysophospholipase C. In cells expressing G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55, GDE3 abolished 1-acyl-LPI-induced signaling. In contrast, upon simultaneous expression of GDE3 and cannabinoid receptor CB2, 2-acyl-LPI evoked the same signal as that induced by 2-AG. These data strongly suggest that, beside simply degrading the GPR55 LPI ligand, GDE3 can act as a switch between GPR55 and CB2 signaling. Coincident with a major expression of both GDE3 and CB2 in spleen, spleens from transgenic mice lacking GDE3 displayed doubling of LPI content, compared to wild type mice. Decreased production of 2-AG in whole spleen was also observed, supporting the in vivo relevance of our findings. These data thus open a new research avenue in the field of endocannabinoid generation and reinforce the view of GPR55/LPI being genuine actors of endocannabinoid system.","Briand-Mésange, Fabienne; Pons, Véronique; Allart, Sophie; Masquelier, Julien; Chicanne, Gaetan; Beton, Nicolas; Payrastre, Bernard; Muccioli, Giulio G; Ausseil, Jérôme; Davignon, Jean-Luc; Salles, Jean-Pierre; Chap, Hugues",J. biol. chem,473,20

METHODS: This study was conducted at 28 centres from February 2020 to April 2020. Participants filled out a 62-item online survey including sociodemographic, COVID-19-related, epilepsy-related and psychological variables and were divided into two groups based on whether their seizure frequency increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to test differences in significant characteristics. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for seizure worsening. RESULTS: A total of 1,237 adult PWE were enrolled for analysis. Of this sample, 31 (8.33%) patients experienced an increase in seizures during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that feeling nervous about the pandemic (P < 0.05), poor quality of life (P = 0.001), drug reduction/withdrawal (P = 0.032), moderate anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak (P = 0.046) and non-seizure free before the COVID-19 outbreak (P < 0.05) were independently related to seizure increase during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, PWE with poor quality of life and mental status, as well as AED reduction/withdrawal, were more likely to experience seizure increase. This observation highlights the importance of early identification of the population at high risk of seizure worsening and implementation of preventive strategies during the pandemic.","Zeng, Chang; Meng, Hongmei; Zhu, Yulan; Yao, Lifen; Lian, Yajun; Zhu, Yanmei; Zhang, Min; Dai, Yuwei; Wang, Kang; Han, Xiong; Li, Ling; Zhang, Lifang; Xu, Huiqing; Yao, Dongai; Luo, Xinmin; Jiang, Wen; Wang, Xiahong; Zhao, Chuansheng; Chen, Yangmei; Deng, Xuejun; Liu, Chaorong; Feng, Li; Song, Yanmin; Wu, Yuan; Liao, Weiping; Wang, Furong; Zhu, Suiqiang; Xiao, Bo; Wang, Qun; Long, Lili",Seizure,473,2

Liposomes have seen an increased attention due to their physicochemical properties that allow them to act as nanocarriers of drugs and also of radioisotopes that can be used to diagnose and treat cancer. In order to obtain a novel permeability cancer imaging agent based on 99mTc-labeled liposomes, we describe microwave-assisted synthesis of stearyl 6-(benzylidenehydrazinyl) nicotinamide lipid, which was included in two formulations: nanometric hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC) liposome and its PEGylated coated analogue, HYNIC-PEG liposome. Radiolabeling with 99mTc via stearyl 6-(benzylidenehydrazinyl) nicotinamide was found to be easy, reproducible, and stable, revealing high radiochemical purity (94 ± 1.7%) for both liposomal formulations. Biodistribution at 4 h and 24 h and scintigraphic images at 4 h were performed in normal and melanoma-bearing C57BL/6 mice. Biodistribution studies at 4 h showed tumor uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC liposome and 99mTc-HYNIC-PEG liposome (1.1 ± 0.6 and 2.5 ± 0.4, respectively) and also at 24 h p.i.

However, the latency of MMA is still a major issue in ASR and should be combined with a technique that can reduce the test latency at inference time, such as head-synchronous beam search decoding, which forces all non-activated heads to activate after a small fixed delay from the first head activation. In this paper, we remove the discrepancy between training and test phases by considering, in the training of MMA, the interactions across multiple heads that will occur in the test time. Specifically, we derive the expected alignments from monotonic attention by considering the boundaries of other heads and reflect them in the learning process. We validate our proposed method on the two standard benchmark datasets for ASR and show that our approach, MMA with the mutually-constrained heads from the training stage, provides better performance than baselines.","Song, Jaeyun; Shim, Hajin; Yang, Eunho",,473,17

One of the most challenging and clinically relevant concepts in embryology is the heart outflow tract septation involving 180-degree spatial rotation and precise alignment of the growing septa that can often go awry, resulting in various congenital cardiac septal defects. Unfortunately, there are no visual aids that effectively demonstrate this complex process in 3D. To that end, a 3D embryonic virtual heart development model (EVH) with interchangeable conotruncal septa (Figure 1) was created and its educational efficacy was tested in a COMIRB exempt (# 20-2124), randomized single blind study with the first-year medical students completing a flipped-classroom embryology active learning event occurring in a virtual platform due to COVID-19 restrictions. As a part of the course requirement, all students first watched a pre-recorded lecture video and completed a quiz on their own before attending the synchronous virtual active learning event. During the active learning event, students were randomized into control or experimental breakout session groups. Experimental breakout session groups (16 groups, n=80) were provided access to the EVH with accompanying prompts designed to reinforce 3D spatial orientation and congenital septal defects demonstrated by the EVH (Figure 2). The control groups (14 groups, n=70) were tasked to complete a similar learning activity but on a different developmental process. All students completed a second quiz and a survey after the active learning event. A Kruskal-Wallis test comparing normalized pre-quiz versus post-quiz results revealed a significant increase on the post-quiz performance in the experimental group (p = 0.0198, df = 3) but not in the control group (p&gt;0.05). Descriptive statistics on quantitative survey data revealed that students positively perceived the educational value of the EVH, especially for demonstrating 3D changes of the normally and abnormally developing outflow tract. Consistently, thematic analysis of the survey comments indicated that the spatial and visual aspects of the EVH demonstrating the congenital defects were perceived as essential. The significantly high learning outcomes immediately after the resource interaction with EVH and the favorability of the EVH warrant a further development and research. Group and virtual classroom effects are other confounds that should be reduced in future studies.","Hight, Marissa Salcedo Ernesto Stratford Jennifer Bunker Hailey Jacobson Nicholas Hull Andrew Lee Lisa",The FASEB Journal,473,20

Initially, CT imaging was demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive tests for the detection of infection. Currently, with broader availability of polymerase chain reaction for disease diagnosis, CT is mainly used for the identification of complications and other defined clinical indications in hospitalized patients. Nonetheless, radiologists are interpreting lung imaging in unsuspected patients as well as in suspected patients with imaging obtained to rule out other relevant clinical indications. The knowledge of pathological findings is also crucial for imagers to better interpret various imaging findings. Identification of the imaging findings that are commonly seen with the disease is important to diagnose and suggest confirmatory testing in unsuspected cases. Proper precautionary measures will be important in such unsuspected patients to prevent further spread. In addition to understanding the imaging findings for the diagnosis of the disease, it is important to understand the growing set of tools provided by artificial intelligence. The goal of this review is to highlight common imaging findings using illustrative examples, describe the evolution of disease over time, discuss differences in imaging appearance of adult and pediatric patients and review the available literature on quantitative CT for COVID-19. We briefly address the known pathological findings of the COVID-19 lung disease that may help better understand the imaging appearance, and we provide a demonstration of novel display methodologies and artificial intelligence applications serving to support clinical observations.","Nagpal, Prashant; Narayanasamy, Sabarish; Vidholia, Aditi; Guo, Junfeng; Shin, Kyung Min; Lee, Chang Hyun; Hoffman, Eric A",Br J Radiol,473,22

METHODS: Various evolution analysis methods were employed. RESULTS: The estimated ratio of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (Ka/Ks) of SARS-CoV-2 was 1.008 or 1.094 based on 622 or 3624 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and nine key specific sites of high linkage, and four major haplotypes were found: H1, H2, H3 and H4. The results of Ka/Ks, detected population size and development trends of each major haplotype showed that H3 and H4 subgroups were going through a purify evolution and almost disappeared after detection, indicating that they might have existed for a long time. The H1 and H2 subgroups were going through a near neutral or neutral evolution and globally increased with time, and the frequency of H1 was generally high in Europe and correlated with the death rate (r >0.37), suggesting that these two haplotypes might relate to the infectivity or pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Several key specific sites and haplotypes related to the infectivity or pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, and the possible earlier origin time and place of SARS-CoV-2 were indicated based on the evolution and epidemiology of 16,373 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","Bai, Yunmeng; Jiang, Dawei; Lon, Jerome R; Chen, Xiaoshi; Hu, Meiling; Lin, Shudai; Chen, Zixi; Wang, Xiaoning; Meng, Yuhuan; Du, Hongli",Int J Infect Dis,473,24

Primary care or enabling services are provided by the NC Farmworker Health Program or community health centers that receive dedicated federal funding for MSFWs. The arrival of NC's growing season, MSFWs, and COVID-19 brought unforeseen challenges even to those experienced in caring for MSFWs. Challenges include congregate activities, consistency/accuracy of COVID-19 related communications, availability of alternate housing, barriers to testing and contact tracing, lack of internet connectivity in farmworker housing and insufficient personal protective equipment. Challenges are discussed in no order of occurrence or level of importance as many are inter-related. To meet these challenges, a migrant health and housing workgroup was convened. Members include the NC Department of Labor-Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau, NC Department of Health and Human Services - Communicable Disease Branch and NC Farmworker Health Program, NC Community Health Center Association and NC Agromedicine Institute. Members work collaboratively along the continuum from local to state levels and across agencies and communities to facilitate strategies to address COVID-19 challenges.

OBJECTIVE: to explore the epidemiology of older patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. DESIGN: a retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: a population-based study. SUBJECTS: the resident older patients (>65 years) diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: city-wide case series reported to Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 12 December 2019 to 17 March 2020 were included. The epidemic curves were constructed by dates of disease onset. RESULTS: 14,238 confirmed COVID-19 cases were older persons. The number of male cases were slightly less than female cases (1:1.01). The attack rate of COVID-19 in the older persons was 11.49 in Wuhan. There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic and then a gradual and steady decrease was performed. 3,723 (26.15%) and 734 (5.16%) patients were diagnosed as severe and critical cases, respectively.

Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS-CoV-2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. METHODS: All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir, or darunavir). Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban. For each patient, C-trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization. RESULTS: Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC. DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12. On average, C-trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre-hospitalization period. CONCLUSION: DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels. In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS-CoV-2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.","Testa, Sophie; Prandoni, Paolo; Paoletti, Oriana; Morandini, Rossella; Tala, Maurizio; Dellanoce, Claudia; Giorgi-Pierfranceschi, Matteo; Betti, Monia; Battista Danzi, Gian; Pan, Angelo; Palareti, Gualtiero",J Thromb Haemost,473,16

We evaluated features of trabeculation and explored cardiovascular (CV) outcome events (coronary revascularization, hospitalization for worsening heart failure (HF), stroke, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and CV death). Over a mean of 4.2 years, CV outcome events occurred in 122 (41%) patients who were older and exhibited an increased frequency of diabetes mellitus, stroke, implantation of ICD, HF and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of teleconsultations provided in the department of Strabismus, Paediatric and Neuro-ophthalmology was done. Patients with optic nerve related disorders were excluded. Study period was one month. Statistical analysis of collected data was done using Microsoft excel. Results: A total of 198 patients were provided teleconsultations (an average of seven teleconsultations/day). The final analysis included 161 patients after excluding optic nerve related disorders. The median age was seven years. We had a near equal gender distribution (53% males and 47% females) of whom a third were new cases. Video calling was used in 14%, review of clinical photos shared was used in 53%. Rest of the 33% were given telephonic advice.

Conclusion: Our experience of teleconsultation during COVID-19 times for paediatric ophthalmology and strabismus patients was very encouraging. Pivoting teleconsultation platform can provide primary eye care to most of the patients and work as essential forward triage for rest.

However, reading fluency continues to develop during secondary school, when the texts used most are expository texts. METHOD: The aim of our study was to investigate reading fluency and reading comprehension in secondary-school students, comparing two texts (i.e. narrative and expository) containing various types of sentences (i.e. declarative, adversative and enumerative sentences). RESULTS: We found differences in reading fluency between narrative and expository texts, the expository text being read with a more marked prosody (pauses and melodic contour) suggesting that readers rely on this for their understanding. In addition, we also found a relationship between reading fluency and reading comprehension, with a greater relationship of prosodic variables with the expository text than with the narrative one. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that reading fluency continues to develop during secondary school.

It has spread in nearly every continent. Researchers all over the world are trying to produce an effective vaccine against this virus, however;no specific treatment for COVID-19 has been discovered -so far. The current work describes the inhibition study of the SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase or 3CL M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; by natural and synthetic inhibitors, which include 2S albumin and flocculating protein from Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) and Suramin. Molecular Docking study was carried out using the programs like AutoDock 4.0, HADDOCK2.4, patchdock, pardock, and firedock. The global binding energy of Suramin, 2S albumin, and flocculating proteins were -41.96, -9.12, and -14.78 kJ/mol, respectively. The docking analysis indicates that all three inhibitors bind at the junction of domains II and III. The catalytic function of 3CL M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; is dependent on its dimeric form, and the flexibility of domain III is considered important for this dimerization. Our study showed that all three inhibitors reduce this flexibility and restrict their motion. The decrease in flexibility of domain III was further confirmed by analysis coming from Molecular dynamic simulation. The analysis results indicate that the temperature B-factor of the enzyme decreases tremendously when the inhibitors bind to it. This study will further explore the possibility of producing an effective treatment against COVID-19.","Ullah, A.; Ullah, K.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,473,1

In this systematic review, we examined how e-health applications are used to support person-centered health care at the time of COVID-19. Methodology: Literature was systematically searched without language restriction and publication status between January 1 and May 25, 2020, to describe e-health's support on the person-centered health care to control the COVID-19 pandemic. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and CINAHL, MedRxiv, and Web of Science were used. Two researchers independently assessed the eligibility of each retrieved record. All included studies were subsequently rescreened by the researchers. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Results: We identified 60 articles and selected 8 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies used e-health technologies to facilitate clinical decision support and team care. Patient's engagement and access to health care from their homes were enhanced using telehealth and mobile health. Electronic health records were used to avail reliable data to health care providers and health authorities to make evidence-based decisions. Conclusion: Although there are limited studies to evaluate the effectiveness of e-health technologies for person-centered health care, the reviewed studies indicated e-health's potentials to improve the quality of health care and personalized health systems during COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should be done to better understand applications of e-health to improve the quality of health care and patients' outcomes and evaluate its cost-effectiveness.","Tebeje, Tsion H; Klein, Jorn",Telemed. j. e. health,473,26

The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment has recently been suggested to influence HSC aging, however the mechanisms whereby BM stromal cells mediate this effect is unknown. Here we show that aging-associated decreased expression of CXCR4 expression on BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) plays a crucial role in the development of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) aging phenotype. The BM MSC from old mice was sufficient to drive a premature aging phenotype of young HSPC when cultured together ex vivo. The impaired ability of old MSC to support HSPC function is associated with reduced expression of CXCR4 on BM MSC of old mice. Deletion of the CXCR4 gene in young MSC accelerates an aging phenotype in these cells characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, senescence, and reduced proliferation. Culture of HSPC from young mice with CXCR4 deficient MSC also from young mice led to a premature aging phenotype in the young HSPC, as evidenced by reduced hematopoietic regeneration and enhanced myeloid differentiation. Mechanistically, CXCR4 signaling prevents BM MSC dysfunction by suppressing oxidative stress, as treatment of old or CXCR4 deficient MSC with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), improved their niche supporting activity, and attenuated the HSPC aging phenotype. Our studies suggest that age-associated reduction in CXCR4 expression on BM MSC impairs hematopoietic niche activity with increased ROS production, driving an HSC aging phenotype. Thus, modulation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in MSC may lead to novel interventions to alleviate the age-associated decline in immune/hematopoietic function.","Singh, Pratibha; Kacena, Melissa A; Orschell, Christie M; Pelus, Louis M",,473,16

Multivariate Cox regression and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were both used to identify high-risk factors for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. The prediction model was developed based on four high-risk factors. Multivariate analysis showed that comorbidity [hazard ratio (HR) 3.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-5.11], albumin (ALB) level (HR 3.67, 95% CI 1.91-7.02), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (HR 3.16, 95% CI 1.68-5.96), and age &#8805;60 years (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.43-3.73) were independent risk factors for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. OPLS-DA identified that the top five influencing parameters for COVID-19 severity were CRP, ALB, age &#8805;60 years, comorbidity, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. When incorporating the above four factors, the nomogram had a good concordance index of 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89) and had an optimal agreement between the predictive nomogram and the actual observation with a slope of 0.95 (R 2 = 0.89) in the 7-day prediction and 0.96 (R 2 = 0.92) in the 14-day prediction after 1,000 bootstrap sampling. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the COVID-19-American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) model was 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.90).

These behavioral adaptations counteract spontaneous self-touching reflex gestures. I propose to explore the mind-body experience generated by these gesture changes in this health context.Method&#160;: I conducted a qualitative study with nine nurses who volunteered as reinforcements. The semistructured interviews I carried out were analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach.Results&#160;: The perception of the risk of self-inoculation is not related to the level of virus exposure. Facial PPE is perceived both as reassuring and difficult to put up with. The experience of self-touches is influenced by the level of attention the subject pays to his or her face and by the medical background related to this. Three kinds of mind-body adaptations are used to control self-touching&#160;: control by avoidance, control by keeping one&#8217;s hands busy, and compensatory bodily strategies. The representations of the bodily self are modified in terms of gestures and of the feeling of humanness. This generates a form of bodily abandonment and a lived experience of soiled bodies.Conclusion&#160;: The results highlight the cognitive load involved in refraining from self-touching and with the wearing of facial PPE.

COVID-19 has claimed many lives across the globe and severely impacted the livelihood of a considerable section of the world's population. We are still in the process of finding optimal and effective solutions to control the pandemic and minimise its negative impacts. In the process of developing effective strategies to combat COVID-19, different countries have adapted diverse policies, strategies and activities and yet there are no universal or comprehensive solutions to the problem. In this context, this paper brings out a conceptual model of multistakeholder participation governance as an effective model to fight against COVID-19. Accordingly, the current study conducted a scientific review by examining multi-stakeholder disaster response strategies, particularly in relation to COVID-19. The study then presents a conceptual framework for multistakeholder participation governance as one of the effective models to fight against COVID-19. Subsequently, the article offers strategies for rebuilding the economy and healthcare system through multi-stakeholder participation, and gives policy directions/decisions based on evidence to save lives and protect livelihoods. The current study also provides evidence about multidimensional approaches and multi-diplomatic mechanisms during the COVID-19 crisis, in order to examine dimensions of multi-stakeholder participation in disaster management and to document innovative, collaborative strategic directions across the globe. The current research findings highlight the need for global collaboration by working together to put an end to this pandemic situation through the application of a Multi-Stakeholder Spatial Decision Support System (MS-SDSS).","Panneer, Sigamani; Kantamaneni, Komali; Pushparaj, Robert Ramesh Babu; Shekhar, Sulochana; Bhat, Lekha; Rice, Louis",,473,4

We performed longitudinal brief-access taste testing in female mice before, during, and after pregnancy, along with quantitative PCR on taste buds and morphological analysis of taste tissues from pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Sucrose licking response decreased progressively during pregnancy compared to that prior to mating, with partial recovery in the post-partum period. No change in taste morphology was evident between pregnant and non-pregnant mice, however a notable decrease in T1R3 sweet taste receptor mRNA expression was recorded in pregnant dams. We conclude that altered taste preferences during pregnancy likely result from changes in the expression profile of taste buds in the mother, which may promote a less healthy diet while expecting.","Choo, Ezen; Koh, Anna; Goodman, Jason; Bushnell, Jennifer; Mielke-Maday, Hanna; Merte, Bryan; Dando, Robin",Physiol Behav,473,16

METHODS: This study is an interrupted-time-series observational study of children presenting to 11 Canadian tertiary-care pediatric EDs. Data were grouped into weeks in 3 study periods: prepandemic (January 1, 2018-January 27, 2020), peripandemic (January 28, 2020-March 10, 2020), and early pandemic (March 11, 2020-April 30, 2020). These periods were compared with the same time intervals in the 2 preceding calendar years. Primary outcomes were number of ED visits per week. The secondary outcomes were triage acuity, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, length of hospital stay, ED revisits, and visits for trauma and mental health concerns. RESULTS: There were 577,807 ED visits (median age, 4.5 years; 52.9% male). Relative to the prepandemic period, there was a reduction [-58%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -63% to -51%] in the number of ED visits during the early-pandemic period, with concomitant higher acuity. There was a concurrent increase in the proportion of ward [odds ratio (OR), 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32-1.45] and intensive care unit (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) admissions, and trauma-related ED visits among children less than 10 years (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.45-1.56). Mental health-related visits in children declined in the early-pandemic period (in <10 years, -60%; 95% CI, -67% to -51%; in children &#8805;10 years: -56%; 95% CI, -63% to -47%) relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. There were no differences in mortality or length of stay; however, ED revisits within 72 hours were reduced during the early-pandemic period (percent change: -55%; 95% CI, -61% to -49%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, dramatic reductions in pediatric ED visits occurred across Canada. Children seeking ED care were sicker, and there was an increase in trauma-related visits among children more than 10 years of age, whereas mental health visits declined during the early-pandemic period.

In patients with chronic infection, prosthesis exchange is in theory the rule. However, this surgical approach is sometimes not desirable especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, as it could be associated with a dramatic loss of function, reduction of the bone stock, fracture, or peroperative death. We propose here to report different approaches that can help to maintain the function in such patients based on a pathophysiology-, multidisciplinary-, and an experience-based approach. METHODS: We describe the different points that are needed to treat such patients: (i) the multidisciplinary care management; (ii) understanding the mechanism of bacterial persistence; (iii) optimization of the conservative surgical approach; (iv) use of suppressive antimicrobial therapy (SAT); (v) implementation of innovative agents that could be used locally to target the biofilm. RESULTS: In France, a nation-wide network called CRIOAc has been created and funded by the French Health ministry to manage complex bone and joint infection. Based on the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of PJI, it seems to be feasible to propose conservative surgical treatment such as ""debridement antibiotics and implant retention"" (with or without soft-tissue coverage) followed by SAT to control the disease progression. Finally, there is a rational for the use of particular agents that have the ability to target the bacteria embedded in biofilm such as bacteriophages and phage lysins. DISCUSSION: This multistep approach is probably a key determinant to propose innovative management in patients with complex PJI, to improve the outcome. CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment has a high potential in patients with chronic PJI for whom explantation is not desirable. The next step will be to evaluate such practices in nation-wide clinical trials.","Ferry, Tristan; Batailler, Cécile; Brosset, Sophie; Kolenda, Camille; Goutelle, Sylvain; Sappey-Marinier, Elliot; Josse, Jérôme; Laurent, Frédéric; Lustig, Sébastien",SICOT J,473,16

The prediction of epidemic size, peak value, and peak time can help policymakers in correct decisions. In this study, deep learning is selected as a powerful tool for forecasting this epidemic in Isfahan. A combination of effective Social Determinant of Health (SDH) and the occurrences of COVID-19 data are used as spatiotemporal input by using time-series information from different locations. Different models are utilized, and the best performance is found to be for a tailored type of long short-term memory (LSTM). This new method incorporates mutual effect of all classes (confirmed/ death / recovered) in predication process. The future trajectory of the outbreak in Isfahan is forecasted with the proposed model. The paper demonstrates the positive effect of adding SDHs in pandemic prediction. Furthermore, the effectiveness of different SDHs is discussed, and the most effective terms are introduced. The method expresses high ability in both short- and long- term forecasting of the outbreak. The model proves that in predicting one class (like the number of confirmed cases), the effect of other accompanying numbers (like death and recovered cases) cannot be ignored. In conclusion, the superiorities of this model (particularity the long term predication ability) turn it into a reliable tool for helping the health decision makers.","Kafieh, Rahele; Saeedizadeh, Narges; Arian, Roya; Amini, Zahra; Serej, Nasim Dadashi; Vaezi, Atefeh; Javanmard, Shaghayegh Haghjooy",Chaos Solitons Fractals,473,30

Dichotomous variables of our outcomes of interest were analyzed using Maentel-Haenszel formula to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with random-effects modeling regardless of heterogeneity. Results Five studies with a total of 1190 patients and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The use of JAK inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28–0.93, P = 0.02;I2: 7.8%, P = 0.354) and clinical improvement (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.05–2.95, P = 0.032;I2: 26.4%, P = 0.253). The use of JAK inhibitors was not associated with a reduced risk of clinical deterioration (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28–1.19, P = 0.136;I2: 24.1%, P = 0.267). Conclusion The use of JAK inhibitors was significantly associated with a reduced risk of mortality, and clinical improvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Wijaya, Indra Andhika Rizky Huang Ian Purwiga Aga Budiman Kevin Yonatan Bashari Muhammad Hasan Reniarti Lelani Roesli Rully Marsis Amirullah",Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,473,1

It is critical to be aware of and timely recognize neurological and neuroradiological manifestations affecting patients with COVID-19, to minimize morbidity and mortality of affected patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to our Level 1 trauma and stroke center during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York from March 1st to May 30, 2020, with a positive test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented mainly with neurological findings and had acute radiological brain changes on Computed Tomography (CT) scan. Patients with known chronic neurological disease processes were excluded from the study. We obtained and reviewed demographics, complete blood count, metabolic panel, D-dimer, inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), imaging, and patient's hospital course. We reviewed the current literature on neuroimaging, pathophysiology, and their clinical correlations on COVID-19. This case series study was approved by our institutional review board. Result: A total of 16 patients were selected for our case series. The most common neuroimaging features on CT, were territorial to multifocal ischemic infarcts, followed by a combination of ischemia and acute white matter encephalopathic changes, followed by temporal lobe predominant focal or more generalized encephalopathy with both confluent and non-confluent patterns, isolated cortical or more extensive intracranial hemorrhages and some combination of ischemia or hemorrhage and white matter changes. All our patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), most of them had elevated inflammatory markers, and D dimer. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection is a multi-organ disease, which can manifest as rapidly progressive neurological disease beyond the more common pulmonary presentation. Early recognition of various neurological findings and neuroimaging patterns in these patients will enable timely diagnosis and rapid treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our retrospective study is limited due to small non-representative sample size, strict selection criteria likely underestimating the true extent of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, mono-modality imaging technique limited to predominantly CT scans and lack of CSF analysis in all except one patient. Multi-institutional, multi-modality, largescale studies are needed with radio-pathological correlation to better understand the complete spectrum of neurologic presentations in COVID-19 patients and study the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and CNS disease process.","Rehmani, Razia; Segan, Scott; Maddika, Srikanth Reddy; Lei, Yadanar Win; Broka, Andrea",Brain Behav Immun Health,473,15

COVID-19 has the potential to decimate surgical health care services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect health care workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for patients. Among these measures, the timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is paramount to ensure the use of protective measures and isolation of patients to prevent transmission to health care personnel caring for patients with an unknown COVID-19 status or contact during the pandemic. Besides molecular and antibody tests, chest computed tomography (CT) has been assessed as a potential tool to aid in the screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and could be valuable in the emergency care setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an umbrella review that aims to identify and summarize the available literature on the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 in trauma surgery patients requiring urgent care. The objective is to inform future recommendations on emergency care for this category of patients. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the L·OVE (Living Overview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, as well as individual studies of such design, if not included in the systematic reviews, that assessed the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in emergency trauma surgery patients. Critical appraisal of the included studies for risk of bias will be conducted. Data will be extracted using a standardized data extraction tool. Findings will be summarized narratively, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to grade the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in October 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021. The plan for dissemination is to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present our results at conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting health care workers from infection is essential. Up-to-date information on the efficacy of diagnostic tests for detecting COVID-19 is essential. This review will serve an important role as a thorough summary to inform evidence-based recommendations on establishing effective policy and clinical guideline recommendations.

They had no other known triggers for EM. One of them had a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, while the other three were negative. Skin biopsies from two patients showed features not typical of EM, such as deep perivascular and perieccrine infiltrate and absence of necrosis of keratinocytes. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein showed granular positivity in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands in both biopsies. All patients had an excellent outcome, and had minimal or no systemic symptoms. The coincidence of EM, a condition commonly related to viruses, and chilblains in the setting of COVID-19, and the positivity for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by immunohistochemistry strongly suggest a link between EM-like lesions and SARS-CoV-2.","Torrelo, Antonio; Andina, David; Santonja, Carlos; Noguera-Morel, Lucero; Bascuas-Arribas, Marta; Gaitero-Tristán, Jara; Alonso-Cadenas, José Antonio; Escalada-Pellitero, Silvia; Hernández-Martín, Ángela; de la Torre-Espi, Mercedes; Colmenero, Isabel",Pediatr Dermatol,473,1

As a consequence, industries, including the agri-food sector, have put in place preventive measures to deal with this pandemic on several fronts, including the use of hydroalcoholic products and bleach for personal and surface disinfection. These disinfection actions may eliminate or reduce the risk of coronavirus infection, but the increased use of these products by employees could lead to serious health problems and increase the occupational chemical risk in the event of uncontrolled exposure. In order to analyze this risk in the dairy industry in Morocco, we have launched a qualitative and quantitative study to identify and assess the severity of chemical risk to which its employees are exposed. This involves an analysis of the safety data sheets [MSDS] of the disinfectants used and a health and safety survey of the users of these products, particularly for hand disinfection. This analysis showed that this chemical risk is omnipresent and prevention measures are partially adopted. Indeed, the strengthening of health safety measures to combat COVID-19 has significantly increased this risk, resulting in a remarkable imbalance in the assessment and management of occupational risks in this industry. These results have led us to propose corrective and preventive measures against this risk to interested parties and to adopt an integrated management of food and occupational health risks in a single system. This is the use of the Risk Analysis-Critical Control Points (HACCP)-Tool for a First Risk Assessment by Activity Analysis (OPERA) approach, which we developed and proposed in a previous study, for a simplified management of chemical risk in the food industry, especially in small- and medium-sized enterprises.","Rachidi, Hafida; Hamdaoui, Samir; Merimi, Imane; Bengourram, Jamae; Latrache, Hassan",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Growing epidemiological studies have depicted atherosclerosis as a comorbid factor of COVID-19. Though both these diseases are triggered via inflammatory rage that leads to injury of healthy tissues, the molecular linkage between them and their co-influence in causing fatality is not yet understood. METHODS: We have retrieved the data of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both atherosclerosis and COVID-19 from publicly available microarray and RNA-Seq datasets. We then reconstructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) for these diseases from protein-protein interaction data of corresponding DEGs. Using RegNetwork and TRRUST, we mapped the transcription factors (TFs) in atherosclerosis and their targets (TGs) in COVID-19 PPIN. RESULTS: From the atherosclerotic PPIN, we have identified 6 hubs (TLR2, TLR4, EGFR, SPI1, MYD88 and IRF8) as differentially expressed TFs that might control the expression of their 17 targets in COVID-19 PPIN. The important target proteins include IL1B, CCL5, ITGAM, IFIT3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL8. Consequent functional enrichment analysis of these TGs have depicted inflammatory responses to be overrepresented among the gene sets. CONCLUSION: Finally, analyzing the DEGs in cardiomyocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2, we have concluded that MYD88 is a crucial linker of atherosclerosis and COVID-19, the co-existence of which lead to fatal outcomes. Anti-inflammatory therapy targeting MYD88 could be a potent strategy for combating this comorbidity.","Das, Deepyaman; Podder, Soumita",Comput Biol Med,473,21

BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nursing Division at the Israeli Ministry of Health and partners conducted a study to examine the nurses' perceptions towards a set of personal and professional circumstances that may affect their performance. METHOD: A cross-sectional Web-based study was conducted in Israel. Study' participants included 817 community and hospital nurses. The Occupational Commitment Scale for Health Professionals during pandemic (PanHP-OCS) was used to gather data. Univariate and multivariate analyses explored associations between the PanHP-OCS score and demographic and professional variables. RESULTS: About 40% of 817 respondents reported having managerial roles (n = 320). Those who received specific pandemic-focused training had significantly better PanHP-OCS scores (p < .001). Most respondents expected their organisation to provide them emotional support. Linear regression explored the organisational commitment factor as the greatest contributor to nurses' professional commitment (ß = 0.284, p < .001). CONCLUSION: To enhance the nurses' professional commitment during the COVID-19 pandemic, training and emotional support must be emphasized in all types of nurses' workplaces. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: In a pandemic, health organisations must provide dedicated pandemic training, including proactive emotional support for nurses. Special attention should be given to community care.","Goldfarb, Netali; Grinstein-Cohen, Orli; Shamian, Judith; Schwartz, Dagan; Zilber, Rama; Hazan-Hazoref, Rivka; Goldberg, Shoshy; Cohen, Odeya",J. nurs. manag,473,6

We conducted a serosurveillance using antibody testing in an area where official report of COVID-19 infection is not done yet. Blood samples were obtained from 1404 healthcare workers (41 ± 11 years) in our hospital on May 29-31, 2020. First, the potential infection frequency was confirmed using two quantitative antibody tests. In addition, the usefulness of rapid antibody kit testing for COVID-19 serosurveillance was examined. A COVID-19-indected case was defined as showing positive results in both quantitative tests. None of 1404 samples had positive results from the two quantitative tests. The false positive rates were 0.36% and 0.07%, whereas those in rapid antibody kits were 3.3% and 3.0%. In conclusion, as of May, 2020, potential spread mainly by asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19 was not found in our local area where there was no official report of COVID-19, even if the PCR testing rate was low. Rapid antibody kits might not be useful due to the high false positive rate in an area with a low incidence of COVID-19 infected individuals.","Nakamura, Akihiro; Ando, Sanae; Endo, Hideaki; Sato, Ryoichi",J. med. virol,473,28

An intelligent system can help the radiologists to detect COVID-19 from these CXR images which can come in handy at remote locations in many developing nations. In this work, we propose a pipeline that uses CXR images to detect COVID-19 infection. The features from the CXR images were extracted and the relevant features were then selected using Hybrid Social Group Optimization algorithm. The selected features were then used to classify the CXR images using a number of classifiers.

AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the incidence, characteristics and clinical outcome of older adults with atypical presentations of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of adults &#8805; 65 years with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution between 1 March and 24 April 2020 was performed. Patients were categorised into typical or atypical groups based on primary presenting complaint in the community. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients (mean age 81 ± 8 years; 62 male) were included. Seventy-three (60%) were categorised into the typical group and 49 (40%) into the atypical group. In the atypical group, common presenting complaints were fall in 18 (36%), reduced mobility or generalised weakness in 18 (36%) and delirium in 11 (22%). Further assessment by paramedics and on admission found 32 (65%) to have typical features of COVID-19, fever being the most common, and 22 (44%) were hypoxic. This subset had worse outcomes than those in the typical group with a mortality rate of 50% versus 38%, respectively, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.27). No significant difference in mortality or length of hospital stay between the groups was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Older patients with atypical presentation of COVID-19 in the community are equally susceptible to poor outcomes. Early detection may improve outcomes and limit community transmission. Primary care practitioners should be vigilant and consider prompt onward referral.","Gan, Jasmine Ming; Kho, Jason; Akhunbay-Fudge, Michelle; Choo, Hwei Ming; Wright, Melanie; Batt, Farzana; Mandal, Amit K J; Chauhan, Rahul; Missouris, Constantinos G",Ir. j. med. sci,473,1

There is a wide variety of face masks available on the market for various applications, but they are all passive in nature, i.e., simply act as air filters for the nasal passage and/or mouth. In this paper, we present a new""active mask""paradigm, in which the wearable device is equipped with smart sensors and actuators to both detect the presence of airborne pathogens in real time and take appropriate action to mitigate the threat. The proposed approach is based on a closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes close to the mask and then makes intelligent decisions to reduce their concentrations. This paper presents a specific implementation of this concept in which the on-board controller determines ambient air quality via a commercial particulate matter sensor, and if necessary activates a piezoelectric actuator that generates a mist spray to load these particles, thus causing them to fall to the ground. The proposed system communicates with the user via a smart phone application that provides various alerts, including notification of the need to recharge and/or decontaminate the mask prior to reuse. The application also enables a user to override the on-board control system and manually control the mist generator if necessary. Experimental results from a functional prototype demonstrate significant reduction in airborne particulate counts near the mask when the active protection system is enabled.","Masna, Naren Vikram Raj; Kalavakonda, Rohan Reddy; Dizon, Reiner; Bhuniaroy, Anamika; Mandal, Soumyajit; Bhunia, Swarup",,473,24

Cladribine tablets is a disease-modifying treatment (DMT) indicated for highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) as defined by clinical or imaging features. Treatment with cladribine tablets is effective and well tolerated in patients with active MS disease and have a low burden of monitoring during and following treatment. In this article, an expert group of specialist neurologists involved in the care of patients with MS in the United Arab Emirates provides their consensus recommendations for the practical use of cladribine tablets according to the presenting phenotype of patients with RRMS. The IRT approach may be especially useful for patients with highly active MS insufficiently responsive to treatment with a first-line DMT, those who are likely to adhere poorly to a continuous therapeutic regimen, treatment-naïve patients with high disease activity at first presentation, or patients planning a family who are prepared to wait until at least 6 months after the end of treatment. Information available to date does not suggest an adverse interaction between cladribine tablets and COVID-19 infection. Data are unavailable at this time regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in patients treated with cladribine tablets. Robust immunological responses to COVID-19 infection or to other vaccines have been observed in patients receiving this treatment, and treatment with cladribine tablets per se should not represent a barrier to this vaccination.","Inshasi, Jihad S; Alfahad, Sarmed; Alsaadi, Taoufik; Hassan, Ali; Zein, Tayseer; Mifsud, Victoria Ann; Nouri, Suzan Ibrahim; Shakra, Mustafa; Shatila, Ahmed Osman; Szolics, Miklos; Thakre, Mona; Kumar, Ajit; Boshra, Amir",,473,1

We hypothesized that overburdened hospital resources by the extent of the pandemic rather than the disease per se might play an important role on unfavorable prognosis. We sought to determine the outcome of such patients admitted to the general ICUs of a hospital with sufficient resources. We performed a prospective observational study of adult patients with COVID-19 consecutively admitted to COVID-designated ICUs at Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece. Among 50 patients, ICU and hospital mortality was 32% (16/50). Median PaO2/FiO2 was 121 mmHg (interquartile range (IQR), 86-171 mmHg) and most patients had moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

In our study, a total of 38,911 individuals (61% female, 15% over 65) have been enrolled between March 25, 2020 and April 3, 2021, with 1,118 reported testing positive and 7,032 negative for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR swab test. We propose an explainable gradient boosting prediction model based on decision trees for the detection of COVID-19 infection that can adapt to the absence of self-reported symptoms and to the available sensor data, and that can explain the importance of each feature and the post-test-behavior for the individuals. We tested it in a cohort of symptomatic individuals who exhibited an AUC of 0.83 [0.81-0.85], or AUC=0.78 [0.75-0.80] when considering only data before the test date, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithm in these conditions. The analysis of all individuals (including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic) when self-reported symptoms were excluded provided an AUC of 0.78 [0.76-0.79], or AUC of 0.70 [0.69-0.72] when considering only data before the test date. Extending the use of predictive algorithms for detection of COVID-19 infection based only on passively monitored data from any device, we showed that it is possible to scale up this platform and apply the algorithm in other settings where self-reported symptoms can not be collected.","Gadaleta, Matteo; Radin, Jennifer M.; Baca-Motes, Katie; Ramos, Edward; Kheterpal, Vik; Topol, Eric J.; Steinhubl, Steven R.; Quer, Giorgio",,473,5

The objectives of our study were to describe patterns of COVID-19 testing among LGBTQ+ people and to differentiate rates of COVID-19 testing and test results by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Participants residing in the United States and US territories (N = 1090) aged &#8805;18 completed an internet-based survey from May through July 2020 that assessed COVID-19 testing and test results and sociodemographic characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). We analyzed data on receipt and results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19 in relation to sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 1090 participants, 182 (16.7%) received a PCR test; of these, 16 (8.8%) had a positive test result. Of the 124 (11.4%) who received an antibody test, 45 (36.3%) had antibodies. Rates of PCR testing were higher among participants who were non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born (16.3%) and employed full-time or part-time (18.5%) versus unemployed (10.8%). Antibody testing rates were higher among gay cisgender men (17.2%) versus other SOGI groups, non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born participants, employed (12.6%) versus unemployed participants, and participants residing in the Northeast (20.0%) versus other regions. Among SOGI groups with sufficient cell sizes (n > 10), positive PCR results were highest among cisgender gay men (16.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The differential patterns of testing and positivity, particularly among gay men in our sample, confirm the need to create COVID-19 public health messaging and programming that attend to the LGBTQ+ population.","Martino, Richard J; Krause, Kristen D; Griffin, Marybec; LoSchiavo, Caleb; Comer-Carruthers, Camilla; Karr, Anita G; Bullock, Allie F; Halkitis, Perry N",Public Health Rep,473,12

Consequences may be more evident in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcome. METHODS: We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain. Among them, 700 (32.4%) were diabetics. Patients with and without diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and co-morbidities. Diabetics had a higher mortality (3.0% vs. 1.0%; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (1.9% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.001). Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease (mortality 6.9% vs 1.7% [p < 0.001] and cardiovascular mortality 4.9% vs 0.9% [p = 0.002] in patients with and without diabetes, respectively). In the multivariable analysis, diabetes remained as an independent risk factor both for overall and cardiovascular mortality. No significant interaction was found with other clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Among patients in whom an elective invasive cardiac procedure is cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic, mortality and cardiovascular mortality is higher in patients with diabetes, irrespectively on other clinical conditions. These procedures should not be cancelled in patients with diabetes.","Moreno, Raúl; Díez, José-Luis; Diarte, José-Antonio; Salinas, Pablo; de la Torre Hernández, José María; Andres-Cordón, Juan F; Trillo, Ramiro; Briales, Juan Alonso; Amat-Santos, Ignacio; Romaguera, Rafael; Díaz, José-Francisco; Vaquerizo, Beatriz; Ojeda, Soledad; Cruz-González, Ignacio; Morena-Salas, Daniel; Pérez de Prado, Armando; Sarnago, Fernando; Portero, Pilar; Gutierrez-Barrios, Alejandro; Alfonso, Fernando; Bosch, Eduard; Pinar, Eduardo; Ruiz-Arroyo, José-Ramón; Ruiz-Quevedo, Valeriano; Jiménez-Mazuecos, Jesús; Lozano, Fernando; Rumoroso, José-Ramón; Novo, Enrique; Irazusta, Francisco J; García Del Blanco, Bruno; Moreu, José; Ballesteros-Pradas, Sara M; Frutos, Araceli; Villa, Manuel; Alegría-Barrero, Eduardo; Lázaro, Rosa; Paredes, Emilio",Cardiovasc Diabetol,473,8

This paper aims to present an innovative methodology to increase student awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability. Design/methodology/approach This method uses a videogame and two board games to simulate three spheres of economic interaction, namely, local, national and international. For every sphere, three key economic sectors and their relationships with fundamental sustainable development goals (SDGs) are addressed. This study uses pre- and post-simulation data to analyze the students' perceptions regarding the usefulness of the simulations and their awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability. Findings The implementation of this teaching and learning method demonstrated not only that active learning can effectively increase student awareness about the potential social and environmental consequences of economic decisions but also that students perceive games and simulations as useful teaching and learning tools. Social implications Students in these areas need to learn not only how to transform original ideas into successful projects but also to align financial results with social and environmental objectives. The methodology presented in this research allows to enhance learning from a multi-disciplinary perspective, helping the students to analyze different economic sectors and their connection with a number of SDGs through the lens of public economics. Originality/value The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has shown the effects of a global pandemic at the economic, social and environmental levels.

We aimed to assess gender-based desparities during COVID-19 in Jordan in terms of health indices, mental well-being and economic burden. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 1300 participants &#8805;18 years living in Jordan were selected using stratified random sampling. Data were collected via telephone interviews in this cross-sectional study. Chi-square was used to test age and gender differences according to demographics, economic burden, and health indices (access to healthcare, health insurance, antenatal and reproductive services). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the beta-coefficient (ß) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of factors correlated with mental well-being, assessed by patients' health questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4). RESULTS: 656 (50.5%) men and 644 (49.5%) women completed the interview. Three-fourths of the participants had health insurance during the COVID-19 crisis. There was no significant difference in healthcare coverage or access between women and men (p > 0.05). Half of pregnant women were unable to access antenatal care. Gender was a significant predictor of higher PHQ-4 scores (women vs. men: ß: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.54-1.22). Among women, age &#8805; 60 years and being married were associated with significantly lower PHQ-4 scores. Only 0.38% of the overall participants lost their jobs; however, 8.3% reported a reduced payment. More women (13.89%) were not paid during the crisis as compared with men (6.92%) (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed no gender differences in healthcare coverage or access during the COVID-19 crisis generally. Women in Jordan are experiencing worse outcomes in terms of mental well-being and economic burden. Policymakers should give priority to women's mental health and antenatal and reproductive services. Financial security should be addressed in all Jordanian COVID-19 national plans because the crisis appears widening the gender gap in the economy.","Abufaraj, Mohammad; Eyadat, Zaid; Al-Sabbagh, Mohammed Qussay; Nimer, Abdullah; Moonesar, Immanuel Azaad; Yang, Lin; Al Khatib, Walid; Al-Qutob, Ra039; eda,",Int J Equity Health,473,16

We aim to describe the incidence, associated variables, and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for all critically ill adult patients (&#8805;18 years old) admitted to the ICU at a large academic medical center with confirmed COVID-19 between March 13, 2020 and April 18, 2020 were prospectively collected. Patients with serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations greater than 1000 U/L were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Patients were further stratified as having moderate (serum CK concentration 1000-4999 U/L) or severe (serum CK concentration &#8805;5000 U/L) rhabdomyolysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify outcomes and variables associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis. RESULTS: Of 235 critically ill COVID-19 patients, 114 (48.5%) met diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis. Patients with rhabdomyolysis more often required mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001), prone positioning (P < 0.001), pharmacological paralysis (P < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (P = 0.010), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (P = 0.025). They also had longer median ICU length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001) and hospital LOS (P < 0.001). No difference in mortality was observed. Male sex, patients with morbid obesity, SOFA score, and prone positioning were independently associated with rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of critically ill COVID-19 patients in our cohort met diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis. Male sex, morbid obesity, SOFA score, and prone position were independently associated with rhabdomyolysis.

Many clinical trials on COVID-19 have been registered, and we aim to review the study characteristics and provide guidance for future trials to avoid duplicated effort. Methods: Studies on COVID-19 registered before March 3rd, 2020 on eight registry platforms worldwide were searched and the data of design, participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. Results: Three hundred and ninety-three studies were identified and 380 (96.7%) were from mainland China, while 3 in Japan, 3 in France, 2 in the US, and 3 were international collaborative studies. Two hundred and sixty-six (67.7%) aimed at therapeutic effect, others were for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, etc. Two hundred and two studies (51.4%) were randomized controlled trials. Two third of therapeutic studies tested Western medicines including antiviral drugs (17.7%), stem cell and cord blood therapy (10.2%), chloroquine and derivatives (8.3%), 16 (6.0%) on Chinese medicines, and 73 (27.4%) on integrated therapy of Western and Chinese medicines. Thirty-one studies among 266 therapeutic studies (11.7%) used mortality as primary outcome, while the most designed secondary outcomes were symptoms and signs (47.0%). Half of the studies (45.5%) had not started recruiting till March 3rd.

The microbiome in these organs, including the bacteriome and virome, responds to infection and might also influence disease progression and treatment outcome. In a cohort of 13 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China, we observed that the gut virome and bacteriome in the COVID-19 patients were notably different from those of five healthy controls. We identified a bacterial dysbiosis signature by observing reduced diversity and viral shifts in patients, and among the patients, the bacterial/viral compositions were different between patients of different severities, although these differences are not entirely distinguishable from the effect of antibiotics. Severe cases of COVID-19 exhibited a greater abundance of opportunistic pathogens but were depleted for butyrate-producing groups of bacteria compared with mild to moderate cases. We replicated our findings in a mouse COVID-19 model, confirmed virome differences and bacteriome dysbiosis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and observed that immune/infection-related genes were differentially expressed in gut epithelial cells during infection, possibly explaining the virome and bacteriome dynamics. Our results suggest that the components of the microbiome, including the bacteriome and virome, are affected by SARS-CoV-2 infections, while their compositional signatures could reflect or even contribute to disease severity and recovery processes.","Cao, Jiabao; Wang, Cheng; Zhang, Yuqing; Lei, Guanglin; Xu, Kun; Zhao, Na; Lu, Jingjing; Meng, Fanping; Yu, Linxiang; Yan, Jin; Bai, Changqing; Zhang, Shaogeng; Zhang, Ning; Gong, Yuhuan; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Yi; Chen, Zhu; Dai, Lianpan; Wang, Jun; Yang, Penghui",Gut Microbes,473,24

We assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic in Turkey with our constructed uncertainty index. Design/methodology/approach: In order to obtain the EUI, this study employs a dimension reduction method of PCA using 14 macroeconomic indicators that spans from January 2011 to July 2020. The first principal component is picked as a proxy for the economic uncertainty in Turkey which explains 52% of total variation in entire sample. In the second part of our analysis, with our constructed EUI we conduct a structural vector autoregressions (SVAR) analysis simulating the Covid-19-induced uncertainty shock to the real economy. Findings: Our EUI sensitively detects important economic/political events in Turkey as well as Covid-19-induced uncertainty rising to extremely high levels during the outbreak. Our SVAR results imply a significant decline in economic activity and in the sub-indices as well. Namely, industrial production drops immediately by 8.2% and cumulative loss over 8 months will be 15% on average. The losses in the capital and intermediate goods are estimated to be 18 and 25% respectively. Forecast error variance decomposition results imply that uncertainty shocks preserve its explanatory power in the long run, and intermediate goods production is more vulnerable to uncertainty shocks than overall industrial production and capital goods production. Practical implications: The results indicate that monetary and fiscal policy should aim to decrease uncertainty during Covid-19. Moreover, since investment expenditures are affected severely during the outbreak, policymakers should impose investment subsidies. Originality/value: This is the first study constructing a novel EUI which sensitively captures the critical economic/political events in Turkey. Moreover, we assess the impact of Covid-19-driven uncertainty on Turkish Economy with a SVAR model. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mugaloglu, E.; Polat, A.

This study focuses on the implications of COVID-19-related measures on three population groups in India, including (1) migrant laborers (of which a majority come from Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), as well as Other Backward Classes (OBCs)), (2) children from low-income families and, (3) refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a sequential mixed-method research design. A desk-based study of a selection of government reports was undertaken on the COVID-19-related mitigation measures. The desk study was followed by in-depth interviews with purposively recruited high-ranking experts in specific sectors of policy implementation and service delivery across the country. Findings: The outcomes of this study shed light on (1) the most urgent needs that need to be addressed per population group, (2) the variety of state-level responses as well as best practices observed to deal with mitigation issues and (3) opportunities for quick relief as well as more long-term solutions. Practical implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only reduced people's means of maintaining a livelihood but has simultaneously revealed some of India's long-standing problems with infrastructure and resource distribution in a range of sectors, including nutrition and health, education, etc. There is an urgent need to construct effective pathways to trace and respond to those people who are desolate, and to learn from – and support – good practices at the grassroot level.

The potentially fatal coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by air droplets and airborne as the main transmission modes, clearly induces a spectrum of respiratory clinical manifestations, but it also affects the immune, gastrointestinal, hematological, nervous, and renal systems. The dramatic scale of disorders and complications arises from the inadequacy of current treatments and absence of a vaccine and specific anti-COVID-19 drugs to suppress viral replication, inflammation, and additional pathogenic conditions.

For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed. Results: CCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex. Conclusions: Common cold coronavirus spike IgG antibodies anti-HCoV-OC43 and anti-HCoV-HKU1 may target a common domain for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. They provide a promising therapeutic target for monoclonal antibody production.","Greenbaum, Uri; Klein, Kimberly; Martinez, Fernando; Song, Juhee; Thall, Peter F; Ramdial, Jeremy L; Knape, Cristina; Aung, Fleur M; Scroggins, Jamie; Knopfelmacher, Adriana; Mulanovich, Victor; Borjan, Jovan; Adachi, Javier; Muthu, Mayoora; Leung, Cerena; Medina, Mayrin Correa; Champlin, Richard; Olson, Amanda; Alousi, Amin; Rezvani, Katayoun; Shpall, Elizabeth J",Front Immunol,473,30

Design, setting and participants: Analysis of all confirmed COVID-19 cases diagnosed in NSW from 1 January to 31 May 2020 extracted from the NSW Notifiable Conditions Information Management System and linked to routinely collected hospitalisation data. Outcome measures: In-patient hospitalisations and hospital service utilisation details. Results: There were 3,101 COVID-19 cases diagnosed between 1 January and 31 May 2020 in NSW: mean age 46.7 years, 50.5% were females. Overall, 12.5% (n = 389) had a record of inpatient hospitalisation, 4.2% (n = 130) were admitted to ICU and 1.9% (n = 58) received ventilation. Among adult cases, hospital and ICU admission rates increased with increasing age: 2.9% of those aged 20-29 years were hospitalised, increasing to 46.6% of those aged 80-89 years; 0.6% of those aged 20-29 years were admitted to ICU, increasing to 11.2% of those aged 70-79 years. The median time from symptoms to hospitalisation was seven days (IQR 4-11). The median time in hospital was nine days (IQR 4-20), and in ICU six days (IQR 2-15); the median time in hospital increased with older age. Almost half (49.4%) of those hospitalised with a diagnostic code had pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infection and another 36.6% had an upper respiratory tract infection or other known COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious infection particularly in older adults. During January to May of 2020, 1 in 8 of those diagnosed in NSW were hospitalised. While this partly reflects the cautious approach to case management in the initial phase of the pandemic, it also demonstrates the large potential impact of COVID-19 on Australian health services and need for continuing mitigation strategies.","Liu, Bette; Spokes, Paula; Alfaro-Ramirez, Maria; Ward, Kate; Kaldor, John",,473,20

SUMMARY: A 72-year-old White man was started on dulaglutide for outpatient management of type 2 diabetes, in addition to his existing antihyperglycemic regimen of metformin, glipizide, pioglitazone, and insulin glargine. His glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration improved from 8.2% to 7.2% with the addition of dulaglutide. Furthermore, the use of dulaglutide did not lead to weight loss. After 16 months of treatment with dulaglutide, he presented to the emergency room with nausea, loss of appetite, and progressive sharp, nonradiating right upper quadrant pain. Based on symptom presentation, laboratory workup, and computed tomography scan results, acute cholecystitis was diagnosed. He underwent a cholecystectomy to remove what was found to be a gangrenous gallbladder. Per documented surgical dictation from the cholecystectomy, the gallbladder was removed, but portions of the biliary tree were left intact. The patient was continued on dulaglutide postoperatively without recurrence of bile stones, biliary tree disease, or abdominal symptoms at 8 months after initial cholecystitis incident. CONCLUSION: A male patient with possible dulaglutide-induced cholecystitis was successfully continued on dulaglutide therapy post cholecystectomy without recurrent complications within the biliary tract.","Butler, Jared; Bjurstrom, Marysue; Marceau, Anna",Am J Health Syst Pharm,473,20

To limit virus diffusion among healthcare workers the use of personal protective equipment and screening tests are highly advised; also, isolation of virus positive professionals while monitoring their health condition is recommended. This study aims to assess, in a cohort of COVID-19 positive quarantined healthcare workers, the perceived source of infection and exposure risk as well as the clinical evolution of the disease through a surveillance interview. METHODS: A retrospective observational study accounting 896 observations on 93 healthcare professionals tested positive for COVID-19. Data were collected from the Nursing and Technical Directorate of Romagna, Ravenna, Local Health Company, Italy. RESULTS: 99.5% of the positive workers accepted phone interviews with management staff. 2.6% of workers were positive with increasing records in the specialist medical area. Nurses and social health professionals were mostly affected. Patient exposure at a distance <1 m and a contact time > 2 hours was the first cause of positivity. In COVID-19 and territorial emergency departments, the first cause was the contact with colleagues. At the time of the infection, most of the staff wore a surgical mask. Cough, asthenia, fever, anosmia, dysgeusia, and rhinitis were common symptoms. Asymptomatic percentage was about 10%. The self-perceived physical condition was high (>7) and improved during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: The diffusion rate of COVID-19 among healthcare workers is relatively low, probably due to the use of personal protective equipment. The distancing, also among colleagues, is a fundamental measure to reduce the possibility of infection. Symptoms are mild and can be controlled by surveillance measures. Constant contact with the organization is an essential strategy for promoting recovering of workers and reducing the spread of the virus within the healthcare organization.","Rubbi, Ivan; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea; Brighenti, Aura; Fanelli, Marcella; Gualandi, Patrizia; Nanni, Eleonora; D039,; Antoni, Viviana; Fabbri, Cristina",Acta Biomed,473,24

INTERVENTIONS: Participants were given a hypothetical COVID-19 PCR test result for 'John' who was presented as having a 50% chance of having COVID-19 based on symptoms alone. Participants were randomised to receive either a positive or negative result for 'John', then randomised again to receive either no more information, or text information on the interpretation of COVID-19 test results copied in September 2020 from the public websites of the UK's National Health Service, the USA's Centers for Disease Control, New Zealand's Ministry of Health or a modified version of the UK's wording. Information identifying the source of the wording was removed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were asked 'What is your best guess as to the percent chance that John actually had COVID-19 at the time of his test, given his result?'; questions about their feelings of trustworthiness in the result, their perceptions of the quality of the underlying evidence and what action they felt 'John' should take in the light of his result. RESULTS: Of those presented with a positive COVID-19 test result for 'John', the mean estimate of the probability that he had the virus was 73% (71.5%-74.5%); for those presented with a negative result, 38% (36.7%-40.0%). There was no main effect of information (wording) on these means. However, those participants given the official information from the UK website, which did not mention the possibility of false negatives or false positives, were more likely to give a categorical (100% or 0%) answer (UK: 68/343, 19.8% (15.9%-24.4%); control group: 42/356, 11.8% (8.8%-15.6%)); the reverse was true for those viewing the New Zealand (NZ) wording, which highlighted the uncertainties most explicitly (20/345: 5.8% (3.7%-8.8%)). Aggregated across test result (positive/negative), there was a main effect of wording (p<0.001) on beliefs about how 'John' should behave, with those seeing the NZ wording marginally more likely to agree that 'John' should continue to self-isolate than those viewing the control or the UK wording. The proportion of participants who felt that a symptomatic individual who tests negative definitely should not self-isolate was highest among those viewing the UK wording (31/178, 17.4% (12.5%-23.7%)), and lowest among those viewing the NZ wording (6/159, 3.8% (1.6%-8.2%)). Although the NZ wording was rated harder to understand, participants reacted to the uncertainties given in the text in the expected direction: there was a small main effect of wording on trust in the result (p=0.048), with people perceiving the test result as marginally less trustworthy after having read the NZ wording compared with the UK wording. Positive results were generally viewed as more trustworthy and as having higher quality of evidence than negative results (both p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The public's default assessment of the face value of both the positive and negative test results (control group) indicate an awareness that test results are not perfectly accurate. Compared with other messaging tested, participants shown the UK's 2020 wording about the interpretation of the test results appeared to interpret the results as more definitive than is warranted. Wording that acknowledges uncertainty can help people to have a more nuanced and realistic understanding of what a COVID-19 test result means, which supports decision making and behavioural response.

Accordingly, there is a need for new treatments that can limit the generation of new waves T cell autoreactivity that drive disease progression. Notably, immune cells express GABAA-receptors (GABAA-Rs) whose activation has anti-inflammatory effects such that GABA administration can ameliorate disease in models of type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19. Here, we show that oral GABA, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), does not affect the course of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, oral administration of the BBB-permeable GABAA-R-specific agonist homotaurine ameliorates monophasic EAE, as well as advanced-stage relapsing-remitting EAE (RR-EAE). Homotaurine treatment beginning after the first peak of paralysis reduced the spreading of Th17 and Th1 responses from the priming immunogen to a new myelin T cell epitope within the CNS. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) isolated from homotaurine-treated mice displayed an attenuated ability to promote autoantigen-specific T cell proliferation. The ability of homotaurine treatment to limit epitope spreading within the CNS, along with its safety record, makes it an excellent candidate to help treat MS and other inflammatory disorders of the CNS.","Tian, Jide; Song, Min; Kaufman, Daniel L",Sci Rep,473,29

This study aimed to investigate whether high dose XR effectively attenuates post-operative hypersensitivity better than low dose XR in a mouse model of incisional pain. Methods: Mice (n = 44) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (a) saline (1 ml/kg SC, once); (b) sustained release buprenorphine (Bup-SR, 1 mg/kg SC, once); (c) low dose extended-release buprenorphine (XR-lo, 3.25 mg/kg SC, once); (d) high dose extended-release buprenorphine (XR-hi, 6.5 mg/kg SC, once). On days -1, 0 (4 hours), 1, 2, and 3, mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities were evaluated, and plasma buprenorphine concentrations were measured. Results: Mechanical (days 0-2) and thermal (days 0-1) hypersensitivities were observed in the saline group. Bup-SR, XR-lo, and XR-hi attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity on days 0, 1, and 2. None of the treatment groups, except XR-Lo on day 0, attenuated thermal hypersensitivity on days 0 or 1. Plasma buprenorphine concentration peaked at 4 hours (day 0) in all treatment groups and remained greater than 1 ng/mL on days 0-2. No abnormal clinical observations or gross pathologic findings were seen in any groups. Conclusion: The results indicate XR-hi did not effectively attenuate post-operative hypersensitivity better than XR-lo. Thus both 3.25 and 6.5 mg/kg XR are recommended for attenuating post-operative hypersensitivity for at least up to 48 hours in mice.","Navarro, Kaela; Jampachaisri, Katechan; Huss, Monika; Pacharinsak, Cholawat",Animal Model Exp Med,473,16

A few small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro are in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments and more inhibitors are being developed. One limiting factor for 3CLpro inhibitors development is that the cellular activities of such inhibitors have to be evaluated in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) or BSL-4 laboratory. Here, we design genetically encoded biosensors that can be used in BSL-2 laboratories to set up cell-based assays for 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. The biosensors were constructed by linking a green fluorescent protein (GFP2) to the N-terminus and a Renilla luciferase (RLuc8) to the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, with the linkers derived from the cleavage sequences of 3CLpro. After over-expression of the biosensors in HEK293 cells, 3CLpro can be released from GFP2 and RLuc by self-cleavage, resulting in a decrease of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal. Using one of these biosensors, pBRET-10, we evaluated the cellular activities of several 3CLpro inhibitors. These inhibitors restored the BRET signal by blocking the proteolysis of pBRET-10, and their relative activities measured using pBRET-10 were consistent with their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities reported previously. We conclude that the biosensor pBRET-10 is a useful tool for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor discovery. Furthermore, our strategy can be used to design biosensors for other viral proteases that share the same activation mechanism as 3CLpro, such as HIV protease PR and HCV protease NS3.

Oncologists were advised to prioritize chemotherapy based on the absolute benefit that the patient may receive, which outbalances the risks of Covid-19 infection. The results of this study will allow re-examination of how to approach cancer care during the pandemic and ultimately, help optimize treatment recommendations during this crisis. AIM: This study described the factors contributing to treatment delays during the pandemic and their impact on disease progression. MATERIALS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study was done in St. Luke's Medical Center, a private tertiary healthcare institution based in Metro Manila, Philippines, composed of two facilities in Quezon City and Global City. Patients with solid malignancy with ongoing systemic cancer treatment prior to the peak of the pandemic were identified. Clinical characteristics and treatment data were compared between those with delayed and continued treatments. Multivariate analysis was done to determine factors for treatment delays and association of delays with disease progression and Covid-19 infection. Of the 111 patients, 33% experienced treatment delays and 67% continued treatment during the pandemic. There was a higher percentage of patients on palliative intent who underwent treatment delay, and 64% of delays were due to logistic difficulties. Treatment delays were significantly associated with disease progression (p < .0001). There was no evidence of association between delay or continuation of treatment and risk of Covid-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in Covid-19 infection between those who delayed and continued treatment during the pandemic; however, treatment delays were associated with a higher incidence of disease progression. Our findings suggest that the risks of cancer progression due to treatment delays exceed the risks of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients implying that beneficial treatment should not be delayed as much as possible. Logistic hindrances were also identified as the most common cause of treatment delay among Filipino patients, suggesting that efforts should be focused into assistance programs that will mitigate these barriers to ensure continuity of cancer care services during the pandemic.","Pandy, Jessa Gilda; Maaño, Omar; Balolong-Garcia, Joanmarie C; Datukan, Jay T Y",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),473,20

We made air liquid interface (ALI) cultures from HNOs and assessed infection with two major human respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infected HNO-ALI cultures recapitulate aspects of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral shedding, ciliary damage, innate immune responses, and mucus hyper-secretion. Next, we evaluated the feasibility of the HNO-ALI respiratory virus model system to test the efficacy of palivizumab to prevent RSV infection. Palivizumab was administered in the basolateral compartment (circulation) while viral infection occurred in the apical ciliated cells (airways), simulating the events in infants. In our model, palivizumab effectively prevented RSV infection in a concentration dependent manner.

Although incapable of lysogeny, these viruses demonstrate long-term persistence in the human gut microbiome, dominating the virome in some individuals. RESULTS: Here we show that rapid phase variation of alternate capsular polysaccharides in Bacteroides intestinalis cultures plays an important role in a dynamic equilibrium between phage sensitivity and resistance, allowing phage and bacteria to multiply in parallel. The data also suggests the role of a concomitant phage persistence mechanism associated with delayed lysis of infected cells, similar to carrier state infection. From an ecological and evolutionary standpoint, this type of phage-host interaction is consistent with the Piggyback-the-Winner model, which suggests a preference towards lysogenic or other ""benign"" forms of phage infection when the host is stably present at high abundance. CONCLUSION: Long-term persistence of bacteriophage and host could result from mutually beneficial mechanisms driving bacterial strain-level diversity and phage survival in complex environments.","Shkoporov, Andrey N; Khokhlova, Ekaterina V; Stephens, Niamh; Hueston, Cara; Seymour, Samuel; Hryckowian, Andrew J; Scholz, Dimitri; Ross, R Paul; Hill, Colin",BMC Biol,473,1

Specifically, it measures their perceptions of their current level of adoption of and satisfaction with RVC models, how well this aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario (SCBS), and whether these perceptions influence their view about their own business's mid-term sustainability (SUST). Three groups of small healthcare businesses (i.e., Clinics, Physician Offices, and Pharmacies) are randomly sampled across Colorado. METHODS: We randomly sampled small clinics, physician offices, and pharmacies across Colorado and collected survey data via the assistance of a consulting firm in July 2020. An ordinary least square regression, controlling for demographical characteristics of the business owners, was used for analysis. The focal estimated effects of the study were compared across the three groups of small businesses to draw several insights. RESULTS: The total sample size was 270 respondents, consisting of 82 Clinic, 99 Small Physician Office, and 89 Pharmacy owners across the state of Colorado. The estimation results suggest that the direct effects of SRVC and SCBS on SUST are significant and positive. The goal of the paper, however, is measured via the interaction effect between SRVC and SCBC, which measures whether the adoption of RVC aligns with their perceptions of the current business scenario and whether this interaction impacts their perception of their business's sustainability. We find differing effects across the three groups. The interaction term SRVC × SCBS is significant and positive for the clinics sample (p = 0.02), significant and negative for the physician offices sample (p = 0.05), and not significant for the pharmacy owners' sample. These variations explain that while RVC alignment with the current business scenario is perceived positively by clinics, the opposite is true for small physician offices. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to grow worldwide, and the adoption of remote and virtual care is progressing at a rapid speed, it is critical to understand its impact on small healthcare businesses and their perceptions of long-term survival. This study finds that small physician practices are not able to take advantage of rapid remote and virtual care developments and, in contrast to clinics, feel it to be incompatible with business survival during (and following) the current pandemic. If small healthcare firms are unable to compete with RVC (or synergistically integrate RVC platforms into their current business practices) and eventually go out of business, the damage thus inflicted to traditional healthcare services may be severe, particularly in the area of critical care delivery and other important services that RVC cannot effectively replace. This paper hence has implications for public policy decisions such as incentive-aligned models, policy-initiated incentives, and payer-based strategies for improved alignment between RVC and existing models.","Parthasarathy, Madhavan; Khuntia, Jiban; Stacey, Rulon",J. med. internet res,473,16

MicroRNAs can regulate placental development and contribute to disease, by influencing gene expression. Our previous study revealed an increase in miR-193b-5p expression in placentae from patients with early-onset pregnancy complications and identified candidate gene targets for miR-193b-5p. The purpose of this study is two-fold, first to validate candidate gene targets predicted for miR-193b-5p from microRNA-RNA expression data. Second, to overexpress miR-193b-5p in a trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) to assess impact on trophoblast cell proliferation and migration. Integration of the miRNA and RNA sequencing expression data revealed 10 candidate gene targets for miR-193b-5p across all patient groups (PE only, IUGR only, PE + IUGR). Luciferase experiments identified two gene targets for miR-193b-5p, APLN and FGF13. Real-time PCR confirmed a median 45% decrease of FGF13 expression across 3 patient groups, and 50% decrease of APLN expression in patients with PE + IUGR. Following transfection of HTR-8/SVneo cells with miR-193b-5p mimics, APLN and FGF13 mRNA expression in HTR-8/SVneo was reduced by a median percentage of 30% and 45%, respectively. Concomitantly, HTR-8/SVneo cells demonstrate 40% reduction in cell migration. APLN and FGF13 immunoreactivity was identified strongly in the cytotrophoblast cells of the human placentae. These findings suggest that miR-193b-5p may contribute to trophoblast dysfunction observed in pregnancy complications such as PE and IUGR.","Awamleh, Zain; Han, Victor K M",Mol. Biol. reports,473,24

(Special Issue: COVID-19 pandemic.),18.096071,5.0263767,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The fourth sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, COVID-19, emerged in late 2019, leading to the most devastating pandemic since the Spanish influenza (H1N1) of 1918, which seized 50 million lives worldwide (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html). Elected officials must make critical system-level decisions for stymieing the spread of the virus. Businesspersons must make personnel, financial, and operational decisions to minimize transmission while preserving their business's vitality. Members of the public must make personal decisions about personal protective equipment and changing social, recreational, occupational, and spiritual behavior to protect themselves and others. The scientific community can shift how they illustrate the virus's behavior to the public in an appropriate and understandable way so that the public can make informed decisions. This article suggests the use of a single-case design and logarithmic analyses to improve the current methodologies for COVID-19 analysis and illustration. METHOD: The Standard Celeration Chart was used with Theil's incomplete regression and a 7-point change analysis; the authors demonstrate a suitable virus-tracking and mitigation methodology. RESULTS: Analysis and data visualization are standardized, providing an accurate depiction of the virus's growth for public dissemination and decision-making. An analytic strategy is demonstrated for retrospectively detecting meaningful changes in viral growth or prospectively measuring such changes that coincide with known mitigation strategies. DISCUSSION: The authors suggest improvements in bridging science to application by making COVID-19 informatics more meaningful and actionable by lawmakers, businesspersons, and the public. Limitations and future directions for COVID-19 informatics are discussed.

Employees from Greece (N = 1006) participated from October 1 to November 5, 2020, in an anonymous online factorial survey experiment. Measures of dispositional optimism, faith in intuition, risk-taking propensity, and acquiring resources mindset were included as individual difference variables. Multilevel modeling techniques were used for data analyses. Components of HBM had significant effects on intentions to vaccinate. Two-way interactions between severity and susceptibility beliefs and three-way interaction among perceived severity, susceptibility, and perceived benefits were detected. In line with the events systems theory, a critical event moderated beliefs' effects on intention to vaccinate. Acquiring resources mindset emerged as important individual difference that positively related to intentions. The model explained 59 per cent of the variance in vaccination intentions. The study highlighted interaction effects among the HBM components and how critical events may moderate belief effects.","Zampetakis, Leonidas A; Melas, Christos",Applied psychology.

The use of the da Vinci surgical system entails an additional aspect of noise in the OR. The SOTOS surgical team used wired or wireless headphone/microphone combinations to communicate. We measured sound pressure levels in two different locations in the OR and the heart rate of every surgical team member as an indicator of the stress level. We further captured subjective acceptance of SOTOS as well as perioperative data such as surgical time. We prospectively randomised 32 RALP patients into two study arms. Sixteen surgeries were performed using SOTOS and 16 without (control). Overall, the mean sound pressure level in the SOTOS group was 3.6 dB lower compared to the control (p < 0.001). The highest sound pressure level measured was 96 dB in the control group. Mean heart rates were 81.3 beats/min for surgeons and 90.8 beats/min for circulating nurses.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of IV vitamin C in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study with propensity score matching of intensive care unit (ICU) patients who received 1.5 grams IV vitamin C every 6 hours for up to 4 days for COVID-19 infection. The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included vasopressor requirements in norepinephrine equivalents, ICU length of stay, and change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. RESULTS: Eight patients received IV vitamin C and were matched to 24 patients. Patients in the IV vitamin C group had higher rates of hospital mortality [7 (88%) vs. 19 (79%), P = 0.049]. There was no difference in the daily vasopressor requirement in the treatment group or between the 2 groups. The mean SOFA scores post-treatment was higher in the IV vitamin C group (12.4 ± 2.8 vs. 8.1 ± 3.5, P < 0.005). There was no difference in ICU length of stay between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive IV vitamin C for the management of COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients may not decrease the incidence of mortality, vasopressor requirements, SOFA scores, or ventilator settings.","Li, Matthew; Ching, Tsung Han; Hipple, Christopher; Lopez, Ricardo; Sahibzada, Asad; Rahman, Habibur",J Pharm Pract,473,7

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed, and the relationship between them was analyzed. RESULTS: Totally, 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58 (73%) of the 80 patients had cough, and 61 (76%) of the 80 patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 ± 6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%).

Clinical knowledge was saved for each subject and corresponded with that of SSNHL subjects demonstrating in 2019. RESULT: Between 1 April and 30 September 2020, 68 patients admitted to OC for SSNHL; in 2019, there were 41 subjects, for an incidence rate ratio of 8.5 per 100.000 (95% CI 1.02-2.92) for the 2020 cohort. Of the 2020 group, forty-one patients (60.3%) presented with active or recent symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection, compared with four (9.8%) in 2019 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, subjects in 2020 group were younger (-15.5 years, p = 0.0141) than 2019 group and demonstrated prolonged interim (+1.7 days, p < 0.001) between SSNHL initiation and OC petition. CONCLUSION: We detected increased incidence of SSNHL during the COVID-19 widespread compared to the same interval of the prior year; 60.3% of subjects confronting with SSNHL had signs that were harmonious with COVID-19.","Fidan, Vural; Akin, Okan; Koyuncu, Handan",Am J Otolaryngol,473,22

We assessed the diagnostic performance of CXR in consecutive patients presenting at the emergency room at the Policlinico San Donato, Milan, Italy from February 24 to April 8, 2020 for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results of CXR were classified as positive or negative according to the original prospective radiologic reports. To overcome the limitations of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab, especially oscillating sensitivity, we added the information obtained from phone calls to discharged patients with negative initial RT-PCR. Thus, we included 535 patients with concomitant CXR and RT-PCR on admission (aged 65±17 y; 340 males, 195 females), resulting in 408 RT-PCR positive and 127 negative patients at the composite reference standard. Original CXR reports showed an 89.0% sensitivity (95% confidence intervals [CI], 85.5%-91.8%), 60.6% specificity (95% CI, 51.6%-69.2%), 87.9% positive predictive value (95% CI, 84.4%-90.9%), and 63.1% negative predictive value (95% CI, 53.9%-71.7%). The adoption of CXR alongside RT-PCR to triage patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a safe and efficient workflow, counteracting possible false negative RT-PCR results.","Schiaffino, Simone; Tritella, Stefania; Cozzi, Andrea; Carriero, Serena; Blandi, Lorenzo; Ferraris, Laurenzia; Sardanelli, Francesco",J Thorac Imaging,473,16

The aim of this study is to analyze a) knowledge about, and feelings related to the Corona-pandemic. Describe b) loneliness, depression and anxiety and, c) the perceived, immediate impact of the lockdown on frequency of social contacts and quality of health care provision of people with cognitive impairment during social distancing and lockdown in the primary care system and living at home in Germany. METHODS: This analysis is based on data of a telephone-based assessment in a convenience sample of n = 141 people with known cognitive impairment in the primary care setting. Data on e.g. cognitive and psychological status prior to the pandemic was available. Attitudes, knowledge about and perceived personal impact of the pandemic, social support, loneliness, anxiety, depression, change in the frequency of social activities due to the pandemic and perceived impact of the pandemic on health care related services were assessed during the time of lockdown. RESULTS: The vast majority of participants are sufficiently informed about Corona (85%) and most think that the measures taken are appropriate (64%). A total of 11% shows one main symptom of a depression according to DSM-5. The frequency of depressive symptoms has not increased between the time before pandemic and lockdown in almost all participants. The sample shows minimal (65.0%) or low symptoms of anxiety (25%). The prevalence of loneliness is 10%. On average seven activities have decreased in frequency due to the pandemic. Social activities related to meeting people, dancing or visiting birthdays have decreased significantly. Talking with friends by phone and activities like gardening have increased. Utilization of health care services like day clinics, relief services and prescribed therapies have been reported to have worsened due to the pandemic. Visits to general practitioners decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a small impact of the pandemic on psychological variables like depression, anxiety and loneliness in the short-term in Germany. There is a decrease in social activities as expected. The impact on health care provision is prominent. There is a need for qualitative, in-depth studies to further interpret the results.","Thyrian, Jochen René; Kracht, Friederike; Nikelski, Angela; Boekholt, Melanie; Schumacher-Schönert, Fanny; Rädke, Anika; Michalowsky, Bernhard; Vollmar, Horst Christian; Hoffmann, Wolfgang; Rodriguez, Francisca S; Kreisel, Stefan H",BMC Geriatr,473,3

This type of tumor is difficult to identify and can easily be misdiagnosed. The International PPB protocol is a complicated and aggressive protocol. It is not easily applicable to developing countries where hospitals do not have enough resources. Here we present a challanging case of a patient successfully treated in Vietnam, using limited medical resources. The patient (22 month old, male) was diagnosed with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in his 1st hospital admission. After 6 months of onset, the patient was diagnosed with PPB type II in the fourth hospitalization following analysis of a lung CT scan and a pathology report. After the aggressive chemotherapy regimen, the patient had two episodes of severe neutropenia and infection from which he recovered. The patient received chemotherapy and surgery treatment at our hospital, but received radiation under general anesthesia and rehabilitation therapy to improve respiration at another hospital over 600 km away. It has been 1.5 years after entering remission, and he is starting kindergarten. Lung CT scan and pathology should be analyzed to avoid missing diagnosis of PPB in patients with cystic or mixed cystic and solid lung lesions. Biopsies from cases of suspected PPB should be sent for expert pathology review. Two factors important to the successful application of the protocol are good supportive care and the multidisciplinary collaboration between medical facilities to provide proper resources during treatment. We hope to recreate more successful outcomes not only in Vietnam but also in all developing countries.","Lan, Bui Ngoc; Ngoc, Le Thi Kim; Thach, Hoang Ngoc; Duy, Phan Canh",Pediatr Hematol Oncol,473,3

It is critical to find new treatments. Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.","Shen, Chenguang; Wang, Zhaoqin; Zhao, Fang; Yang, Yang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Delin; Yang, Minghui; Xing, Li; Wei, Jinli; Xiao, Haixia; Yang, Yan; Qu, Jiuxin; Qing, Ling; Chen, Li; Xu, Zhixiang; Peng, Ling; Li, Yanjie; Zheng, Haixia; Chen, Feng; Huang, Kun; Jiang, Yujing; Liu, Dongjing; Zhang, Zheng; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei",JAMA,473,22

However, as demonstrated during the global pandemic (COVID-19), face-to-face interviewing is not always viable. This lack of availability has been particularly relevant for people with disability who are at increased risk of contracting the virus and experiencing poorer outcomes. Fortunately, advancing technologies provide increasing opportunities for communicating online, thus it is plausible for qualitative disability researchers to adapt to remote interviewing. People with ABI often experience varying degrees of cognitive and communication impairments and therefore require specific considerations in the planning of research projects. In this paper, we examine learnings from existing literature around online qualitative research, specifically for videoconference, focus groups and email-interviewing methods. The key aim is to map out the practical, ethical and methodological considerations when adapting research to an online environment. As interviewing people with ABI online has received little attention in the literature, learnings from broader disability populations and the general population inform much of the considerations. Thus, the suggestions for practice are likely to be relevant to a broader population, but specific implications for people with ABI are discussed. Overall, we propose that it is viable, and sometimes preferable, to utilize online interview techniques but researchers must take care to consider the practical, ethical and methodological implications of doing so.

Connectivity matrices derived from MNOs at EU scale can help the understanding of the initial dynamics of the spread. This work is expected to provide input to epidemiological modelling in informing policies on de-escalation of control measures and recovery. Connectivity data between administrative areas can also be used to estimate impacts and spread of future outbreaks. A case study of France shows that mobility alone can explain from 52% up to 92% of the initial spread of the virus, while there is no effect before the outbreak, and has a slow decay effect after lockdown measures are effective. It also emerges that internal mobility is more important than mobility across geographical departments.","Iacus, Stefano Maria; Santamaria, Carlos; Sermi, Francesco; Spyratos, Spyridon; Tarchi, Dario; Vespe, Michele",,473,16

The disease rapidly expanded and led to an epidemic throughout China, followed by the rising number of cases worldwide. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are immediately needed to identify, isolate and treat the patients as soon as possible, decreasing mortality rates and the risk of public contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in two hospitals in Alborz Province in Iran. All recruited cases in this study were symptomatic adults hospitalized as COVID-19 patients with compatible Computed tomographic (CT) scan findings and available rRT-PCR results. The patients were recruited in this study. The patients were categorized into positive and negative rRT-PCR groups and evaluated for symptoms, initial vital signs, comorbidity, clinical and laboratory findings. Finally, the results were assessed by SPSS software. RESULTS: Between March 5 to April 5, 2020, 164 symptomatic COVID-19 patients were studied. In total, there were 111 rRT-PCR positive (67.6%) and 53 rRT-PCR negative patients (32.4%).

Specifically, it has shown a predilection towards obese patients as well as well as other vulnerable groups including predilection of males over females, old age over young age and black races over Caucasian ones. Single cell sequencing studies have highlighted the role of cell polarity and the co-expression of proteases, such as Furin, along with ACE2 in the genesis of coronavirus disease rather than exclusively link tissue involvement with ACE2 levels thought previously. It has also forged a connection between the genetic and immune cellular mechanisms underlying COVID infection and the inflammatory state of obese patients, offering a more accurate explanation as to why obese patients are at increased risk of poor COVID outcomes. These commonalities encompass macrophage phenotype switching, genetic expression switching, and overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, depletion of the regulatory cytokines, in situ T cell proliferation, and T cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of single cell sequencing as a rapid means to identify and treat those who are most likely to need hospital admission and intensive care, in the hopes of precision medicine. Furthermore, this study underlines the use of immune modulators such as Leptin sensitizers, rather than immune suppressors as anti-inflammation therapies to switch the inflammatory response from a drastic immunological type 1 response to a beneficial type 2 effective one.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Fouda, Raghda; Kamel, Aya; Mishriky, Fady; Ismail, Habiba-Allah; El Qadi, Layla; Malak, Lauris; Mohamed, Maram; Arsanyous, Mariem; Hazem, Maysa; El-Husseiny, Miral; Ashraf, Mirette; Hafez, Nada; AlShehry, Nada; El-Husseiny, Nadine; AbdelRaouf, Nora; Shebl, Noura; Hafez, Nouran; Youssef, Nourhan; Afdal, Peter; Hozaien, Rafeef; Menshawey, Rahma; Saeed, Rana; Yasser, Reem; Hesham, Shereen; Zakarriah, Wesam; Khattab, Shahenda; Elammary, Yasmine; Ye, Jianping",Obes Med,473,22

DESIGN: An interpretive descriptive study design was employed, and data were collected using semi‐structured interviews conducted via telephone or videoconference. Purposive recruitment targeted clinical managers responsible for the COVID‐19 response in RACFs. METHODS: RACF clinical managers were invited to discuss their responses to COVID‐19 including the management of RACF and staff. Semi‐structured interviews explored the COVID‐19‐related challenges, the response to these challenges and how telehealth might assist in overcoming some of these challenges. This study followed Thorne's (2008) three‐stage process of interpretive description. The COREQ checklist was used in preparing this manuscript. RESULTS: Two main themes were identified. The first theme ‘keeping people safe’ was comprised of three subthemes; fear and uncertainty, managing the risks and retaining and recruiting staff. The second theme was ‘keeping people connected’, had two subthemes; being disconnected and isolated and embracing technology. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study provide valuable insight into understanding the context and the challenges for RACFs and the staff as they attempt to keep residents safe and connected with healthcare providers and the outside world. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding the experiences of RACF managers in preparing to respond to the pandemic will better inform practice development in aged care in particular the use of telehealth and safe practices during COVID‐19. Increased awareness of the challenges faced by RACFs during a pandemic provides policymakers with valuable insights for future planning of pandemic responses.","Sunner, Carla; Giles, Michelle; Parker, Vicki; Kable, Ashley; Foureur, Maralyn",J Clin Nurs,473,6

Hence, this study explores the relationship between coping strategies used by healthcare and emergency workers in Italy to manage the stress factors related to the COVID-19 emergency, which may result in the risk of developing secondary trauma. We study differences between healthcare (n = 121) and emergency workers (n = 89) in terms of their coping strategies, emergency stress, and secondary trauma, as well as the relationships of these differences to demographic variables and other stress factors (Instructions and Equipment). For this purpose, we collected data from participants through the following questionnaires online: Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale – Italian Version, The Coping Self-Efficacy Scale – Short Form, an original questionnaire on stressors, and the Emergency Stress Questionnaire (to assess organizational–relational, physical, decisional inefficacy, emotional, cognitive, and COVID-19 stress). We performed a t-test, correlational analysis, and hierarchical regression. The analyses reveal that compared with the emergency worker group, the health worker group has greater levels of emergency stress and arousal and is more willing to use problem-focused coping. Healthcare workers involved in the treatment of COVID-19 are exposed to a large degree of stress and could experience secondary trauma; hence, it is essential to plan prevention strategies for future pandemic situations. Moreover, individual efficacy in stopping negative emotions and thoughts could be a protective strategy against stress and secondary trauma.","Vagni, Monia; Maiorano, Tiziana; Giostra, Valeria; Pajardi, Daniela",Front Psychol,473,23

Pigs with PMWS are often infected with a variety of other pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and mycoplasm, in addition to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). PCV2 and Haemophilus parasuis serovar 4 (HPS4) coinfection remain epidemic in China. METHODS: Here we report construction of a three-week-old naturally farrowed, colostrum-deprived (NFCD) piglet’s infection model and demonstrate that PCV2-infected piglets with the HPS4 coinfection increased the virulence of PCV2 and these pathogens interact acquired PMWS. RESULTS: All the single infected piglets were transiently bacteremic or viremic. All the PCV2/HPS4 coinfected piglets developed PMWS, characterized by dyspnea, anorexia, prostration and lose weight severely. Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 resulted in an increased amount of virus in serum and tissues, presented a slower generation and lower levels of antibodies against PCV2. Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 resulted in further reductions in total and differential peripheral blood leukocyte counts. Meantime, PCV2/ HPS4 coinfection potentiated the severity of lung and lymphoid lesions by PCV2-associated, increased the virulence of PCV2-antigen and enhanced the incidence of PMWS in piglets. CONCLUSION: Co-infection with PCV2 and HPS4 induce the exacerbation of system injuries and enhance the pathogenicity of PCV2 in piglets.","Liu, Shuqing; Li, Wentao; Wang, Yang; Gu, Changqin; Liu, Xiaoli; Charreyre, Catherine; Fan, Shenxian; He, Qigai",Virol J,473,1

Theoretical concepts emerging from the dramaturgical perspective of Erving Goffman (1959) and from contemporary symbolic interactionists illuminate how sugar consumption is simultaneously shunned and celebrated in private family life. Moving beyond previous research, we track the ways sugary products facilitate love, sanity, and privacy to make daily family life bearable for both parents and children.

Through different inoculation routes, MHV-A59 can provide animal models for encephalitis, hepatitis and pneumonia to explore viral life machinery and virus-host interactions. In viral replication, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5), also termed main protease (Mpro), plays a dominant role in processing coronavirus-encoded polyproteins and is thus recognized as an ideal target of anti-coronavirus agents. However, no structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro has been reported, and molecular exploration of the catalysis mechanism remains hindered. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro complexed with a Michael acceptor-based inhibitor, N3. Structural analysis revealed that the Cβ of the vinyl group of N3 covalently bound to C145 of the catalytic dyad of Mpro, which irreversibly inactivated cysteine protease activity. The lactam ring of the P1 side chain and the isobutyl group of the P2 side chain, which mimic the conserved residues at the same positions of the substrate, fit well into the S1 and S2 pockets. Through a comparative study with Mpro of other coronaviruses, we observed that the substrate-recognition pocket and enzyme inhibitory mechanism is highly conservative. Altogether, our study provided structural features of MHV-A59 Mpro and indicated that a Michael acceptor inhibitor is an ideal scaffold for antiviral drugs.","Cui, Wen; Cui, Shanshan; Chen, Cheng; Chen, Xia; Wang, Zefang; Yang, Haitao; Zhang, Lei",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,473,16

These three findings when combined should alert physicians to the potential presence of Cushing’s syndrome (CS). On admission, a quick diagnosis of CS was made based on clinical and biochemical features and the patient was treated urgently using high dose oral metyrapone thus allowing delays in surgery and rapidly improving the patient’s clinical condition. This resulted in the treatment of hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia and hypertension reducing cardiovascular risk and likely risk for infection. Observing COVID-19 pandemic international guidelines to treat patients with CS has shown to be effective and offers endocrinologists an option to manage these patients adequately in difficult times. LEARNING POINTS: This case report highlights the importance of having a low threshold for suspicion and investigation for Cushing’s syndrome in a patient with neutrophilia and hypokalaemia, recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes especially in someone with catabolic features of the disease irrespective of losing weight. It also supports the use of alternative methods of approaching the diagnosis and treatment of Cushing’s syndrome during a pandemic as indicated by international protocols designed specifically for managing this condition during Covid-19.","Faisal, Ziadoon; Debono, Miguel",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep,473,17

Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases. Methods We retrospectively studied the relationship between RDW and COVID19 mortality risk for 1198 adult patients diagnosed with SARS COV2 at 4 Partners Healthcare Network Hospitals between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Findings Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with increased mortality in patients of all ages with a risk ratio of 2.5 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8). Stratified by age, the risk ratio was 6.2 (4.4-7.9, N = 312) < 50 years, 3.2 (2.5-4.1, N = 230) 50-60, 2.3 (1.6-3.1, N = 236) 60-70, 1.2 (0.7-1.8, N = 203) 70-80, and 1.9 (1.5-2.3, N = 216) > 80 years. RDW was significantly associated with mortality in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-Dimer, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities (p < 1e-4 for RDW in all cases). Patients whose RDW increased during admission had a ~3-fold elevation in mortality risk compared to those whose RDW did not change. Interpretation Elevated RDW at diagnosis and an increase in RDW during admission are both associated with increased mortality risk for adult COVID19 patients at a large academic medical center network.","Foy, B.

A number of mechanisms involved in regeneration, such as proliferation and tissue remodeling, affect whole tissues; however, little is known on how distinctively different constituent cell types respond to the dynamics of regenerating tissues. Preliminary studies suggest that a number of organisms alter neuronal numbers to scale with changes in body size. In some species with the ability of whole-body axis regeneration, it has additionally been observed that regenerates are smaller than their pre-amputated parent, but maintain the correct morphological proportionality, suggesting that scaling of tissue and neuronal numbers also occurs. However, the cell dynamics and responses of neuronal subtypes during nervous system regeneration, scaling, and whole-body axis regeneration are not well understood in any system. The cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is capable of whole-body axis regeneration, with a number of observations suggesting the ability to alter its size in response to changes in feeding. We took advantage of Nematostella’s transparent and “simple” body plan and the NvLWamide-like mCherry fluorescent reporter transgenic line to probe the response of neuron populations to variations in body size in vivo in adult animals during body scaling and regeneration. RESULTS: We utilized the previously characterized NvLWamide-like::mCherry transgenic reporter line to determine the in vivo response of neuronal subtypes during growth, degrowth, and regeneration. Nematostella alters its size in response to caloric intake, and the nervous system responds by altering neuronal number to scale as the animal changes in size. Neuronal numbers in both the endodermal and ectodermal nerve nets decreased as animals shrunk, increased as they grew, and these changes were reversible. Whole-body axis regeneration resulted in regenerates that were smaller than their pre-amputated size, and the regenerated nerve nets were reduced in neuronal number. Different neuronal subtypes had distinct responses during regeneration, including consistent, not consistent, and conditional increases in number. Conditional responses were regulated, in part, by the size of the remnant fragment and the position of the amputation site. Regenerates and adults with reduced nerve nets displayed normal behaviors, indicating that the nerve net retains functionality as it scales. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the Nematostella nerve net is dynamic, capable of scaling with changes in body size, and that neuronal subtypes display differential regenerative responses, which we propose may be linked to the scale state of the regenerating animals.

A team of resident doctors in public health from the University of Padua and specialists in risk analysis in public health examined the mass vaccination process. A diagram was drafted to illustrate the various phases of mass vaccination, analyze the process, and identify all failure modes. Criticalities were ascertained by rating the severity, frequency and likelihood of failure detection on a scale of 1 to 10. We identified a total of 71 possible faults distributed over the various phases of the process, and 34 of them were classified as carrying a high risk. For the potentially high-risk failure modes, we identified 63 recommended actions to contain the cause of their occurrence or improve their detection. For the purpose of detecting potential failures, FMECA can be successfully applied to mass vaccination, which should be considered a high-risk process.","Buja, Alessandra; Manfredi, Mariagiovanna; De Luca, Giuseppe; Zampieri, Chiara; Zanovello, Sofia; Perkovic, Davor; Scotton, Francesca; Minnicelli, Anil; De Polo, Anna; Cristofori, Vittorio; Biasi, Laura; Baldovin, Tatjana; Bertoncello, Chiara; Cocchio, Silvia; Baldo, Vincenzo",Vaccines (Basel),473,24

The third session highlighted the need for establishing outcomes research infrastructures to cover primary prevention, early detection, clinical effectiveness of innovations, health‐related quality‐of‐life assessment, survivorship research and health economics. An important outcome of the Summit was the presentation of the Porto Declaration, which called for a collective and committed action throughout Europe to develop the cancer research infrastructures indispensable for fostering innovation and decreasing inequalities within and between member states. Moreover, the Summit guidelines will assist decision making in the context of a unique EU‐wide cancer initiative that, if expertly implemented, will decrease the cancer death toll and improve the quality of life of those confronted with cancer, and this is carried out at an affordable cost.","Ringborg, Ulrik; Berns, Anton; Celis, Julio E.; Heitor, Manuel; Tabernero, Josep; Schüz, Joachim; Baumann, Michael; Henrique, Rui; Aapro, Matti; Basu, Partha; Beets‐Tan, Regina; Besse, Benjamin; Cardoso, Fátima; Carneiro, Fátima; van den Eede, Guy; Eggermont, Alexander; Fröhling, Stefan; Galbraith, Susan; Garralda, Elena; Hanahan, Douglas; Hofmarcher, Thomas; Jönsson, Bengt; Kallioniemi, Olli; Kásler, Miklós; Kondorosi, Eva; Korbel, Jan; Lacombe, Denis; Carlos Machado, José; Martin‐Moreno, José M.; Meunier, Francoise; Nagy, Péter; Nuciforo, Paolo; Oberst, Simon; Oliveiera, Júlio; Papatriantafyllou, Maria; Ricciardi, Walter; Roediger, Alexander; Ryll, Bettina; Schilsky, Richard; Scocca, Grazia; Seruca, Raquel; Soares, Marta; Steindorf, Karen; Valentini, Vincenzo; Voest, Emile; Weiderpass, Elisabete; Wilking, Nils; Wren, Amanda; Zitvogel, Laurence",Mol Oncol,473,1

The spike (S) protein of etiologic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specifically recognizes human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as its receptor, which is recently identified as an interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. Here, we find that hACE2 exists on the surface of exosomes released by different cell types, and the expression of exosomal hACE2 is increased by IFNα/β treatment. In particular, exosomal hACE2 can specifically block the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, subsequently inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and ex vivo. Our findings have indicated that IFN is able to upregulate a viral receptor on the exosomes which competitively block the virus entry, exhibiting a potential antiviral strategy.","Zhang, Junsong; Huang, Feng; Xia, Baijin; Yuan, Yaochang; Yu, Fei; Wang, Guanwen; Chen, Qianyu; Wang, Qian; Li, Yuzhuang; Li, Rong; Song, Zheng; Pan, Ting; Chen, Jingliang; Lu, Gen; Zhang, Hui",Signal Transduct Target Ther,473,16

Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of a SARS survivor infected in 2003. One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.","Pinto, Dora; Park, Young-Jun; Beltramello, Martina; Walls, Alexandra C.; Tortorici, M.

This has forced the scientific community to explore different strategies that allow combating this viral infection as well as treating life-threatening systemic effect of the infection on the individual. In this work, we have reviewed the most recent scientific evidence to provide a comprehensive panorama regarding the biotechnological strategies that have been proposed to combat this new viral infection. We have focused our analysis on vaccine production, nanotechnology applications, repurposing of know drugs for unrelated pathologies, and the search for bioactive molecules obtained from natural products. The goals include safely use as potential prophylactic or therapeutic treatments, based on in silico and in vivo studies, including clinical trials around the world for the correct and timely diagnosis of the infection. This review aims to highlight the development of new ideas that can decrease the time lines for research output and improve research quality while at the same time, keeping in mind the efficacy and safety aspects of these potential biotechnological strategies.","Lobo-Galo, Naun; Gálvez-Ruíz, Juan-Carlos; Balderrama-Carmona, Ana P.; Silva-Beltrán, Norma P.; Ruiz-Bustos, Eduardo",3 Biotech,473,6

SETTING: Selected urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: 106 urban and 106 rural households. OUTCOME VARIABLES AND METHOD: Household food insecurity status and the types of coping strategies were the outcome variables for the analyses. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were done to identify the determinants. RESULTS: We found that around 90% of the households were suffering from different grades of food insecurity. Severe food insecurity was higher in urban (42%) than rural (15%) households. The rural households with mild/moderate food insecurity adopted either financial (27%) or both financial and food compromised (32%) coping strategies, but 61% of urban mild/moderate food insecure households applied both forms of coping strategies. Similarly, nearly 90% of severely food insecure households implemented both types of coping strategies. Living in poorest households was significantly associated (p value <0.05) with mild/moderate (regression coefficient, β: 15.13, 95% CI 14.43 to 15.82), and severe food insecurity (β: 16.28, 95% CI 15.58 to 16.97). The statistically significant (p <0.05) determinants of both food compromised and financial coping strategies were living in urban areas (β: 1.8, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.09), living in poorest (β: 2.7, 95% CI 1 to 4.45), poorer (β: 2.6, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.4) and even in the richer (β: 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9) households and age of the respondent (β: 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21). CONCLUSION: Both urban and rural households suffered from moderate to severe food insecurity during the month-long lockdown period in Bangladesh. But, poorest, poorer and even the richer households adopted different coping strategies that might result in long-term economic and nutritional consequences.","Das, Subhasish; Rasul, Md.

We have analyzed the impact of HBoV in outpatients and in patients requiring hospitalisation or emergency attention for acute respiratory infections. Respiratory viruses were investigated by real-time PCR, direct antigen detection and/or viral culture by shell-vial assay. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, BAL and/or sputum samples from patients attended at a reference hospital, and nasal/throat swabs from outpatients were used. Respiratory viruses were detected in 660 samples (47%). HBoV detection rate was 12.6%, only preceded by respiratory syncytial virus (25%). Co-detections were observed in 12.9% of samples, and HBoV was present in 81% of them. Similar detection rates of HBoV were obtained in individuals with positive and negative results for other respiratory viruses (12.5% and 12.7%, respectively). The crossing point value was taken as a measure of HBoV viral load. Higher HBoV loads were observed in children, and in patients from the hospital. HBoV viral load was not associated with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection or lower respiratory tract disease. Although HBoV is frequently detected in respiratory specimens, there is a poor association between HBoV-positive specimens and clinical parameters. A clinical impact of HBoV in respiratory infection probably occurs in few cases.","Pedrosa-Corral, Irene; Pérez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Navarro-Marí, José-María; Ruiz-Bravo, Alfonso",Indian Journal of Virology,473,26

Conventional PET creates pollution along its entire value chain—during the production, use and end-of-life phases—and also contributes to the unsustainable depletion of resources. The consumption of PET garments thus compromises the quality of land, water and air, destroys ecosystems, and endangers human health. In this article, we discuss the different stages of the value chain for polyester clothing from the perspective of sustainability, describing current environmental challenges such as pollution from textile factory wastewater, and microfibers released from clothing during the laundry cycle.

Arab Americans are a rapidly growing demographic in the United States with limited information on the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy. We therefore sought to study the attitudes towards the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine amongst Arab American health professionals living in the United States. Methods: This was a cross sectional study utilizing an anonymous online survey. The survey was distributed via e-mail to National Arab American Medical Association members and Arab-American Center for Economic and Social Services healthcare employees. Respondents were considered vaccine hesitant if they selected responses other than a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: A total of 4000 surveys were sent via e-mail from 28 December 2020 to 31 January 2021, and 513 responses were received. The highest group of respondents were between the ages of 18–29 years and physicians constituted 48% of the respondents. On multivariable analysis, we found that respondents who had declined an influenza vaccine in the preceding 5 years (p < 0.001) and allied health professionals (medical assistants, hospital administrators, case managers, researchers, scribes, pharmacists, dieticians and social workers) were more likely to be vaccine hesitant (p = 0.025). In addition, respondents earning over $150,000 US dollars annually were less likely to be vaccine hesitant and this finding was significant on multivariable analysis (p = 0.011). Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy among health care providers could have substantial impact on vaccine attitudes of the general population, and such data may help inform vaccine advocacy efforts.","Shallal, Anita; Abada, Evi; Musallam, Rami; Fehmi, Omar; Kaljee, Linda; Fehmi, Ziad; Alzouhayli, Suma; Ujayli, Deema; Dankerlui, Doreen; Kim, Seongho; Cote, Michele L.; Kumar, Vijaya Arun; Zervos, Marcus; Ali-Fehmi, Rouba",Vaccines (Basel),473,1

In many European countries and the US, the burden of Covid-19 epidemic could be much lower if Governments had been able to learn from the China and Lombardy stories and to declare full lockdown without delays. Methods. We use a simple game-theoretic framework for the strategic interaction between the Government, political oppositions and lobbies, combined with a Covid-19 transmission model, to analyse the role of political factors delaying the lockdown declaration, depending on the degrees of ""responsibility"" of political actors. Results. The lockdown can always be declared immediately (i.e., without delay) as sustained transmission arises, only if the government feels fully ""responsible"" towards all citizens. If this is not the case, epidemic growth will eventually dominate the agents' payoffs, so that sooner or later the lockdown will always be declared i.e., both the government and the opposition will be forced by the epidemic to switch towards a higher degree of responsibility, but with a delay. There is a further nontrivial situation where the lockdown can be declared without delay, occurring when the political opposition is at least as responsible as the Government. This however requires the solution of a coordination issue, which cannot be taken for granted. Eventually, a vicious circle emerges, where the delayed lockdown requires a much longer lockdown period to achieve adequate control results, thereby causing the explosion of economic losses and so calling for unlocking long before it should. Conclusions. Lockdown delays have dramatically worsened the impact of the current Covid-19 wave in a number of countries. Citizens should be made cogently aware of this to claim maximal responsibility from political actors and economic lobbies to avoid that such stories repeat in the future when further threats, due to Covid-19 itself or other pathogens, will re-appear.","Carrozzo Magli, A.; d'Onofrio, A.; Manfredi, P.",,473,5

Elective surgeries were suspended for 8 weeks in Kentucky. Our objective was to determine if telehealth (TH) visits could be sustained as an alternative to in-person visits. METHODS: Deidentified data on TH usage, in-person clinic visits, and inpatient and neurosurgical case volumes from March 2, 2020 to June 26, 2020 were obtained for retrospective analysis. RESULTS: TH use increased soon after the case suspension started and then decreased to little usage. The number of in-person visits were significantly lower during elective case suspension compared with when cases were resumed. Twenty-five percent of all visits during the suspension were conducted using TH. Thirty-nine percent of TH-visit patients were new patients, 11% were preoperative, 10% were postoperative, and 39% were other existing patients. Forty-eight percent of TH visits resulted in a later in-person clinic visit. After the suspension, in-person visits rebounded to 98% of the prepandemic numbers and TH visits were low. CONCLUSIONS: TH visits were challenging due to the need for in-person physical examinations in neurosurgery. TH temporarily accommodated patient needs during the pandemic but could not totally replace in-person visits and was not sustained after 3.5 months of use. Video TH visits worked well for nonurgent issues, such as minor visual examinations. Our findings could help guide the implementation of TH should similar circumstances arise again.","Chau, Monica J.; Quintero, Jorge E.; Guiliani, Ashley; Hines, Tripp; Samaan, Christopher; Seybold, Katie; Stowe, Matthew; Hanlon, Dean; Gerhardth, Greg A.; van Horne, Craig",World Neurosurg,473,18

But at the same time, while expressed on the surface of human cells, ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Expression of this receptor has been described in several types of cells, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which raises a concern that the virus may infect and damage the stem cell compartment. We demonstrate for the first time that ACE2 and the entry-facilitating transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 are expressed on very small CD133(+)CD34(+)Lin(−)CD45(−) cells in human umbilical cord blood (UCB), which can be specified into functional HSCs and EPCs. The existence of these cells known as very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) has been confirmed by several laboratories, and some of them may correspond to putative postnatal hemangioblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that, in human VSELs and HSCs, the interaction of the ACE2 receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activates the Nlrp3 inflammasome, which if hyperactivated may lead to cell death by pyroptosis. Based on this finding, there is a possibility that human VSELs residing in adult tissues could be damaged by SARS-CoV-2, with remote effects on tissue/organ regeneration. We also report that ACE2 is expressed on the surface of murine bone marrow-derived VSELs and HSCs, although it is known that murine cells are not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, human and murine VSELs express several RAAS genes, which sheds new light on the role of these genes in the specification of early-development stem cells.

Nurses are integral members of the primary health care team and have an important role in managing obesity and administering physical activity (PA) for patients. However, research shows that nurses tend to be overweight or obese, have poor metabolic health, and do not meet PA recommendations. This is problematic because PA is linked to both physiological and psychological well-being and may also influence how nurses counsel their patients. Nursing students are the next generation of nurses; however, there is limited research examining PA (among other lifestyle factors) and metabolic health in nursing students. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to examine multiple lifestyle factors (including PA, nutrition, sleep, and stress) and determine whether these factors are associated with metabolic health in full-time undergraduate nursing students. METHODS: An estimated 320 nursing students (18 years of age and older) will be assessed for their metabolic health. Metabolic status will be determined by measuring body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage [skinfold measures (FitSystems Inc)], resting blood pressure [automated oscillatory (Omron Healthcare Inc)], and fasting blood glucose (glucometer). Lifestyle factors will also be measured, including PA and sleep [the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day accelerometry (wGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC)], nutrition [3-day diet log (Nutritionist Pro, Axxya Systems)], and stress [the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, heart rate variability assessments, and salivary cortisol (ELISA, Eagle Biosciences)]. The association between metabolic status and PA, sleep quantity and quality, nutrition, and stress will be examined by linear regression analyses. Differences by year of study in metabolic health status, PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress will be examined by 1-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). To determine the ability of PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress to discriminate prevalent overweight and obesity or poor metabolic status, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed. Statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC). RESULTS: Based on pilot data, we believe senior nursing students will have worse metabolic health (ie, higher BMI and WHR, increased body fat percentage, higher blood pressure, and increased fasting blood glucose) compared to first-year students. We hypothesize that poor PA participation, poor sleep quantity and quality, increased food intake, poor nutrition, and increased stress will be associated with worse metabolic health in full-time nursing students. The study received funding in February 2020. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, work on this study has been delayed. We are currently completing our application for institutional research ethics approval. Data collection is projected to begin in January 2021, with data collection and analyses expected to be completed by May 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will be the first published research to examine the relationship between lifestyle choices and metabolic status in nursing students attending a Canadian institution. More importantly, the results of this study will support the development of an informed intervention that will target the identified lifestyle factors, improving the physiological and mental health and well-being of nursing students.

This approach has been successful for isolating cognitive processes, but cannot adequately capture how perception operates in complex environments. In turn, real-world environments rarely afford the access and control required for rigorous scientific experimentation. In recent years, technology has advanced to provide a solution to these problems, through the development of affordable high-capability virtual reality (VR) equipment. The application of VR is now increasing rapidly in psychology, but the realism of its avatars, and the extent to which they visually represent real people, is captured poorly in current VR experiments. Here, we demonstrate a user-friendly method for creating photo-realistic avatars of real people and provide a series of studies to demonstrate their psychological characteristics. We show that avatar faces of familiar people are recognised with high accuracy (Study 1), replicate the familiarity advantage typically observed in real-world face matching (Study 2), and show that these avatars produce a similarity-space that corresponds closely with real photographs of the same faces (Study 3). These studies open the way to conducting psychological experiments on visual perception and social cognition with increased realism in VR.","Fysh, Matthew C.; Trifonova, Iliyana V.; Allen, John; McCall, Cade; Burton, A.

Therefore, new antiviral drug candidates are urgently needed. The promising new antiviral drug candidate silvestrol effectively inhibited replication of Corona‐, Ebola‐, Zika‐, Picorna‐, Hepatis E and Chikungunya viruses. Besides a direct impact on pathogens, modulation of the host immune system provides an additional facet to antiviral drug development because suitable immune modulation can boost innate defence mechanisms against the pathogens. In the present study, silvestrol down‐regulated several pro‐ and anti‐inflammatory cytokines (IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10, CCL2, CCL18) and increased TNF‐α during differentiation and activation of M1‐macrophages, suggesting that the effects of silvestrol might cancel each other out. However, silvestrol amplified the anti‐inflammatory potential of M2‐macrophages by increasing expression of anti‐inflammatory surface markers CD206, TREM2 and reducing release of pro‐inflammatory IL‐8 and CCL2. The differentiation of dendritic cells in the presence of silvestrol is characterized by down‐regulation of several surface markers and cytokines indicating that differentiation is impaired by silvestrol. In conclusion, silvestrol influences the inflammatory status of immune cells depending on the cell type and activation status.","Blum, Leonard; Geisslinger, Gerd; Parnham, Michael J.; Grünweller, Arnold; Schiffmann, Susanne",J Cell Mol Med,473,20

Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR; i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed.","Taylor, Steven; Asmundson, Gordon J. G.",PLoS One,473,27

A strong understanding of the infection pathway of SARS-CoV-2, and how our immune system responds to the virus is highly pertinent for guiding the development and improvement of effective treatments. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) and their implications in clinical practice. The aspects include the pathophysiology of the immune response, particularly humoral adaptive immunity and the roles of NAbs from B cells in infection clearance. We summarise the onset and persistence of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, and we explore their roles in neutralising SARS-CoV-2, their persistence in convalescent individuals, and in reinfection. Furthermore, we also review the applications of neutralising antibodies in the clinical setting—from predictors of disease severity to serological testing to vaccinations, and finally in therapeutics such as convalescent plasma infusion.","Pang, Natalie Yan-Lin; Pang, Alexander Shao-Rong; Chow, Vincent T.; Wang, De-Yun",Mil Med Res,473,11

Remodelling of native VSMC to a proliferative state for vascular development, adaptation or repair is driven by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). A key effector downstream of PDGF receptors is store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) mediated through the plasma membrane calcium ion channel, ORAI1, which is activated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium store sensor, stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1). This SOCE was shown to play fundamental roles in the pathological remodelling of VSMC. Exciting transgenic lineage-tracing studies have revealed that the contribution of the phenotypically-modulated VSMC in atherosclerotic plaque formation is more significant than previously appreciated, and growing evidence supports the relevance of ORAI1 signalling in this pathologic remodelling. ORAI1 has also emerged as an attractive potential therapeutic target as it is accessible to extracellular compound inhibition. This is further supported by the progression of several ORAI1 inhibitors into clinical trials. Here we discuss the current knowledge of ORAI1-mediated signalling in pathologic vascular remodelling, particularly in the settings of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neointimal hyperplasia, and the recent developments in our understanding of the mechanisms by which ORAI1 coordinates VSMC phenotypic remodelling, through the activation of key transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT). In addition, we discuss advances in therapeutic strategies aimed at the ORAI1 target.","Shawer, Heba; Norman, Katherine; Cheng, Chew W.; Foster, Richard; Beech, David J.; Bailey, Marc A.",Front Cell Dev Biol,473,24

Hence, it has emerged as an attractive antiviral drug-target. In this study, computational approaches were employed, mainly the structure-based virtual screening coupled with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to computationally identify specific inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PL(pro), that can be further developed as potential pan-PL(pro) based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. The sequence, structure, and functional conserveness of most deadly human CoVs PL(pro) were exploited, and it was revealed that functionally important catalytic triad residues are well conserved among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The subsequent screening of a focused protease inhibitors database composed of ∼7000 compounds resulted in the identification of three candidate compounds, ADM_13083841, LMG_15521745, and SYN_15517940. These three compounds established conserved interactions which were further explored through MD simulations, free energy calculations, and residual energy contribution estimated by MM-PB(GB)SA method. All these compounds showed stable conformation and interacted well with the active residues of SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) and showed consistent interaction profile with SARS-CoV PL(pro) and MERS-CoV PL(pro) as well. Conclusively, the reported SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) specific compounds could serve as seeds for developing potent pan-PL(pro) based broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against deadly human coronaviruses. Moreover, the presented information related to binding site residual energy contribution could lead to further optimization of these compounds.","Alamri, Mubarak A.; Tahir ul Qamar, Muhammad; Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Alqahtani, Safar M.; Froeyen, Matheus; Chen, Ling-Ling",J Pharm Anal,473,1

Increase in body weights and food consumption were compared to animals fed a cereal-based control diet. Animals were sacrificed at various intervals and tissues were taken for histopathological observation. By 8 weeks moderate to marked periportal lipidosis developed in livers of all rats fed the AIN-76A diet. Liver-body weight ratios over the 8-week period were significantly higher in rats fed AIN-76A diets compared to rats fed the control diet. However, growth rates of rats fed the AIN-76A diet were similar to growth rates of controls. Some rats fed the AIN-76A diet developed severe hemorrhagic lesions.

METHODS: Participants were 181 adolescents (M(age) = 15.23 years; 51% female; 47% Latinx) and their parents. Frequency of parent-adolescent conversations about COVID-19 (i.e., pandemic-related symptoms, health behaviors, and social effects), empathic concern toward vulnerable others, and adolescent HPBs were assessed via surveys in the first months of the pandemic, and empathic concern and HPBs were assessed again nine months later. RESULTS: Results revealed that more frequent parent-adolescent conversations early in the pandemic predicted increased adherence to HPBs throughout the pandemic when adolescents reported low stress (direct effect), but conversation frequency predicted decreased adherence to HPBs via reduced empathic concern when adolescents reported high stress (indirect effect). CONCLUSIONS: Parents and other socialization agents, such as teachers, should be sensitive to adolescents’ stress prior to engaging them in frequent conversations about the pandemic to mitigate the potential negative impact these conversations may have on adolescents’ empathic concern and adherence to HPBs. Decreasing adolescents’ stress may be an initial step in promoting effective message transference. Collective action (including wearing masks and receiving the vaccination) remains critical to overcome COVID-19. The current contribution to understanding processes underlying adolescents’ adherence to recommended HPBs is critical pandemic fatigue and stress continue to rise.","Peplak, Joanna; Klemfuss, J.

Twenty unvaccinated pregnant sows were equally allocated to probiotic‐supplemented (P) and control (C) groups. For the experiment, 15 g/day of probiotic compound BIO‐THREE PZ was given to P sows. Reproductive performance was checked daily. The number of neonates fostered by each sow was maintained at eight throughout the experiment. Individual milk production post‐parturition was measured twice. Milk protein and fat ratios were determined by a milk analyzer. Total immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G concentrations were measured by ELISA. At day 7 post‐parturition, the body weight of P sows was 10 kg higher than that of C sows, and at day 3 post‐parturition, P sows produced more milk (+2 kg) and had a higher IgA concentration in whey than did C sows (p < .05). Finally, unlike C sows, P sows tended to return to estrus faster, and had larger piglets at birth with a lower mortality percentage during early days of suckling. In conclusion, probiotic compound BIO‐THREE PZ helped strengthen the immune system of unvaccinated, PED‐infected sows and improved their reproductive performance.","Tsukahara, Takamitsu; Inatomi, Takio; Otomaru, Konosuke; Amatatsu, Masaaki; Romero‐Pérez, Gustavo A.; Inoue, Ryo",Anim Sci J,473,5

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the comparative prevalence of anxiety and depression, and their contributing factors, between nurses working in intensive care units (ICU) with COVID-19 patients (COVID ICU) and nurses working in ICU with patients admitted for other reasons (non-COVID ICU). DESIGN: Quantitative comparative cross-sectional study. METHODS: All frontline nurses working in COVID and non-COVID ICUs at a tertiary care university hospital in Nepal were included. The data were collected using Google Forms. The groups were evaluated and compared in terms of various relevant variables with self-designed socio-demographic questionnaire, the validated Nepali version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12). RESULTS: The response rate was 100%. Of the 99 nurses who met the inclusion criteria, three were excluded. Out of the 96 nurses included, psychiatric caseness was present in 82 (85.4%). There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of psychiatric caseness, anxiety, and depression between the COVID ICU and non-COVID ICU nurses (caseness of 90.4% vs 79.5%, P = .134; anxiety of 36.5% vs 27.3%, P = .587; and depression of 21.2% vs 9.1%, P = .214, respectively). Among the factors that could potentially lead to psychiatric caseness, anxiety, and depression, statistically significant differences were observed only in relation to sleep disturbances, confidence in caring for patients with COVID-19 and intentions to discontinue current job, all being significantly higher in COVID ICU nurses. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression are common in nurses working in both the COVID and non-COVID ICUs, although the difference is not statistically significant. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Early assessment of anxiety and depression in nurses working in all ICUs and their active medical and behavioural interventions are important in protecting this vital work force dealing with the pandemic.","Tamrakar, Parishma; Pant, Sagun Ballav; Acharya, Subhash Prasad",Nurs. crit. care,473,14

Cases are clustered in the city, with certain neighborhoods experiencing more cases than others. We investigate whether potential socioeconomic factors can explain between-neighborhood variation in the number of detected COVID-19 cases. Methods: Data were collected from 177 Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in New York City (99.9% of the population). We fit multiple Bayesian Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) mixed models using positive COVID-19 tests as the outcome and a set of 10 representative economic, demographic, and health-care associated ZCTA-level parameters as potential predictors. The BYM model includes both spatial and nonspatial random effects to account for clustering and overdispersion. Results: Multiple different regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and dependent (under 18 or 65+ years old) population, male to female ratio, and median household income. In the final model, we found that an increase of only 1% in dependent population is associated with a 2.5% increase in detected COVID-19 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6% to 3.4%, p < 0.0005). An increase of 1 male per 100 females is associated with a 1.0% (95% CI: 0.6% to 1.5%, p < 0.0005) increases in detected cases. A decrease of $10,000 median household income is associated with a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.0% to 4.1% p = 0.002) increase in detected COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our findings indicate associations between neighborhoods with a large dependent population, those with a high proportion of males, and low-income neighborhoods and detected COVID-19 cases. Given the elevated mortality in aging populations, the study highlights the importance of public health management during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms by which these factors may have affected the number of detected cases, either in terms of the true number of cases or access to testing.","Whittle, Richard Stuart; Diaz-Artiles, Ana",,473,9

In each case, coronavirus emergence in our species has been associated with zoonotic transmissions from animal reservoirs(1,2), underscoring how prone such pathogens are to spill over and adapt to new species. Among the four recognized genera of the family Coronaviridae – Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, – human infections reported to date have been limited to alpha- and betacoronaviruses(3). We identify, for the first time, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strains in plasma samples of three Haitian children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Genomic and evolutionary analyses reveal that human infections were the result of at least two independent zoonoses of distinct viral lineages that acquired the same mutational signature in the nsp15 and the spike glycoprotein genes by convergent evolution. In particular, structural analysis predicts that one of the changes in the Spike S1 subunit, which contains the receptor-binding domain, may affect protein’s flexibility and binding to the host cell receptor. Our findings not only underscore the ability of deltacoronaviruses to adapt and potentially lead to human-to-human transmission, but also raise questions about the role of such transmissions in development of pre-existing immunity to other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Lednicky, John A.; Tagliamonte, Massimiliano S.; White, Sarah K.; Elbadry, Maha A.; Alam, Md.

Symptoms range from mild to severe and include both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The virus is mainly present in camel populations with occasional zoonotic spill over into humans. The severity of infection in humans is influenced by numerous factors, and similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underlying health complications can play a major role. Currently, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are coincident in the Middle East and thus a rapid way of sequencing MERS-CoV to derive genotype information for molecular epidemiology is needed. Additionally, complicating factors in MERS-CoV infections are coinfections that require clinical management. The ability to rapidly characterize these infections would be advantageous. To rapidly sequence MERS-CoV, an amplicon-based approach was developed and coupled to Oxford Nanopore long read length sequencing. This and a metagenomic approach were evaluated with clinical samples from patients with MERS. The data illustrated that whole-genome or near-whole-genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained. This approach provided data on both consensus genomes and the presence of minor variants, including deletion mutants. The metagenomic analysis provided information of the background microbiome. The advantage of this approach is that insertions and deletions can be identified, which are the major drivers of genotype change in coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in late 2012 in Saudi Arabia. The virus is a serious threat to people not only in the Middle East but also in the world and has been detected in over 27 countries. MERS-CoV is spreading in the Middle East and neighboring countries, and approximately 35% of reported patients with this virus have died. This is the most severe coronavirus infection so far described. Saudi Arabia is a destination for many millions of people in the world who visit for religious purposes (Umrah and Hajj), and so it is a very vulnerable area, which imposes unique challenges for effective control of this epidemic. The significance of our study is that clinical samples from patients with MERS were used for rapid in-depth sequencing and metagenomic analysis using long read length sequencing.","Aljabr, Waleed; Alruwaili, Muhannad; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Alrezaihi, Abdulrahman; Harrison, Abbie Jasmine; Ryan, Yan; Bentley, Eleanor; Jones, Benjamin; Alhatlani, Bader Y.; AlShahrani, Dayel; Mahmood, Zana; Rickett, Natasha Y.; Alosaimi, Bandar; Naeem, Asif; Alamri, Saad; Alsran, Hadel; Hamed, Maaweya E.; Dong, Xiaofeng; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Alrasheed, Abdullah R.; Hamza, Muaawia; Carroll, Miles W.; Gemmell, Matthew; Darby, Alistair; Donovan-Banfield, I’ah; Stewart, James P.; Matthews, David A.; Davidson, Andrew D.; Hiscox, Julian A.",mSphere,473,33

Our aim was to assess the impact of ultrasound-guided TPLA regarding urodynamic improvement and sexual function, monitoring clinical data, postprocedural complications and imaging findings at 3-T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Forty-four patients aged ≥ 50 affected with moderate to severe LUTS (International Prostate Symptoms score ≥ 12) due to benign prostatic obstruction and refractoriness, intolerance or poor compliance to medical therapies underwent US-guided TPLA between May 2018 and February 2020. Clinical measurements included PSA, uroflowmetry, sexual function assessment (using the International Index of Erectile Function and Male Sexual Health Questionnaire-Ejaculatory Dysfunction short form) and quality of life questionnaire. Adverse events were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo scale. Volume changes were measured by MRI and automatic segmentation software during 1-year follow-up. Registration: NCT04044573 – May 5th, 2018, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov RESULTS: MRI assessed the changes over time with a 53% mean reduction of adenoma volume and 71% of the ablated area, associated with clinical and functional improvement and resolution of LUTS in all cases. Five of 44 patients (11.3%) had urinary blockage due to clots and required re-catheterisation for 2 weeks. The overall adverse event rate was 7%. CONCLUSION: US-guided TPLA performed as a safe, manageable and effective treatment for LUTS. It could be considered an alternative effective mini-invasive procedure to standard treatments for BPH in the outpatient setting.","Manenti, Guglielmo; Perretta, Tommaso; Calcagni, Antonello; Ferrari, Donatella; Ryan, Colleen P.; Fraioli, Federico; Meucci, Rosaria; Malizia, Andrea; Iacovelli, Valerio; Agrò, Enrico Finazzi; Floris, Roberto",Eur Radiol Exp,473,18

Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 are being reported during last months, and also an increase of severe lung pathologies in domestic dogs has been detected by veterinarians in Spain. Therefore it is necessary to describe the pathological processes in those animals that show symptoms similar to those described in humans affected by COVID-19. The potential for companion animals contributing to the continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread is an urgent issue to be considered. Forty animals with pulmonary pathologies were studied by chest X-ray, ultrasound study, and computed tomography. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swab were analyzed to detect canine pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Twenty healthy dogs living in SARS-CoV-2 positive households were included. Immunoglobulin detection by different immunoassays was performed. Our findings show that sick dogs presented severe alveolar or interstitial pattern, with pulmonary opacity, parenchymal abnormalities, and bilateral lesions. Forty dogs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but Mycoplasma spp. was detected in 26 of 33 dogs. Five healthy and one pathological dog presented IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Here we report that despite detecting dogs with IgG α-SARS-CoV-2, we never obtained a positive RT-qPCR, not even in dogs with severe pulmonary disease; suggesting that even in the case of a canine infection transmission would be unlikely. Moreover, dogs living in COVID-19 positive households could have been more exposed to be infected during outbreaks.","Perisé-Barrios, Ana Judith; Tomeo-Martín, Beatriz Davinia; Gómez-Ochoa, Pablo; Delgado-Bonet, Pablo; Plaza, Pedro; Palau-Concejo, Paula; González, Jorge; Ortiz-Diez, Gustavo; Meléndez-Lazo, Antonio; Gentil, Michaela; García-Castro, Javier; Barbero-Fernández, Alicia",bioRxiv,473,20

Lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a useful tool for diagnosing many respiratory diseases. The prognostic role of LUS in COVID-19 patients has not yet been established. METHODS: Several databases were searched on 09 April 2021. The difference in LUS score between the death and survival groups, and the relationship between LUS score and COVID-19 severity were both assessed. RESULTS: The LUS score was significantly higher in the death group compared with the survival group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 8.21, 95% CI: 4.74–11.67, P < 0.001), which was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Those with mild/moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 had a progressively higher LUS score (critical vs. severe: WMD = 8.78, 95% CI: 4.17–13.38; P < 0.001; critical vs. mild/moderate/severe: WMD = 10.00, 95% CI: 6.83–13.17, P < 0.001; severe vs. moderate: WMD = 5.96, 95% CI: 3.48–8.44, P < 0.001; severe vs. mild/moderate: WMD = 7.31, 95% CI: 4.45–10.17, P < 0.001).

With a target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, EHE initially scales up effective HIV prevention and care in 57 localities that comprise the greatest proportion of annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (US). However, the EHE effort has been eclipsed by another infectious disease eleven months into the Initiative’s implementation. SARS‐COV‐2, a novel coronavirus, has infected more than eight million Americans and at least 223,000 (as of October 23, 2020) have succumbed to the disease. This commentary explores the social conditions that place communities of color at greater risk for COVID‐19 and HIV, and assesses challenges to EHE in a post COVID‐19 universe. DISCUSSION: One of the many common threads between HIV and COVID‐19 is the disproportionate impact of each disease among communities of color. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences surmised that as much as 70% of health outcomes are due to health access, socioeconomic factors and environmental conditions. Social determinants of health associated with greater HIV burden in Black and Brown communities have re‐emerged in epidemiological studies of disproportionate COVID‐19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in communities of color. Using data from the scientific literature, this commentary makes direct comparisons between HIV and COVID‐19 racial disparities across the social determinants of health. Further, I examine three sets of challenges facing EHE: 1. Challenges that hamper both the EHE and COVID‐19 response (i.e. insufficiently addressing the social determinants of health; amplification of disparities as new health technologies are introduced) 2. Challenges posed by COVID‐19 (i.e. diverting HIV resources to address COVID‐19 and tapering of EHE funding generally); and 3. Challenges unrelated to COVID‐19 (i.e. emergence of new and related health disparities; repeal of the Affordable Care Act and long‐term viability of EHE). CONCLUSION: Racism and discrimination place communities of color at greater risk for COVID‐19 as well as HIV. Achieving and sustaining an end to the U.S. HIV epidemic will require structural change to eliminate conditions that give rise to and maintain disparities.","Millett, Gregorio A.",J Int AIDS Soc,473,16

Most restrictions currently persist, although some have been gradually eased. It remains unclear if the trade-off from the unprecedented disruption to air travel was well worth for pandemic containment. METHOD: A comparative analysis was conducted on Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea’s COVID-19 response. Data on COVID-19 cases, travel-related and community interventions, socio-economic profile were consolidated. Trends on imported and local cases were analyzed using computations of moving averages, rate of change, particularly in response to distinct waves of travel-related interventions due to the outbreak in China, South Korea, Iran & Italy, and Europe. RESULTS: South Korea’s travel restrictions were observed to be consistently more lagged in terms of timeliness and magnitude, with their first wave of travel restrictions on flights departing from China implemented 34 days after the outbreak in Wuhan, compared to 22–26 days taken by Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. South Korea’s restrictions against all countries came after 91 days, compared to 78–80 days for the other three countries. The rate of change of imported cases fell by 1.08–1.43 across all four countries following the first wave of travel restrictions on departures from China, and by 0.22–0.52 in all countries except South Korea in the fifth wave against all international travellers. Delayed rate of change of local cases resulting from travel restrictions imposed by the four countries with intrinsic importation risk, were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Travel restriction was effective in preventing COVID-19 case importation in early outbreak phase, but may still be limited in preventing general local transmission. The impact of travel restrictions, regardless of promptness, in containing epidemics likely also depends on the effectiveness of local surveillance and non-pharmaceutical interventions concurrently implemented.

In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","Hilton, Joe; Keeling, Matt J",,473,16

In this review article we focus on five of these strategies or solutions to problematic instructional designs in multimedia learning: (a) the multimedia principle (use visualizations and drawings to complement texts); (b) the split-attention effect or spatial contiguity principle (show texts contiguously or integrated with visualizations); (c) the redundancy effect, alike the coherence principle (remove nonessential learning information); (d) the signaling principle (cue or signal essential learning information); and (e) the transient information effect or segmenting principle (segment or control the pace of animations and videos). Usually, both cognitive theories have investigated solutions that instructors, teachers, and designers should pursue to optimize students’ learning. Here, in a novel approach, we show that these strategies can also be used by learners who want to self-manage their cognitive load and learning process. We provide several examples of both instructor- and learner-managed solutions aligned with these strategies. When assessing which agent, either the instructor or the learner, was most effective, we observed mixed results in the literature. However, the expertise reversal effect may help predict the direction of these effects: novice students may learn better under instructor-managed conditions, whereas more expert students may learn more under learner-managed conditions.","Castro-Alonso, Juan C.; de Koning, Bjorn B.; Fiorella, Logan; Paas, Fred",Educ Psychol Rev,473,1

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool, and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Methods We collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (n=59; diagnosis from February 2 through Feb 29, 2020), and searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and three Chinese databases through March 11, 2020 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model. Results Among the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA. Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P=.02). The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10cpm in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10cpm in patients without diarrhea (P=.06). In a meta-analysis of 60 studies, comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% CI, 12.3%–24.5%); 11.8% of patients with non-severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1%–29.1%) and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9%–36.7%). In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3%–57.9%); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6%–85.1%). Conclusions In an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples from 48.1% patients—even in stool collected after respiratory samples tested negative.

To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the associative capacity of the host–virus networks in rodents and bats with the identification of those viruses with zoonotic potential. A virus database, detected by molecular methods, was constructed in the two taxonomic groups. We compiled 5,484 records: 825 in rodents and 4,659 in bats. We identified a total of 173 and 166 viruses, of which 53 and 40 are zoonotic viruses, in rodents and bats, respectively. Based on a network theory, a non‐directed bipartite host–virus network was built for each group. Subsequently, the networks were collapsed to represent the connections among hosts and viruses. We identified both discrete and connected communities. We observed a greater degree of connectivity in bat viruses and more discrete communities in rodents. The Coronaviridae recorded in bats have the highest values of degree, betweenness and closeness centralities. In rodents, higher degree positions were distributed homogeneously between viruses and hosts. At least in our database, a higher proportion of rodent viruses were zoonotic. Rodents should thus not be underestimated as important reservoirs of zoonotic disease. We found that viruses were more frequently shared among bats than in rodents. Network theory can reveal some macroecological patterns and identify risks that were previously unrecognized. For example, we found that parvovirus in megabats and Gbagroube virus in rodents may represent a zoonotic risk due to the proximity to humans and other zoonotic viruses. We propose that epidemiological surveillance programmes should consider the connectivity of network actors as a measure of the risks of dispersion and transmission.","Nieto‐Rabiela, Fabiola; Wiratsudakul, Anuwat; Suzán, Gerardo; Rico‐Chávez, Oscar",Zoonoses Public Health,473,24

Early prediction of emerging strains could be vital to pandemic preparedness but remains an open challenge. Here, we developed Strainflow, to learn the latent dimensions of 0.9 million high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and used machine learning algorithms to predict upcoming caseloads of SARS-CoV-2. In our Strainflow model, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were treated as documents, and codons as words to learn unsupervised codon embeddings (latent dimensions). We discovered that codon-level changes lead to a change in the entropy of the latent dimensions. We used a machine learning algorithm to find the most relevant latent dimensions called Dimensions of Concern (DoCs) of SARS-CoV-2 spike genes, and demonstrate their potential to provide a lead time for predicting new caseloads in several countries. The DoCs capture codons associated with global Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs), and may be surveilled to predict country-specific emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Highlights We developed a genomic surveillance model for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, Strainflow, where sequences were treated as documents with words (codons) to learn the codon context of 0.9 million spike genes using the skip-gram algorithm. Time series analysis of the information content (Entropy) of the latent dimensions learned by Strainflow shows a leading relationship with the monthly COVID-19 cases for seven countries (e.g., USA, Japan, India, and others). Machine Learning modeling of the entropy of the latent dimensions helped us to develop an epidemiological early warning system for the COVID-19 caseloads. The top codons associated with the most relevant latent dimensions (DoCs) were linked to SARS-CoV-2 variants, and these DoCs may be used as a surrogate to track the country-specific spread of the variants.

We purified more than one thousand memory B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD (receptor binding domain) antigens from 11 convalescent COVID-19 patients, and a total of 729 naturally paired heavy and light chain fragments were obtained by single B cell cloning technology. Among these, 178 recombinant monoclonal antibodies were tested positive for antigen binding, and the top 13 binders with Kd below 0.5 nM are all RBD binders. Importantly, all these 13 antibodies could block pseudoviral entry into HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2, with the best ones showing IC50s around 2-3 nM. We further identified 8 neutralizing antibodies against authentic virus with IC50s within 10 nM. Among these, 414-1 blocked authentic viral entry at IC50 of 1.75 nM and in combination with 105-38 could achieve IC50 as low as 0.45 nM. Meanwhile, we also found that 3 antibodies could cross-react with the SARS-CoV spike protein.

They can interact with various viruses by several possible mechanisms including direct binding the viral RNA. Identification of human miRNAs involved in coronavirus-host interplay is becoming important due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we performed computational prediction of high-confidence direct interactions between miRNAs and seven human coronavirus RNAs. In order to uncover the entire miRNA-virus interplay we further analyzed lungs miRNome of SARS-CoV infected mice using publicly available miRNA sequencing data. We found that miRNA miR-21-3p has the largest probability of binding the human coronavirus RNAs and being dramatically up-regulated in mouse lungs during infection induced by SARS-CoV. Further bioinformatic analysis of binding sites revealed high conservativity of miR-21-3p binding regions within RNAs of human coronaviruses and their strains.,"Nersisyan, Stepan; Engibaryan, Narek; Gorbonos, Aleksandra; Kirdey, Ksenia; Makhonin, Alexey; Tonevitsky, Alexander",bioRxiv,473,24

To seek more effective VOCs control strategies, we investigated 107 VOC species in a typical coastal city (Beihai) of South China, from August to November 2018. Meanwhile, a high-resolution anthropogenic VOCs monthly emission inventory (EI) was established for 2018. For source apportionments (SAs) reliability, comparisons of source structures derived from positive matrix factorization (PMF) and EI were made mainly in terms of reaction losses, uncertainties and specific ratios. Finally, for the source–end control, a comprehensive reactivity control index (RCI) was established by combing SAs with reactive speciation profiles. Ambient measurements showed that the average concentration of VOCs was 26.38 ppbv, dominated by alkanes (36.7%) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) (29.4%). VOC reactivity was estimated using ozone formation potential (52.35 ppbv) and propylene-equivalent concentration (4.22 ppbv). EI results displayed that the entire VOC, OFP, and propylene-equivalent emissions were 40.98 Gg, 67.98 Gg, and 105.93 Gg, respectively. Comparisons of source structures indicated that VOC SAs agreed within ±100% between two perspectives. Both PMF and EI results showed that petrochemical industry (24.0% and 33.0%), food processing and associated combustion (19.1% and 29.2%) were the significant contributors of anthropogenic VOCs, followed by other industrial processes (22.2% and 13.3%), transportation (18.9% and 12.0%), and solvent utilization (9.1% and10.5%). Aimed at VOCs abatement according to RCI: for terminal control, fifteen ambient highly reactive species (predominantly alkenes and alkanes) were targeted; for source control, the predominant anthropogenic sources (food industry, solvent usage, petrochemical industry and transportation) and their emitted highly reactive species were determined. Particularly, with low levels of ambient VOC and primary emissions, in this VOC and NOx double-controlled regime, crude disorganized emission from food industry contributed a high RCI.","Fu, Shuang; Guo, Meixiu; Luo, Jinmin; Han, Deming; Chen, Xiaojia; Jia, Haohao; Jin, Xiaodan; Liao, Haoxiang; Wang, Xin; Fan, Linping; Cheng, Jinping",Sci Total Environ,473,24

The hemagglutinin (HA), one of eight protein-coding genes, plays an important role during the early stage of infection. To study their evolution and zoonotic potential, we conducted an in silico analysis of H9N2 viruses that have infected broiler in Tehran Province, Iran between 1998 and 2007. The complete coding region of HA genes from nine H9N2 subtypes isolated from chicken flocks in Tehran Province during 1998–2007 was amplified and sequenced. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies of H9N2 subtype viruses on the basis of data of 9 viruses in this study and 30 selected strains are available in the GenBank. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed a large number of similar substitution mutations and close evolutionary relation among sequences of HA. The isolates possessed two types of amino acid motif –R–S-S-R/G-L- and -R-S-N-R/G-L- at the cleavage site of HA. The results showed that all nine representative H9N2 isolates belong to low pathogenic AIVs since none of the amino acid sequences at the cleavage site of the HA of the isolates possessed the basic motif required for highly pathogenic viruses (R-X-R/K-R). Six out of these nine isolates possessed leucine at position 226, which prevails in the sequences found in human strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all our isolates belonged to the G1-like sublineage. Also, these isolates showed some degree of homology with other H9N2 isolates, e.g., 89.46–93.93.39% with qu/HK/G1/97 and 93.39–98.39% with pa/Narita/92A/98. The available evidence indicates that HA genes of H9 influenza virus circulating in Iran during the past years were not well conserved. Our finding emphasizes the importance of reinforcing AIV surveillance, especially after the emergence of high pathogenicity in poultry in Iran.","Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, Arash; Karimi, Vahid; Tavasoti Kheiri, Masoumeh; Barin, Abbas",Comp Clin Path,473,2

Once solutions are developed, meeting capacities depends on the ability to mitigate technical, logistical and production issues. While it is difficult to predict the next outbreak, augmenting investments in preparedness, such as infectious disease surveillance, is far more effective than mustering last-minute response funds. Bringing research outputs into practice sooner rather than later is part of an agile approach to pivot and deliver solutions. Cooperative multi- country research programs, especially those funded by global biosecurity programs, develop capacity that can be applied to infectious disease surveillance and research that enhances detection, identification, and response to emerging and re-emerging pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential. Moreover, these programs enhance trust building among partners, which is essential because setting expectation and commitment are required for successful research and training. Measuring research outputs, evaluating outcomes and justifying continual investments are essential but not straightforward. Lessons learned include those related to reducing biological threats and maturing capabilities for national laboratory diagnostics strategy and related health systems. Challenges, such as growing networks, promoting scientific transparency, data and material sharing, sustaining funds and developing research strategies remain to be fully resolved.

They are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, playing critical roles in many biological processes. The purpose of this study is to analyze the requirement of cholesterol, a crucial component of lipid rafts for cell infection by pseudorabies virus (PrV). Cholesterol of plasma membrane or viral envelope was depleted with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD), and the infectivity of three strains of PrV was determined with plaque assays. The effect of adding cholesterol to MβCD-treated cells and viruses on cell infection was analyzed. Furthermore, effect of post-adsorption cholesterol depletion on PrV infection was investigated. We show that cholesterol depletion of either the plasma membrane or the viral membrane by MβCD significantly impaired the infectivity of PrV strains Kaplan, Becker, and Bartha K-61. The virus was shown to have lower cholesterol content and to respond to lower MβCD concentrations. Exogenous cholesterol added to either MβCD-treated cells or virions partially restored the virus infectivity. Optimal PrV infection requires cholesterol in viral and plasma membranes.","Ren, Xiaofeng; Yin, Jiechao; Li, Guangxing; Herrler, Georg",Curr Microbiol,473,23

This paper outlines the protocol for the WiseApp randomized control trial. The WiseApp contains real-time medication monitoring linking an electronic pill bottle and fitness tracker to the app, helping persons living with HIV (PLWH) self-manage their medication adherence and improve their overall quality of life. The primary objective of the trial is to test the effect of the WiseApp's medication adherence features on antiretroviral adherence in underserved PLWH in New York City. METHODS: This ongoing study is a two-arm randomized control trial. Participants are randomized 1:1 to the WiseApp intervention arm or the control arm at baseline and followed for 6 months. Eligibility criteria include: 18 years of age, have a diagnosis of HIV, speak and understand English or Spanish, live in the United States, own a smartphone, currently taking ART medications, and report the past 30 days adherence of 80% or less as measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), or have a viral load of over 400 copies/mL. The sample size for the trial is 200 people. All study participants receive the WiseApp, a CleverCap electronic pill bottle, and a fitness tracker. The intervention group also receives videos and health surveys centered on medication adherence and managing living with HIV as well as medication reminders. In contrast, the control group receives walk step reminders, videos, and surveys focused on overall wellness. DISCUSSION: The WiseApp Trial has the potential to improve HIV self-management applications, being one of the few randomized controlled trials of a mHealth medication adherence and HIV self-management application in the United States. The trial could also bring new opportunities for advancement in reaching economically disenfranchised and underserved populations in the United States. The real-time monitoring of the WiseApp has the potential to help providers initiate interventions to help patients resume treatment before drug resistance begins.

K777, an irreversible, covalent inactivator of cysteine proteases that has recently completed phase 1 clinical trials, reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity in several host cells: Vero E6 (EC(50)< 74 nM), HeLa/ACE2 (4 nM), Caco-2 (EC(90) = 4.3 μM), and A549/ACE2 (<80 nM). Infectivity of Calu-3 cells depended on the cell line assayed. If Calu-3/2B4 was used, EC(50) was 7 nM, but in the ATCC Calu-3 cell line without ACE2 enrichment, EC(50) was >10 μM. There was no toxicity to any of the host cell lines at 10–100 μM K777 concentration. Kinetic analysis confirmed that K777 was a potent inhibitor of human cathepsin L, whereas no inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine proteases (papain-like and 3CL-like protease) was observed. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe identified human cathepsin B and cathepsin L as the intracellular targets of this molecule in both infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. However, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was only carried out by cathepsin L. This cleavage was blocked by K777 and occurred in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a different site from that previously observed for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of K777 is mediated through inhibition of the activity of host cathepsin L and subsequent loss of cathepsin L-mediated viral spike protein processing.","Mellott, Drake M.; Tseng, Chien-Te; Drelich, Aleksandra; Fajtová, Pavla; Chenna, Bala C.; Kostomiris, Demetrios H.; Hsu, Jason; Zhu, Jiyun; Taylor, Zane W.; Kocurek, Klaudia I.; Tat, Vivian; Katzfuss, Ardala; Li, Linfeng; Giardini, Miriam A.; Skinner, Danielle; Hirata, Ken; Yoon, Michael C.; Beck, Sungjun; Carlin, Aaron F.; Clark, Alex E.; Beretta, Laura; Maneval, Daniel; Hook, Vivian; Frueh, Felix; Hurst, Brett L.; Wang, Hong; Raushel, Frank M.; O’Donoghue, Anthony J.; de Siqueira-Neto, Jair Lage; Meek, Thomas D.; McKerrow, James H.",ACS Chem Biol,473,1

The second wave of the COVID-19 infectious disease's rapid global spread has developed a severe threat to global peace, which has posed global mental health and crisis management issues worldwide. Public health implementations' aggressive actions recommended a series of precautionary safety measures by the health specialists to suppress, sustain, and manage the local transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explores adverse consequences of the COVID-19 on communities' behavioral and interventional changes that might specify transmission dynamics. This present study recommends two model strategies that help sustain the rapid transmission and COVID-19's adverse impacts on mental health in the general population and patients needing treatment. This study proposes mitigation and suppression models in the absence of a vaccine to decrease and manage the healthcare systems' burdens of treating patients.

For the TE polarization, a strong optical field was created in the slot region and its field intensity was 14× stronger than the evanescent sensing field from the TM polarization. The nanoscale confinement of the optical sensing field significantly enhanced the light–analyte interaction and improved the optical sensitivity. The sensitivity enhancement was experimentally demonstrated by measuring the polarization-dependent fluorescence emission from the tagged oligonucleotide.

We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants <32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that was anticipated to have an admission exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected at this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. RESULTS: A total of 60 infants were analysed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age <32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighed less than 1500 g. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increase in apneas (75%) and the need for oxygenotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: HRV infections are prevalent in the NICU, and preterm infants have a high risk of infections with clinical relevance.","Gonzalez-Carrasco, E.; Calvo, C.; García-García, M.L.; Beato, M.; Muñoz-Archidona, C.; Pozo, F.; Casas, I.",An Pediatr (Engl Ed),473,1

Utilizing Canadian survey data, this study assessed household- and employment-related risk factors for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 1005 English-speaking Canadian adults aged 18+ years completed a web-based survey after physical distancing measures were implemented across Canada. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of depressive symptoms with household- (household size, presence of children, residence locale) and employment-related (job with high risk of COVID-19 exposure, working from home, laid off/not working, financial worry) risk factors, controlling for demographic factors (gender, age, education, income). RESULTS: About 20.4% of the sample reported depressive symptoms at least 3 days per week. The odds of experiencing depressive symptoms 3+ days in the past week were higher among women (AOR = 1.67, p = 0.002) and younger adults (18–29 years AOR = 2.62, p < 0.001). After adjusting for demographic variables, the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms were higher in households with 4+ persons (AOR = 1.88, p = 0.01), in households with children aged 6 to 12 years (AOR = 1.98, p = 0.02), among those with a job at high risk for exposure to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.82, p = 0.01), and those experiencing financial worry due to COVID-19 (‘very worried’ AOR = 8.00, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pandemic responses must include resources for mental health interventions. Additionally, further research is needed to track mental health trajectories and inform the development, targeting, and implementation of appropriate mental health prevention and treatment interventions.","Wickens, Christine M.; Hamilton, Hayley A.; Elton-Marshall, Tara; Nigatu, Yeshambel T.; Jankowicz, Damian; Wells, Samantha",Can J Public Health,473,16

Improvement or replacement of the BCG vaccine with one that reliably protects all age groups is urgent. Concerns exist that antigens currently being evaluated are too homogeneous. To identify new protective antigens, we screened 1,781 proteins from a high-throughput proteome-wide protein purification study for antigenic activity. Forty-nine antigens (34 previously unreported) induced antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ) release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 4,452 TB and suspected TB patients and 167 healthy donors. Three (Rv1485, Rv1705c, and Rv1802) of the 20 antigens evaluated in a BALB/c mouse challenge model showed protective efficacy, reducing lung CFU counts by 66.2%, 75.8%, and 60%, respectively. Evaluation of IgG2a/IgG1 ratios and cytokine release indicated that Rv1485 and Rv1705c induce a protective Th1 immune response.

In this study, we used coevolutionary analysis, molecular simulations, and perturbation-based hierarchical network modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with a panel of antibodies targeting distinct epitopes to explore molecular mechanisms underlying binding-induced modulation of dynamics and allosteric signaling in the spike proteins. Through coevolutionary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we identified highly coevolving hotspots and functional clusters that enable a functional cross-talk between distant allosteric regions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with antibodies. Coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with mutational sensitivity mapping and perturbation-based profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes with CR3022 and CB6 antibodies enabled a detailed validation of the proposed approach and an extensive quantitative comparison with the experimental structural and deep mutagenesis scanning data. By combining in silico mutational scanning, perturbation-based modeling, and network analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with H014, S309, S2M11, and S2E12 antibodies, we demonstrated that antibodies can incur specific and functionally relevant changes by modulating allosteric propensities and collective dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. The results provide a novel insight into regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins showing that antibody-escaping mutations can preferentially target structurally adaptable energy hotspots and allosteric effector centers that control functional movements and allosteric communication in the complexes.","Verkhivker, Gennady M.; Di Paola, Luisa",J Phys Chem B,473,32

Epidemiological analysis with respect to the virus strains is limited in China. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, patterns, and molecular characteristics of NoV infection among children with AGE in China. METHODS: A total 4848 stool samples were collected from children who were admitted with AGE in Tianjin Children’s Hospital from August 2018 to July 2020. NoV was preliminarily detected using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Partial sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid genes of positive samples were amplified by conventional RT-PCR and then sequenced. The NoV genotype was determined by online Norovirus Typing Tool Version 2.0, and phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA 6.0. RESULTS: The prevalence of NoV was 26.4% (1280/4848). NoV was detected in all age groups, with the 7–12 months group having the highest detection rate (655/2014, 32.5%). NoV was detected during most part of the year with higher frequency in winter than other seasons. Based on the genetic analysis of RdRp, GII. Pe was the most predominant genotype detected at 70.7% (381/539) followed by GII.P12 at 25.4% (137/539). GII.4 was the most predominant capsid genotype detected at 65.3% (338/518) followed by GII.3 at 26.8% (139/518). Based on the genetic analysis of RdRp and capsid sequences, the strains were clustered into 10 RdRp–capsid genotypes: GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney 2012 (65.5%), GII.P12-GII.3 (27.2%), GII.P16-GII.2 (1.8%), GII.P12-GII.2 (0.2%), GII.P17-GII.17 (1.1%), GII.Pe-GII.3 (1.8%), GII.Pe-GII.2 (1.1%), GII.Pe-GII.1 (0.4%), GII.16-GII.4 Sydney 2012 (0.7%), and GII.P7-GII.6 (0.2%). The predominant NoV genotypes changed from GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney 2012 and GII.P12-GII.3 between August 2018 and July 2019 to GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney 2012 and GII.P16-GII.2 between August 2019 and July 2020. The patients with GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney 2012 genotype were more likely to suffer from vomiting symptom than those with GII.P12-GII.3. CONCLUSIONS: NoV is an important pathogen responsible for viral AGE among children in China. GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney 2012 and GII.P12-GII.3 were major recombinant genotypes. Knowledge of circulating genotypes and seasonal trends is of great importance for disease prevention and surveillance.","Fang, Yulian; Dong, Zhaoying; Liu, Yan; Wang, Wei; Hou, Mengzhu; Wu, Jinying; Wang, Lu; Zhao, Yu",BMC Infect Dis,473,20

The most prominent effect is observed when the virus binds to the ACE-2 receptors of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium. Testosterone exhibits an immunosuppressive effect, and androgens play a modulatory role on protease enzymes. It is known that various comorbidities, including obesity; pregnancy; diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2); hypertension; cancer; chronic kidney, liver, and lung diseases; cerebrovascular disease; heart conditions; human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunologic disease; and immune suppression; affect the severity of COVID-19 infection. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of reproductive aged-women. Hirsutism is observed in 70-80% of the patients, while increased testosterone levels are detected in more than 50% of the women with PCOS. This syndrome is also associated with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, increased renin-angiotensin system activity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in a remarkable number of cases. PCOS also manifests a chronic pro-inflammatory state. Hyperandrogenism through hyperinsulinemia causes adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction that result in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokine, which culminates in the creation of a chronic inflammatory state. In light of the metabolic and hormonal changes observed in women with PCOS, which make them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection, health care givers should provide special care and detailed counseling services.","Dilbaz, Berna",Turk J Obstet Gynecol,473,16

Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were developed to explore significant associations with the physical and mental component of HRQoL. Baseline dispositional optimism was a predictor of the mental component of HRQoL at follow-up; the flexible suppression of emotional expression was a predictor of the physical component of HRQoL at follow-up. From a psychogeriatric perspective, the accurate assessment of psychological factors, such as dispositional optimism and expressive flexibility, might help physicians and psychologists to recognize additional patients’ vulnerabilities during the current emergency.","Sardella, Alberto; Lenzo, Vittorio; Bonanno, George A.; Basile, Giorgio; Quattropani, Maria C.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,473,16

Against this backdrop, the authors of this study investigate which offerings industrial customers are most likely to purchase as the pandemic progresses. Drawing on positive decision theory and empirically investigating 31,353 sales opportunities across 57 countries, the authors show that the coronavirus pandemic significantly decreases industrial customers' purchase probability, especially for high-priced offerings. In countries with low uncertainty avoidance and strong long-term orientation (e.g., China, India, Singapore), purchase probability is less affected by the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic even increases purchase probability for offerings with low prices in countries where cultures are simultaneously uncertainty-avoidant and short-term oriented (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico). This is presumably because customers safeguard their operations in the face of impending supply shortages. Consequently, this helps suppliers focus on the right sales opportunities to secure their business during exogenous global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic.","Habel, Johannes; Jarotschkin, Viktor; Schmitz, Bianca; Eggert, Andreas; Plötner, Olaf",,473,26

Computed tomography (CT)-based lung-density analysis offers a fast, reliable, and quantitative assessment of lung density. Therefore, we aimed to assess the benefit of CT-based lung density measurements to predict possible severe disease progression in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty COVID-19-positive patients were included in this retrospective study. Lung density was quantified based on routinely acquired chest CTs. Presence of COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Wilcoxon test was used to compare two groups of patients. A multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex, was employed to model the relative increase of risk for severe disease, depending on the measured densities. RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients or patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed a lower proportion of medium- and low-density lung volume compared to patients on the normal ward, but a significantly larger volume of high-density lung volume (12.26 dl IQR 4.65 dl vs. 7.51 dl vs. IQR 5.39 dl, p = 0.039). In multivariate regression analysis, high-density lung volume was identified as a significant predictor of severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of high-density lung tissue showed a significant association with severe COVID-19, with odds ratios of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.09-2.00) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.03-2.11) for requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation, respectively. Acknowledging our small sample size as an important limitation; our study might thus suggest that high-density lung tissue could serve as a possible predictor of severe COVID-19.","Bressem, Keno K.; Adams, Lisa C.; Albrecht, Jakob; Petersen, Antonie; Thieß, Hans-Martin; Niehues, Alexandra; Niehues, Stefan M.; Vahldiek, Janis L.",Pol J Radiol,473,16

In March, the French medical authorities organized a medical surveillance of the medical staff who had returned from the French hospital in Hanoi. Each person presenting or not with respiratory symptoms was sampled systematically by the nearest general practitioner (GP) belonging to the influenza network surveillance in the community called GROG and the samples were sent to the NICs located either in Paris or in Lyon. We also received samples from patients hospitalized in the south of France suffering from acute respiratory infection soon after a journey in Asia. We implemented a PCR diagnosis for the human respiratory viruses: influenza A and B, Parainfluenza (Type 1 to Type 4), Metapneumovirus, RSV, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Adenovirus. In April, we set up the PCR detection of the SARS-associated coronavirus Urbani strain. The practitioners performed respiratory samples. From 14 March to 15 May we received and tested 88 respiratory samples, respectively, 19 were realized by GPs from the community network and 69 came from hospitalized patients. We never detected the urbani coronavirus strain. However, we detected respiratory viruses in 24% of the cases: the most frequent virus was influenza A H3N2 (11%) and Parainfluenza type 3 (8%). RSV, influenza A H1N1 and Rhinovirus were also detected 2, 1 and 1 cases, respectively. All the positive samples except the rhinovirus came from hospitalized patients. The patients were sampled once and all of them recovered rapidly.","Valette, Martine; Lina, Bruno",Int Congr Ser,473,28

Commercially available vaccines are only partially effective in protection against PRRSV. Moreover, modified live vaccines may allow virus shedding, and could revert generating virulent phenotypes. Therefore, new efficient vaccines are required. Vaccines based on recombinant virus genomes (virus vectored vaccines) against PRRSV could represent a safe alternative for the generation of modified live vaccines. In this paper, current vectored vaccines to protect against PRRSV are revised, including those based on pseudorabies virus, poxvirus, adenovirus, and virus replicons. Special attention has been provided to the use of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as vector for the expression of PRRSV antigens. This vector has the capability of expressing high levels of heterologous genes, is a potent interferon-α inducer, and presents antigens in mucosal surfaces, eliciting both secretory and systemic immunity. A TGEV derived vector (rTGEV) was generated, expressing PRRSV wild type or modified GP5 and M proteins, described as the main inducers of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response, respectively. Protection experiments showed that vaccinated animals developed a faster and stronger humoral immune response than the non-vaccinated ones. Partial protection in challenged animals was observed, as vaccinated pigs showed decreased lung damage when compared with the non-vaccinated ones. Nevertheless, the level of neutralizing antibodies was low, what may explain the limited protection observed. Several strategies are proposed to improve current rTGEV vectors expressing PRRSV antigens.","Cruz, Jazmina L.G.; Zúñiga, Sonia; Bécares, Martina; Sola, Isabel; Ceriani, Juan E.; Juanola, Sandra; Plana, Juan; Enjuanes, Luis",Virus Res,473,5

However, there is a paucity of evidence-based treatments to address this clinical problem. An open-label, pilot study in the target population showed that treatment with oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a widely available dietary supplement, was associated with reduction in NSSI frequency. In preparation for a biologically informed design of an efficacy trial, a critical preliminary step is to clarify NAC’s biological signatures, or measures of the mechanisms underlying its clinical effects. Toward that end, we propose a 2-stage project to investigate NAC’s biological signatures (changes in glutathione (GSH) and/or glutamate (Glu)) in women with NSSI. The first stage; a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study will focus on identifying the optimal dose to achieve meaningful change in GSH and Glu during short-term (4 weeks) NAC treatment in 36 women aged 16–24 years with NSSI. Go/No-go criteria to determine if the study will progress to the second stage include pre-specified changes in brain and blood measures of GSH. Changes in the brain GSH are measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The dose for the stage 2 will be selected based on the biological changes and the tolerability observed in the stage 1. The stage 2 will seek to replicate the biological signature findings in an 8-week trial in a new patient cohort, and examine the relationships among biological signatures, NAC pharmacokinetics and clinical response. This 2-stage project is unique as it unifies clinical psychiatric measurements, quantitative MRS and pharmacological approaches in the first placebo-controlled clinical trial of NAC in young women with NSSI.

Unfortunately, until we can safely, rapidly, and affordably vaccinate enough people to achieve collective immunity, we cannot afford to disregard the benefits of naturally acquired immunity in those, whose prior documented infections have already run their course. As long as the vaccine manufacturing, supply, or administration are limited in capacity, vaccination of individuals with naturally acquired immunity at the expense of others without any immune protection is inherently inequitable, and violates the principle of justice in biomedical ethics. Any preventable disease acquired during the period of such unnecessary delay in vaccination should not be overlooked, as it may and will result in some additional morbidity, mortality, related hospitalizations, and expense. Low vaccine production capacity complicated by inefficiencies in vaccine administration suggests, that vaccinating preferentially those without any prior protection will result in fewer natural infections more rapidly.","Krsak, Martin; Harry, Brian L; Palmer, Brent E; Franco-Paredes, Carlos",Viral immunol,473,4

Following the biopsychosocial model of health, the goal of the current study was to predict people’s psychological well-being (PWB) during the initial lockdown phase of the pandemic and to investigate which coping strategies were most common among people with low and high PWB. Participants were 938 volunteers in the United States who responded to an online survey during the lockdown in April 2020. The main findings were that all three groups of variables, biological, psychological, and socio-economic, significantly contributed to PWB explaining 53% variance. Social loneliness and sense of agency were the strongest predictors. PWB was significantly predicted by physical health (not gender nor age); by spirituality, emotional loneliness, social loneliness, and sense of agency; by job security (not income, nor neighborhood safety, nor hours spent on social media). Comparing the coping strategies of participants, results show more intentional coping in the high-PWB group and more passive coping in the low-PWB group. During this unprecedented pandemic, the findings highlight that ability to sustainably cope with the global shifts in daily life depends on actively and intentionally attending to PWB by being one’s own agent for physical health, spiritual health, and social connection.","Tuason, Ma.

This study utilizes a continuously updated Electronic Medical Record (EMR) network to assess the possible benefits of influenza vaccination mitigating critical adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from 56 healthcare organizations (HCOs). METHODS: The de-identified records of 73,346,583 patients were retrospectively screened. Two cohorts of 37,377 patients, having either received or not received influenza vaccination six months–two weeks prior to SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnosis, were created using Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) and logical observation identifiers names and codes (LOINC) codes. Adverse outcomes within 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were compared between cohorts. Outcomes were assessed with stringent propensity score matching including age, race, ethnicity, gender, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, heart disease, and lifestyle habits such as smoking. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced decreased sepsis (p<0.01, Risk Ratio: 1.361–1.450, 95% CI:1.123–1.699, NNT:286) and stroke (p<0.02, RR: 1.451–1.580, 95% CI:1.075–2.034, NNT:625) across all time points. ICU admissions were lower in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients receiving the influenza vaccine at 30, 90, and 120 days (p<0.03, RR: 1.174–1.200, 95% CI:1.003–1.385, NNT:435), while approaching significance at 60 days (p = 0.0509, RR: 1.156, 95% CI:0.999–1.338). Patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced fewer DVTs 60–120 days after positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (p<0.02, RR:1.41–1.530, 95% CI:1.082–2.076, NNT:1000) and experienced fewer emergency department (ED) visits 90–120 days post SARS-CoV-2-positive diagnosis (p<0.01, RR:1.204–1.580, 95% CI: 1.050–1.476, NNT:176). CONCLUSION: Our analysis outlines the potential protective effect of influenza vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients against adverse outcomes within 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of a positive diagnosis. Significant findings favoring influenza vaccination mitigating the risks of sepsis, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), emergency department (ED) & Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions suggest a potential protective effect that could benefit populations without readily available access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Thus further investigation with future prospective studies is warranted.","Taghioff, Susan M.; Slavin, Benjamin R.; Holton, Tripp; Singh, Devinder",PLoS One,473,1

We utilized a custom next-generation sequencing approach and allele-specific genotyping assays to detect and validate 280 biallelic variants across all 10 bovine TLR genes, including 71 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one putative nonsense SNP. Bayesian haplotype reconstructions and median joining networks revealed haplotype sharing between Bos taurus taurus and Bos taurus indicus breeds at every locus, and specialized beef and dairy breeds could not be differentiated despite an average polymorphism density of 1 marker/158 bp. Collectively, 160 tagSNPs and two tag insertion-deletion mutations (indels) were sufficient to predict 100% of the variation at 280 variable sites for both Bos subspecies and their hybrids, whereas 118 tagSNPs and 1 tagIndel predictively captured 100% of the variation at 235 variable sites for B. t. taurus. Polyphen and SIFT analyses of amino acid (AA) replacements encoded by bovine TLR SNPs indicated that up to 32% of the AA substitutions were expected to impact protein function. Classical and newly developed tests of diversity provide strong support for balancing selection operating on TLR3 and TLR8, and purifying selection acting on TLR10. An investigation of the persistence and continuity of linkage disequilibrium (r(2)≥0.50) between adjacent variable sites also supported the presence of selection acting on TLR3 and TLR8. A case-control study employing validated variants from bovine TLR genes recognizing bacterial ligands revealed six SNPs potentially eliciting small effects on susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium spp paratuberculosis infection in dairy cattle. The results of this study will broadly impact domestic cattle research by providing the necessary foundation to explore several avenues of bovine translational genomics, and the potential for marker-assisted vaccination.","Fisher, Colleen A.; Bhattarai, Eric K.; Osterstock, Jason B.; Dowd, Scot E.; Seabury, Paul M.; Vikram, Meenu; Whitlock, Robert H.; Schukken, Ynte H.; Schnabel, Robert D.; Taylor, Jeremy F.; Womack, James E.; Seabury, Christopher M.",PLoS One,473,10

We previously synthesized a siRNA targeting the CVB3 protease 2A (siRNA/2A) gene and achieved reduction of CVB3 replication by 92% in vitro. However, like other drugs under development, CVB3 siRNA faces a major challenge of targeted delivery. In this study, we investigated a novel approach to deliver CVB3 siRNAs to a specific cell population (e.g. HeLa cells containing folate receptor) using receptor ligand (folate)-linked packaging RNA (pRNA) from bacterial phage phi29. pRNA monomers can spontaneously form dimers and multimers under optimal conditions by base-pairing between their stem loops. By covalently linking a fluorescence-tag to folate, we delivered the conjugate specifically to HeLa cells without the need of transfection. We further demonstrated that pRNA covalently conjugated to siRNA/2A achieved an equivalent antiviral effect to that of the siRNA/2A alone. Finally, the drug targeted delivery was further evaluated by using pRNA monomers or dimers, which carried both the siRNA/2A and folate ligand and demonstrated that both of them strongly inhibited CVB3 replication. These data indicate that pRNA as a siRNA carrier can specifically deliver the drug to target cells via its ligand and specific receptor interaction and inhibit virus replication effectively.","Zhang, Huifang M.; Su, Yue; Guo, Songchuan; Yuan, Ji; Lim, Travis; Liu, Jing; Guo, Peixuan; Yang, Decheng",Antiviral Research,473,0

Symptomatic patients are referred via an urgent pathway and although most are investigated with colonoscopy <4% are diagnosed with cancer. There is therefore a need for a suitable triage tool to prioritise investigations. This study retrospectively examined performance of various triage tools in patients awaiting investigation on the urgent lower gastrointestinal cancer pathway DESIGN: All patients over 40 years of age on the urgent pathway awaiting investigation for suspected CRC on 1 May were included. After 6 months, outcomes were evaluated and the performance of the faecal immunochemical test (FIT), faecal haemoglobin concentration, age and sex test (FAST) and the artificial intelligence algorithm ColonFlag were examined. RESULTS: 532 completed investigations and received a diagnosis; 15 had CRC. 388 had a valid FIT result, of whom 11 had CRC; FAST Score ≥4.5 had sensitivity of 72.7%, specificity of 80.6% and would have failed to detect three tumours. Faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) at cut-off of 10 µg/g and ColonFlag had equal sensitivity of 81.82%, ColonFlag had greater specificity 73.47%, compared with 64.99%. Both tests would have failed to detect two tumours but not in the same patients; when used in combination, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 49.4%. When ColonFlag was applied to the cohort of 532, an additional four tumours would have been detected in patients without a valid FIT.

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, parallel 3-arm (1:1:1 ratio), open-label, Phase IV platform trial of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with late stage 1 or stage 2 COVID-19-related disease, with a diagnosis based either on a positive assay or high suspicion of COVID-19 infection by clinical and/or radiological assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 and over, with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of COVID-19-related disease (with/without a positive COVID-19 test) AND a Risk count (as defined below) >3 OR ≥3 if risk count includes “Radiographic severity score >3”. A risk count is calculated by the following features on admission (1 point for each): radiographic severity score >3, male gender, non-white ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophils >8.0 x10(9)/L, age >40 years and CRP >40 mg/L. Patients should be considered an appropriate subject for intervention with immunomodulatory therapies in the opinion of the investigator and be able to be maintained on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during the inpatient dosing period, according to local guidelines. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the additional file 1 should be fulfilled. Patients will be enrolled prior to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, cardiac or renal support. Participants will be recruited across multiple centres including initially at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospital of Wales, Gloucestershire Royal Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Each active comparator arm will be compared against standard of care (SoC). The immunomodulatory drugs were selected from a panel of licenced candidates by a drug evaluation committee, which considered potential efficacy, potential toxicity, scalability and novelty of each strategy. The initial active arms comprise baricitinib and ravulizumab. Baricitinib will be given 4 mg orally (once daily (OD)) on days 1-14 or until day of discharge. The dose will be reduced to 2 mg OD for patients aged > 75 years and those with an estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/min. Ravulizumab will be administered intravenously once according to the licensed weight-based dosing regimen (see Additional file 1). Each active arm will be compared with standard of care alone. No comparisons will be made between active arms in this platform trial. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the incidence (from baseline up to Day 14) of any one of the events (whichever comes first): death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised using a central web-based randomisation service (Sealed Envelope) in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site to one of the treatment arms or SoC. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Data analysis will not be blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): There is no fixed sample size for this study. Serial interim analyses will be triggered by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), including analysis after 125 patients are recruited to each arm, 375 in total assuming 3 arms. Additional interim analyses are projected after 229 patients per arm, and potentially then after 469 per arm, but additional analyses may be triggered by the IDMC.

Cleavage between the VPg and Pro domains is inefficient in vitro and in E. coli, resulting in the accumulation of the VPg-Pro. In this study, we have compared the trans-activity of the Pro and VPg-Pro on various P1- and P2-derived precursors. Recombinant Pro and VPg-Pro were partially purified using an E. coli expression system. A mutation of the VPg-Pro cleavage site was introduced into the VPg-Pro to prevent slow release of the Pro. The Pro was five to ten times more active than the VPg-Pro on two P2 cleavage sites (at the N- and C-termini of the movement protein domain) and was approximately two times more active than the VPg-Pro on the third P2 cleavage site (between the X3 and X4 domains). Neither the Pro nor the VPg-Pro could cleave in trans P1-derived substrates containing the three cleavage sites delineating the X1, X2, putative NTP-binding protein and VPg domains. These results are discussed in light of the possible regulation of the proteinase activity during virus replication.","Chisholm, Joan; Wieczorek, Andrew; Sanfaçon, Hélène",Virus Research,473,3

Eighteen experienced anesthetists intubated the trachea of a manikin with a normal airway 6 times using a direct laryngoscope, a McGRATH™ MAC videolaryngoscope, or an airway scope AWS-S200NK videolaryngoscope with or without an aerosol box. Although the aerosol box prolonged the time to successful intubation and decreased the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score when using a direct laryngoscope, the statistically significant differences were clinically irrelevant. When a McGRATH™ MAC and an AWS-S200NK were used, the times to successful intubation and POGO scores were comparable with and without the aerosol box. When using any of the laryngoscopes, there were no statistically significant differences in the Cormack–Lehane grade and peak force to maxillary incisors with and without the aerosol box. In summary, the effect of an aerosol box on tracheal intubation difficulty is not clinically relevant when an experienced anesthetist intubates the trachea in a normal airway condition.","Wakabayashi, Ryo; Ishida, Takashi; Yamada, Tomokatsu; Kawamata, Mikito",J Anesth,473,26

This study evaluates the global impact of lockdowns on air pollutants using tropospheric and ground-level indicators over a five-month period. Moreover, the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 cases and mortalities was examined. Changes in the global tropospheric (NO(2), aerosols, and O(3)) and ground-level (PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), and O(3)) pollutants were observed, and the maximum air quality improvement was observed immediately after lockdown. Except for a few countries, a decline in air pollutants correlated with a reduction in Land Surface Temperature (LST). Notably, regions with higher tropospheric NO(2) and aerosol concentrations were also COVID-19 hotspots. Our analysis showed moderate positive correlation for NO(2) with COVID-19 cases (R(2) = 0.33; r = 0.57, P = 0.006) and mortalities (R(2) = 0.40; r = 0.63, P = 0.015), while O(3) showed a weak-moderate positive correlation with COVID-19 cases (R(2) = 0.22; r = 0.47, P = 0.003) and mortalities (R(2) = 0.12; r = 0.35, P = 0.012).

Each class of IRES has a conserved structure and promotes 5′-end-independent initiation of translation by a different mechanism. Picornavirus 5′UTRs, including the IRES, evolve independently of other parts of the genome and can move between genomes, most commonly by intratypic recombination. We review accumulating evidence that IRESs are genetic entities that can also move between members of different genera and even between families. Type IV IRESs, first identified in the Hepacivirus genus, have subsequently been identified in over 25 genera of Picornaviridae, juxtaposed against diverse coding sequences. In several genera, members have either type IV IRES or an IRES of type I, II or III. Similarly, in the genus Pegivirus, members contain either a type IV IRES or an unrelated type; both classes of IRES also occur in members of the genus Hepacivirus. IRESs utilize different mechanisms, have different factor requirements and contain determinants of viral growth, pathogenesis and cell type specificity.

Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) face a substantially higher risk of infection and death due to excessive COVID-19 exposure. This review aimed at summarizing the evidence of the physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We used the Arksey O’Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. A systematic literature search was conducted using two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar. We found 154 studies, and out of which 10 met our criteria. We collected information on the date of publication, first author’s country, the title of the article, study design, study population, intervention and outcome, and key findings, and divided all research articles into two domains: physical and mental health impact. RESULTS: We reviewed a total of 154 articles from PubMed (126) and Google Scholar (28), of which 58 were found to be duplicate articles and were excluded. Of the remaining 96 articles, 82 were excluded after screening for eligibility, and 4 articles did not have available full texts. Ten full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study. Our findings identified the following risk factors for COVID-19-related health impact: working in a high-risk department, diagnosed family member, inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, improper PPE use, close contact with patients (≥ 12 times/day), long daily contact hours (≥ 15 h), and unprotected exposure. The most common symptoms identified amongst HCWs were fever (85%), cough (70%), and weakness (70%). Prolonged PPE usage led to cutaneous manifestations and skin damage (97%), with the nasal bridge (83%) most commonly affected site. HCWs experienced high levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Female HCWs and nurses were disproportionately affected. CONCLUSION: The frontline healthcare workers are at risk of physical and mental consequences directly as the result of providing care to patients with COVID-19. Even though there are few intervention studies, early data suggest implementation strategies to reduce the chances of infections, shorter shift lengths, and mechanisms for mental health support could reduce the morbidity and mortality amongst HCWs.","Shaukat, Natasha; Ali, Daniyal Mansoor; Razzak, Junaid",Int J Emerg Med,473,16

The findings were replicated after a week’s delay. Analyses on longitudinal data showed that state optimism, state well-being, and meaning presence influenced one another over time. These variables also mediated the cultural differences in one another. These results are consistent with cultural work on naïve dialecticism and non-linear lay theory of change.

Ceci dans le cadre d’une réaction d’hypersensibilité retardée, et/ou bien d’une réaction granulomateuse. Leur prévention reste assez mal connue.

Summary The complications of tattoos are multiple and known for many years. However, their success explains their exponential multiplication in all countries. This confirmed the development of two new complications: a localized or remote skin sarcoidosis reaction, as well as the development of clinical and histological uveitis. This is in the context of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, or a granulomatous reaction. Their prevention remains rather poorly known. It requires that each tattoo-carrying subject perform a systemic sarcoidosis check-up as well as an ophthalmological investigation in search of possible uveitis. If confirmed, preventive and therapeutic measures will be carried out in emergencies to avoid blindness. These new complications confirm the extreme severity of the use of uncontrolled inks, real toxic and sensitizing mixtures, especially apparently during extensive colorful tattoos. These particularly aggressive colored inks release multiple substances and nanoparticles into the body, not all of which are measured in the medium and long term.","Bazex, J.; Arné, J.-L.; Lambert, D.",Bull Acad Natl Med,473,10

Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG sequences. Arginine methylation of N protein was confirmed by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated by cell culture. We demonstrate that arginine methylation of N protein is required for its RNA binding capacity, since treatment with a type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95K or R177K inhibited interaction with the 5’-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. We defined the N interactome in HEK293 cells with or without MS023 treatment and identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates including the known interactor, G3BP1, and other components of stress granules (SG). Methylation of N protein at R95 regulates another function namely its property to suppress the formation of SGs. MS023 treatment or R95K substitution blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the co-expression of methylarginine reader TDRD3 quenched N-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pre-treatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. With type I PRMT inhibitors being in clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may be an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.","Cai, Ting; Yu, Zhenbao; Wang, Zhen; Liang, Chen; Richard, Stéphane",bioRxiv,473,33

To this end, the authors employ Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and robust panel regressions to quantify the overall co-movement between temperature, air quality, and daily cases of COVID-19 from 29 February to 17 July 2020. Overall empirical results show that temperature may not be a determinant to induce COVID-19 spread in Spain, while the rising temperature may reduce the virus transmission. However, the correlation and regression findings illustrate that air quality may speed up the transmission rate of COVID-19. Our findings are contrary to the earlier studies, which show a significant impact of temperature in raising the COVID-19 spread.

Measures completed at baseline (n = 127; 11.7 years) and follow-up (n = 88; 12.8 years) included accelerometer-based 24-h movement behaviours, self-reported recreational screen use and psychosocial health (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Kessler’s Psychological Distress Scale). Linear mixed models were used to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the 24-h movement behaviour composition and recreational screen use levels with psychosocial health outcomes. Overall, the movement behaviour composition (p < 0.05) and recreational screen use levels (p < 0.01) were both cross-sectionally but not longitudinally associated with psychosocial health outcomes. Relative to other behaviours, sleep was negatively associated, while light-intensity PA was positively associated with internalising problems and total difficulties scores. ST was positively associated with internalising problems. High levels of recreational screen use (>2 h/day) were associated with greater externalising problems, total difficulties scores and psychological distress. These findings reinforce the importance of achieving a balance between different types of movement behaviours over a 24-h period for psychosocial health.","Chong, Kar Hau; Parrish, Anne-Maree; Cliff, Dylan P.; Dumuid, Dorothea; Okely, Anthony D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,473,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among a sample of dentists who worked in Jordan and India in June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: This study included a total of 177 dentists in Jordan and India that were practicing during the early months of the pandemic. Most dentists were seeing <6 patients per day. The most common emergency treatments during the pandemic by Jordanian dentists were abscesses (51.8%) and cellulitis (44.6%) vs (44.6%) abscesses and (35.5%) pulpitis in India. There was a high adoption of all elements of the PPE protocol. Most participants never or rarely used N(2)O sedation to manage their patients in Jordan and India (80.4 and 71.1%), respectively. Participants in Jordan and India that considered treatment non-aerosol-generating procedures (non-AGP) were (82.1 vs 97.5%, p = 0.000), respectively. CONCLUSION: Most of the surveyed dentists believe the extra PPE acts as a barrier to patient communication and child behavior management and would consider modifying the PPE to be more child-friendly. Most dentists consider non-AGP procedures and silver diamine fluoride (SDF) to be practical ways to practice safer dentistry, yet more training and information is needed for dentists treating children to provide a more confident safe environment for both dentists and their patients.

The most effective and cheapest way to combat influenza is through vaccination. In many countries, including Poland, for each age group, the rate of vaccination against influenza is still at a very low level, which generates high social costs, not infrequently family tragedies in the case of irreversible complications of influenza, or death of a loved one. Regular vaccination should be part of good medical practice, as well as an individual’s engagement in their own health and in that of their family.

After decades of energy-efficiency programs and targeted policies, the average low-income household still spends a disproportionately large percentage of its income on energy bills. Issues of equity, race and justice are increasingly linked to the problem of persistent energy burdens. In the complex ecosystem of stakeholders that influence energy burden, key gaps still exist in the understanding of causes and solutions. In particular, limited research has examined the role of landlords and property managers in multifamily housing. Over the past decade, research has increasingly illuminated (1) the link between energy burden and health, (2) promising pathways to democratize energy efficiency and rooftop solar, and (3) issues of equity, justice, and African-American populations.

These infections represent a major cause of death worldwide and pneumonia remains the first cause of death from infectious origin in France. Three nosological entities are usually described according to the anatomic localization of the infectious process: acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and bronchopneumonia (if the infection involves the bronchial tree and the lung parenchyma). If bronchial infection occurs within the context of a chronic respiratory tract disease, it is called acute decompensation of chronic lung disease (usually chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The major diagnostic difficulties are to be able to confirm alveolar implication in the infectious process and to determine the pathogenic agent(s) responsible for the clinical pattern. This information is essential for subsequent care depends. Apart from clinical examination, essential in this context, only chest-X-rays can be of any help to confirm alveolar involvement in the disease process. On the contrary, the interest of systematic microbiological confirmation and its value according to various techniques and swab conditions may be questioned for the clinical diagnosis. Microbiological confirmation does not seem essential in every case. The feasibility and relevance of microbiological techniques must be determined before any decision is taken on documentation.

A new questionnaire was developed to evaluate participants’ hesitancy. The study was conducted online in November, 2020, using convenience sampling. A total of 538 individuals from the general Greek population participated in the study and completed the Hesitancy Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), the Short Health Anxiety Inventory and a COVID-19-related worry question. The Hesitancy Questionnaire proved to have adequate psychometric properties. Correlation with anxiety as assessed by GAD-2 proved to be significant but low, indicating that the two scales are measuring two different concepts. The greatest hesitancy was observed in older adults for both genders (males, M = 40.86, SD = 15.24; females, M = 49.34, SD = 14.74). Women in general appeared more hesitant than men scoring higher (males, M = 36.13, SD = 15.25; females, M = 42.63, SD = 17.31) with a statistically significant difference [t(536) = − 3.706, p = .001).

Global manufacturing bases were affected strongly by workforce shortages associated with the spread of COVID-19, and are working to increase productivity by embracing digital manufacturing technologies that take advantage of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) that offer the promise of improved connectivity among supply chains. This trend can increase and smooth the flow of social capital, which is a potential resource in supply chains and can affect supply chain performance in healthcare industry. However, such an issue has not been properly recognized as the best practice in healthcare industry. Thus, this study investigates empirically the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance in healthcare manufacturing companies based on previous research that proposed a role for social capital. We surveyed the staff of domestic small and medium-sized healthcare manufacturing companies in South Korea currently operating or planning to deploy digital manufacturing technologies. Online and email surveys were utilized to collect the data. Invalid responses were excluded and the remaining 130 responses were analyzed using a structural equation model in SPSS with the AMOS module. We found that digitalization has a positive effect on the formation of social capital, which in turn has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The direct effect of digitalization on supply chain performance is small, and relatively large portions are mediated and influenced by social capital. The establishment of strategic relationships in the healthcare manufacturing industry is significant, as supply chain networks and production processes can influence the intended use of factory output. Companies should, therefore, secure timely and accurate information to manage the flow of products and services. The formation of social capital in the supply chain can help visualize entire supply chains and has a positive effect on real-time information-sharing among key elements of those chains.","Kim, Hee Kyung; Lee, Chang Won",Int J Environ Res Public Health,473,20

However, the transmission of hundreds of megabytes of Sectional Medical Images (SMIs) from hospital's Intranet to the Internet has the problems of efficiency, cost, and security. This article proposes a novel lightweight sharing scheme for permitting Internet users to quickly and safely access the SMIs from a hospital using an Internet computer anywhere but without relying on a virtual private network or another complex deployment. METHODS: A four-level endpoint network penetration scheme based on the existing hospital network facilities and information security rules was proposed to realize the secure and lightweight sharing of SMIs over the Internet. A “Master-Slave” interaction to the interactive characteristics of multiplanar reconstruction and maximum/minimum/average intensity projection was designed to enhance the user experience. Finally, a prototype system was established. RESULTS: When accessing SMIs with a data size ranging from 251.6 to 307.04 MB with 200 kBps client bandwidth (extreme test), the network response time to each interactive request remained at approximately 1 s, the original SMIs were kept in the hospital, and the deployment did not require a complex process; the imaging quality and interactive experience were recognized by radiologists. CONCLUSIONS: This solution could serve Internet medicine at a low cost and may promote the diversified development of mobile medical technology. Under the current COVID-19 epidemic situation, we expect that it could play a low-cost and high-efficiency role in remote emergency support.","Qiao, Liang; Wu, Hao; Wu, Yi; Wu, Wenjing; Yang, Jingyi; Nian, Yongjian; Chen, Mingsheng; Bai, Sen; Huang, Hao; Qiu, Mingguo",J Healthc Eng,473,24

Studying the changes of electrocardiogram is of great significance for the diagnosis of patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis method was adopted to compare the electrocardiogram changes between COVID‐19 critically severe and severe patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation of the levels of serum indexes and past medical history with ST‐T changes and atrial fibrillation. And the correlation of ECG parameters with in‐hospital death and ventilator use were investigated by using the same methods. RESULTS: The incidence of male, stroke, elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI), N‐terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), d‐dimer, high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP), hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia in the critically ill patients was higher than that in severe patients. There were differences in ST‐T changes, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial tachycardia between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated cTnI and NT‐proBNP were the independent risk factors of ST‐T changes. Elevated NT‐proBNP and age were the independent risk factors of atrial fibrillation. Sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation were the independent risk factors of in‐hospital death and ventilator use. CONCLUSION: ST‐T changes, sinus tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation are with great significance in the diagnosis of the severity, myocardia injury, and cardiac insufficiency of COVID‐19 patients. Sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation could be used as independent variables predicting in‐hospital death and ventilator use.","Wang, Yina; Chen, Lie; Wang, Jingyi; He, Xingwei; Huang, Fen; Chen, Jing; Yang, Xiaoyun",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,473,12

Few empirical studies have sought to define useful practices for engaging in social media for academic use in the health professions. Given the increasing importance of these platforms, we sought to define good practices and potential pitfalls with help of those respected for their work in this new field. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study, guided by constructivist grounded theory principles, of 17 emerging experts in the field of academic social media. We engaged in a snowball sampling technique and conducted a series of semi-structured interviews. The analytic team consisted of a diverse group of researchers with a range of experience in social media. RESULTS: Understanding the strengths of various platforms was deemed to be of critical importance across all the participants. Key to building online engagement were the following: 1) Culture-building strategies; 2) Tailoring the message; 3) Responsiveness; and 4) Heeding rules of online engagement. Several points of caution were noted within our participants’ interviews. These were grouped into caveat emptor and the need for critical appraisal, and common pitfalls when broadcasting one’s self. DISCUSSION: Our participants were able to share a number of key practices that are central to developing and sharing educational content via social media.

Efforts to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication enzymes and better understand the mechanisms underlying viral RNA synthesis have largely relied on biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories, limiting throughput and accessibility. Recently, replicon systems have been proposed that involve ~30 kb RNA-based replicons or large plasmids that express the viral structural and non-structural proteins (nsp) in addition to a positive-sense reporter RNA. Unfortunately, these assays are not user-friendly due to plasmid instability or a poor signal to background ratio. We here present a simple mini-genome assay consisting of a ~2.5 kb-long negative-sense, nanoluciferase-encoding sub-genomic reporter RNA that is expressed from a plasmid, and amplified and transcribed by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase core proteins nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12. We show that expression of nsp7, 8 and 12 is sufficient to obtain robust positive- and negative-sense RNA synthesis in cell culture, that addition of other nsps modulates expression levels, and that replication of the reporter RNA can be inhibited by active site mutations in nsp12 or the SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitor remdesivir. The mini-genome assay provides a signal that is 170-fold above background on average, providing excellent sensitivity for high-throughput screens, while the use of small plasmids facilitates site-directed mutagenesis for fundamental analyses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. Importance statement The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it essential to better understand the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2, and to search for compounds that can block the activity of key SARS-CoV-2 replication enzymes. However, studies with live SARS-CoV-2 require biosafety level 3 facilities, while existing replicon systems depend on long positive-sense subgenomes that are often difficult to manipulate or produce a high background signal, limiting drug-screens and a rapid analysis of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make it easier to study emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants and screen for inhibitors, we developed a simple mini-replicon that produces a minimal background signal, that can be used in any tissue culture lab, and that only requires four small plasmids to work.","Vial, Thomas; Oade, Michael S.; Russell, Colin A.; Eggink, Dirk; te Velthuis, Aartjan J.W.",bioRxiv,473,2

After discharge, these patients often have extensive health care needs, but out-of-pocket burden for this care is poorly described. We assessed out-of-pocket spending within 90 days of discharge from COVID-19 hospitalization among privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients. METHODS: In May 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the IQVIA PharMetrics(®) Plus for Academics Database, a national de-identified claims database. Among privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March-June 2020, we calculated mean out-of-pocket spending for care within 90 days of discharge. For context, we repeated analyses for patients hospitalized for pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 1,465 COVID-19 patients included, 516 (35.2%) and 949 (64.8%) were covered by private insurance and Medicare Advantage plans. Among these patients, mean (SD) post-discharge out-of-pocket spending was $534 (1,045) and $680 (1,360); spending exceeded $2,000 for 7.0% and 10.3%. Compared with pneumonia patients, mean post-discharge out-of-pocket spending among COVID-19 patients was higher among the privately insured ($534 vs $445) and lower among Medicare Advantage patients ($680 vs $918). CONCLUSIONS: For the privately insured, post-discharge out-of-pocket spending was higher among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 than among patients hospitalized for pneumonia. The opposite was true for Medicare Advantage patients, potentially because insurer cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 treatment covered the costs of some post-discharge care, such as COVID-19 readmissions. Nonetheless, given the high volume of U.S. COVID-19 hospitalizations to date, our findings suggest a large number of Americans have experienced substantial financial burden for post-discharge care.","Chua, Kao-Ping; Conti, Rena M.; Becker, Nora V.",medRxiv,473,17

During infection, MERS-CoV regulates several host cellular processes including antiviral response genes. In order to determine if the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV (MERS-N) plays a role in viral–host interactions, a murine monoclonal antibody was generated so as to allow detection of the protein in infected cells as well as in overexpression system. Then, MERS-N was stably overexpressed in A549 cells, and a PCR array containing 84 genes was used to screen for genes transcriptionally regulated by it. Several up-regulated antiviral genes, namely TNF, IL6, IL8, and CXCL10, were selected for independent validation in transiently transfected 293FT cells. Out of these, the overexpression of MERS-N was found to up-regulate CXCL10 at both transcriptional and translational levels. Interestingly, CXCL10 has been reported to be up-regulated in MERS-CoV infected airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblast cells, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. High secretions and persistent increase of CXCL10 in MERS-CoV patients have been also associated with severity of disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the MERS-N protein is one of the contributing factors for CXCL10 up-regulation during infection. In addition, our results showed that a fragment consisting of residues 196–413 in MERS-N is sufficient to up-regulate CXCL10, while the N-terminal domain and serine-arginine (SR)-rich motif of MERS-N do not play a role in this up-regulation.","Aboagye, James Odame; Yew, Chow Wenn; Ng, Oi-Wing; Monteil, Vanessa M.; Mirazimi, Ali; Tan, Yee-Joo",Biosci Rep,473,25

Performers and students must now attempt to maintain their technical, physical, artistic, creative, and cognitive abilities without in-person support from their coaches and must manage the isolation from their training and performing spaces. For circus artists, the transposition of the work space to a home environment is not possible, which creates novel stressors that could lead to the exacerbation and escalation of mental health issues. The purpose of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate a holistic interventional program based on the socio-ecological model of resilience and operationalized through physical literacy. This will be a prospective longitudinal study with a retrospective comparison to data from a similar student cohort pre-pandemic. Interventions were designed using a population-specific, participant-based developmental model within a knowledge translation framework. The interventional program includes group webinars, small group information sessions, and one-on-one Zoom meetings, in addition to the distribution of electronic educational materials. The interventions will holistically provide psychological, physical, social, technical, artistic, and creative supports. Resources will be deployed throughout the closure period and through recovery, as transitions to return to training after prolonged hiatus will magnify known psychological and physical difficulties. Repeated, longitudinal assessment of students will be utilized to track changes over time at key transitions in the pandemic and school year and will be compared to a pre-pandemic school year. The framework for this program will be translatable to other performing arts and high-performance contexts.

Whether these glycemic changes are specific to a subgroup of patients and persist following COVID-19 resolution remains to be elucidated. This work aimed to characterize longitudinal random blood glucose in a large cohort of nondiabetic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: De-identified electronic medical records of 7502 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without prior diagnosis of diabetes between January 1, 2020, and November 18, 2020, were accessed through the TriNetX Research Network. Glucose measurements, diagnostic codes, medication codes, laboratory values, vital signs, and demographics were extracted before, during, and after COVID-19 diagnosis. Unsupervised time-series clustering algorithms were trained to identify distinct clusters of glucose trajectories. Cluster associations were tested for demographic variables, COVID-19 severity, glucose-altering medications, glucose values, and new-onset diabetes diagnoses. RESULTS: Time-series clustering identified a low-complexity model with 3 clusters and a high-complexity model with 19 clusters as the best-performing models. In both models, cluster membership differed significantly by death status, COVID-19 severity, and glucose levels. Clusters membership in the 19 cluster model also differed significantly by age, sex, and new-onset diabetes mellitus. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This work identified distinct longitudinal blood glucose changes associated with subclinical glucose dysfunction in the low-complexity model and increased new-onset diabetes incidence in the high-complexity model. Together, these findings highlight the utility of data-driven techniques to elucidate longitudinal glycemic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 and provide clinical evidence for further evaluation of the role of COVID-19 in diabetes pathogenesis.","Mistry, Sejal; Gouripeddi, Ramkiran; Facelli, Julio C; Facelli, Julio C",JAMIA Open,473,1

In the midst of COVID-19 infection, it is extremely important to identify new protein and gene targets that may be highly sensitive diagnostic and prognostic markers of the severity and outcome of the disease for combating this pandemic. Identification of individual genetic predisposition allows personalizing programs of medical rehabilitation and therapy. It has now been shown that the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 infection can be affected by gene variants in both the human body (ACE2, HLA-B*4601, FcγRIIA, MBL, TMPRSS2, TNFA, IL6, blood group A antigen, etc.) and the virus itself (ORF8 in RNA polymerase, ORF6 in RNA primase, S, N, E proteins). The presence of mutations in the proteins of the virus can change the affinity and specificity for the binding of targeted drugs to them, being the molecular basis of individual differences in the response of the human body to antiviral drugs and/or vaccines. The review summarizes the data on the variants of the genomes of the coronavirus and humans associated with an individual predisposition to an increased or decreased risk of transmission, severity, and outcome of COVID-19 infection. Targeted drugs and vaccines being developed for the therapy of COVID-19 infection are briefly reviewed.","Glotov, O. S.; Chernov, A. N.; Scherbak, S. G.; Baranov, V. S.",Russ J Genet,473,16

A bovine TGEV-specific polyclonal antibody was purified by affinity chromatography with the TRIO Bioprocessing System and was used as the capture antibody, at a concentration of 1.5 μg/well. The F5.39 monoclonal antibody was obtained by the fusion of spleen lymphocytes from TGEV immunized mice with NS-1 myeloma cells. This mAb was used as a second antibody for the ELISA to detect TGEV in field cases, 53 intestinal samples were taken from pigs exhibiting clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis. All the positive samples detected by the ELISA were confirmed as positive by immunofluorescence or cell culture immunofluorescence. To study the ability of this ELISA to detect PRCV in nasal swabs and lung samples, 20 seven-day-old piglets were inoculated with a Quebec strain of PRCV. The ELISA was able to detect PRCV in both kinds of samples.","Cornaglia, E.; Chrétien, N.; Charara, S.; Elazhary, Y.",Veterinary Microbiology,473,0

We surveyed 276 community mental health providers registered with a commercial telemedicine platform. Most providers reported primarily offering TMH services to adults with anxiety, depression, and trauma-and stressor-related disorders in individual therapy formats. Approximately 82% of TMH providers reported endorsing the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in their remote practice. The most commonly used in-session and between-session (i.e., homework) exercises included coping and emotion regulation, problem solving, mindfulness, interpersonal skills, relaxation, and modifying and addressing core beliefs. CBT TMH providers had a higher odds of using in-session and homework exercises and assigning them through postal mail, email or fax methods, as compared to non-CBT TMH providers. TMH providers, regardless of treatment paradigm, felt that assigning homework was neither easy nor difficult and they believed their patients were somewhat-to-moderately compliant to their assigned exercises. CBT TMH providers also collected clinical information from their patients more often than non-CBT TMH providers. They reported being less satisfied with their method, which was identified most often as paper-based surveys and forms. Overall, TMH providers employ evidence-based treatments to their patients remotely, with CBT TMH providers most likely to do so. Findings highlight the need for innovative solutions to improve how TMH providers that endorse following the CBT treatment paradigm remotely assign homework and collect clinical data to increase their satisfaction via telemedicine.","Bunnell, Brian E.; Kazantzis, Nikolaos; Paige, Samantha R.; Barrera, Janelle; Thakkar, Rajvi N.; Turner, Dylan; Welch, Brandon M.",Front Psychol,473,6

We investigated whether the specific immune responses in the peripheral blood of 276 patients associated to severity and progression of COVID‐19. At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. Conversely, the proportion of B cells, plasmablasts, circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) and CD56‐CD16+ NK‐cells increased. Regarding humoral immunity, levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected, but when degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients. Compared to healthy donors, complement C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, while the activation peptide of C5 (C5a) increased from the admission in every patient, regardless their severity. Moreover, total IgG, the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier.

This has led to an urgent need to understand the molecular determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection, factors associated with COVID-19 heterogeneity and severity, and therapeutic options for these patients. In this review, we discuss the role of host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe variations in host factor expression as mechanisms underlying the symptoms and severity of COVID-19. We focus on two host factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity revealed in selected patients and based on genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Furthermore, we highlight important advances in cell and chromatin biology, such as single-cell RNA and chromatin sequencing and chromosomal conformation assays, as methods that may aid in the discovery of viral–host interactions in COVID-19. Understanding how regulation of host factor genes varies in physiological and pathological states might explain the heterogeneity observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection, help identify pathways for therapeutic development, and identify patients most likely to progress to severe COVID-19.","Ong, Samantha Y.

No analyses by bibliometric technique that have examined this topic exist in the literature. The objective of this study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of all SARS-related publications in Science Citation Index (SCI) in the early stage. A systematic search was performed using the SCI for publications since SARS outbreak early 2003. Selected documents included 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' or 'SARS' as a part of its title, abstract, or keyword from the beginning stage of SARS outbreak, March till July 8, 2003. Analysis parameters included authorship, patterns of international collaboration, journals, language, document type, research institutional address, times cited, and reprint address. Citation analysis was mainly based on impact factor as defined by Journal Citation Reports(JCR) issued in 2002 and on the actual citation impact (ACI), which has been used to assess the impact relative to the whole field and has been defined as the ratio between individual citation per publication value and the total citation per publication value. Thirty-two percent of total share was published as news features, 25% as editorial materials, 22% as articles, 13% as letters, and the remaining being biographic items, corrections, meeting abstracts, and reprints. The US dominated the production by 30% of the total share followed closely by Hong Kong with 24%. Sixty-three percent of publication was published by the mainstream countries.

Focus on sex as a biologic factor may suggest a potential therapeutic intervention for this disease. We assessed whether adding progesterone to standard of care would improve clinical outcomes of hospitalized men with moderate to severe COVID-19. Research Question Does short-term subcutaneous administration of progesterone safely improve clinical outcome in hypoxemic men hospitalized with COVID-19? Study Design and Methods We conducted a pilot, randomized, open-label, controlled trial of subcutaneous progesterone in men hospitalized with confirmed moderate to severe COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard of care (SOC) plus progesterone (100 mg subcutaneously twice daily for up to five days) or SOC alone. In addition to assessment of safety, the primary outcome was change in clinical status at day 7. Length of hospital stay and number of days on supplemental oxygen were key secondary outcomes. Results Forty-two patients were enrolled from April - August 2020; 22 were randomized to the control group and 20 to the progesterone group. Two patients from the progesterone group withdrew from the study prior to receiving progesterone. There was a 1.5-point overall improvement in median clinical status score on a seven-point ordinal scale from baseline to Day 7 in patients in the progesterone group as compared to controls (95%CI:0.0-2.0; P=0.024). There were no serious adverse events attributable to progesterone. Patients treated with progesterone required 3 fewer days of supplemental oxygen (median of 4.5 vs 7.5 days) and were hospitalized for 2.5 fewer days (median of 7.0 vs 9.5 days) as compared to controls.

This calls for a rapid screening strategy of SARS-CoV-2 protective antibodies generated in rehabilitators and vaccinated populations. Methods Serum samples collected over a follow-up period of 6 months from 306 COVID-19 cases discharged from Wuhan Tongji Hospital were analyzed. Anti-S Abs were detected by colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA) and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were detected by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). Results Most COVID-19 survivors tested positive for anti-S Abs (83.7%) and nAbs (98.0%) 6 months after being discharged from the hospital, and the levels of anti-S Abs in the blood were highly positively correlated with nAbs (r = 0.652, P < 0.0001). The positivity rate of nAbs for patients with anti-S Abs positive was 100%. Conclusions There is a good agreement between anti-S Abs detected by GICA and nAbs detected by CMIA. It indicates that anti-S Abs detected by GICA may be used as a cheaper screening strategy for detectable SARS-CoV-2 nAbs in COVID-19 convalescent individuals.","Li, Xinjie; Yin, Yue; Pang, Ling; Xu, Shuyun; Lu, Fengmin; Xu, Dong; Shen, Tao",Int J Infect Dis,473,1

We measured levels of total lymphocytes, CD3(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells, and CD56(+) NK cells and the serum concentrations of interleukin- (IL-) 1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) by flow cytometry. We found that in most postrecovery patients, levels of total lymphocytes (66.67%), CD3(+) T cells (54.55%), CD4(+) T cells (54.55%), CD8(+) T cells (81.82%), CD19(+) B cells (69.70%), and CD56(+) NK cells (51.52%) remained lower than normal, whereas most patients showed normal levels of IL-2 (100%), IL-4 (80.88%), IL-6 (79.41%), IL-10 (98.53%), TNF-α (89.71%), IFN-γ (100%), and IL-17 (97.06%). Compared to healthy controls, two-week postrecovery patients had significantly lower absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD19(+) B cells, and CD56(+) NK cells, along with significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17. Among postrecovery patients, T cells, particularly CD4(+) T cells, were positively correlated with CD19(+) B cell counts. Additionally, CD8(+) T cells were positively correlated with CD4(+) T cells and IL-2 levels, and IL-6 positively correlated with TNF-α and IFN-γ. These correlations were not observed in healthy controls. By ROC curve analysis, postrecovery decreases in lymphocyte subsets and increases in cytokines were identified as independent predictors of rehabilitation efficacy. These findings indicate that the immune system gradually recovers following COVID-19 infection; however, the sustained hyperinflammatory response for more than 14 days suggests a need to continue medical observation following discharge from the hospital. Longitudinal studies of a larger cohort of recovered patients are needed to fully understand the consequences of the infection.","Hasichaolu,; Zhang, Xinri; Li, Xin; Li, Xin; Li, Dongyan",Biomed Res Int,473,1

The dynamics of the droplets is governed by the Maxey–Riley equation with the Basset–Boussinesq history term neglected. We find that, in the absence of gravity, there are two distinct behaviors for the droplets: small droplets cannot go further than a specific distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting pulled into the sink. Larger droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their maximum traveled distance is determined analytically. We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviors categorized by their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with a minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range in size from a few μm to a few hundred μm. The result that such droplets have a very short range could have important implications for the interpretation of existing data on droplet dispersion.","Cummins, C. P.; Ajayi, O. J.; Mehendale, F.

Here, we present a stochastic model that examines this problem. In our model, people are allowed to move between discrete positions on a one-dimensional grid with viral infection possible when two people are collocated at the same site. Our model features three sets of adjustable parameters, which characterize (i) viral transmission, (ii) viral detection, and (iii) degree of personal mobility, and as such, it is able to provide a qualitative assessment of the potential for second-wave infection outbreaks based on the timing, extent, and pattern of the lockdown relaxation strategies. Our results suggest that a full lockdown will yield the lowest number of infections (as anticipated) but we also found that when personal mobility exceeded a critical level, infections increased, quickly reaching a plateau that depended solely on the population density. Confinement was not effective if not accompanied by a detection/quarantine capacity surpassing 40% of the symptomatic patients. Finally, taking action to ensure a viral transmission probability of less than 0.4, which, in real life, may mean actions such as social distancing or mask-wearing, could be as effective as a soft lockdown.","Ando, Shiho; Matsuzawa, Yuki; Tsurui, Hiromichi; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Hall, Damien; Kuroda, Yutaka",Sci Rep,473,24

We conducted an online survey focused on peoples’ relationships with the non-human world during the pandemic and received valid responses from 3,204 adult residents of the state of Vermont (U.S.A.). We analyzed reported changes in outdoor activities and the values associated with human-nature relationships across geographic areas and demographic characteristics. We find that participation increased on average for some activities (foraging, gardening, hiking, jogging, photography and other art, relaxing alone, walking, and watching wildlife), and decreased for others (camping, relaxing with others). The values respondents ranked as more important during the pandemic factored into two groups, which we label as “Nurture and Recreation values” and “Inspiration and Nourishment values.” Using multinomial logistic regression, we found that respondents’ preferences for changes in activity engagement and value factors are statistically associated with some demographic characteristics, including geography, gender, income, and employment status during the pandemic. Our results suggest that nature may play an important role in coping during times of crisis, but that the specific interactions and associated values that people perceive as most important may vary between populations. Our findings emphasize for both emergency and natural resources planning the importance of understanding variation in how and why people interact with and benefit from nature during crises.","Morse, Joshua W.; Gladkikh, Tatiana M.; Hackenburg, Diana M.; Gould, Rachelle K.",PLoS One,473,1

These AMPs target EBOV infection at the endosomal cell-entry step by impairing cathepsin B-mediated processing of EBOV GP. Furthermore, two engineered AMPs containing D-amino acids are particularly potent in blocking EBOV infection in comparison with other AMPs, most likely owing to their resistance to intracellular enzymatic degradation. Our results identify AMPs as a novel class of anti-EBOV therapeutics and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering AMPs for improved therapeutic efficacy.","Yu, Yangsheng; Cooper, Christopher L.; Wang, Guangshun; Morwitzer, M.

Several recent scientific studies have shown that medicinal plants and vitamins can benefit and improve the health of COVID-19 patients. However, the benefits of medicinal plants and vitamins in the treatment of COVID-19 remain unproven. Therefore, the objective of this article is to expounds the benefits of using medicinal plants (Allium sativum, curcumin, Nigella sativa, Zingiber officitale) and vitamins (vitamin C and vitamin D) that possess the antiviral properties for the prevention and/or control of COVID-19. To reach our objective, we searched scientific databases of ongoing trials in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites, PubMed Central, Medline databases, and Google Scholar websites. We also searched databases on World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to collect relevant papers. We found that all of the selected medicinal plants and vitamins possess antiviral activities, and their individual intake shows promise for the prevention and/or control of COVID-19.

We have also evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on our Kidney Transplant (KT) Recipients and a control group of Kidney Living Donors (KLD). in the survey demonstrated excellent awareness of the NPI. In our series there were zero cases of COVID-19 among 111 KT recipients and 70 KLD of the control group. Demography, transplant type, immunosuppression regimes and, as importantly, the different COVID-19 prevalence in the two regions of the TxC, did not appear to influence incidence of COVID-19 in our KT recipients. The absence of COVID-19 cases in our series was unexpected. Our findings suggest that awareness of NPI is associated with a successful containment of COVID-19 in vulnerable, immunosuppressed KT recipients.","Monaco, Andrea; Manzia, Tommaso Maria; Angelico, Roberta; Iaria, Giuseppe; Gazia, Carlo; Al Alawi, Yousef; Fourtounas, Konstantinos; Tisone, Giuseppe; Cacciola, Roberto",Transplant Proc,473,17

People are, however, different from one another in terms of interaction frequency as well as in formation of social groups. This contact heterogeneity especially challenges models of contact tracing (CT), but also predictions of epidemic severity generally. We explore how heterogeneity affects CT effectiveness and overall epidemic severity, using a real-world contact network. Methods: Utilizing smartphone proximity data from Danish university students, we simulate the spread of COVID-19 on a network with realistic contact structure. Two modes of network homogenization are implemented to probe effects of heterogeneity. We then simulate a CT scheme on the network and explore the impact of heterogeneity, testing probability and contact threshold for quarantining. Results: Measuring contact heterogeneity, we find an exponential distribution which persists on a timescale of several weeks. Comparing the true network to edge-swapped and randomized versions, we find that heterogeneity decreases the severity of COVID-19 in general, and that it drastically improves CT. Conclusions: To capture heterogeneity, it is necessary to reconsider disease transmission models. Our findings show that heterogeneity is essential for CT, and that CT is effective even if only the most frequent contacts can be tracked down. We find that contact heterogeneity impedes the spread of COVID-19 in comparison with well-mixed networks. In perspective, this means that fitting traditional SEIR models to epidemic data is likely to overestimate the severity.","Nielsen, B. F.; Sneppen, K.; Simonsen, L.; Mathiesen, J.",,473,28

However, LEO face significant on-the-job stressors that undermine mental health, and there is a lot to be learned about when and how LEO seek and enter mental health services. The present study sought to explore variables related to mental health seeking behavior, the role of social engagement and social pressure in the decision to seek mental health services, and the most common pathways into mental health utilized by LEO. A small sample of 86 LEO were recruited from the social media page of a law enforcement nonprofit support organization to take several self-report measures on past mental health service usage and intentions to seek future services, the Inventory of Attitudes Toward Seeking Mental Health Services, the Professional Quality of Life Survey, and a measure of social engagement on mental health topics. Results indicate that while a number of factors are associated with intentions to seek future services, the primary factor in past mental health seeking behavior was secondary traumatic stress. Those who sought mental health services reported higher social engagement and social pressure to seek help. LEO entered mental health services for a variety of reasons and through a variety of provider options, such that no one provider source was preferred. Though the present study was limited by a small sample size, reliance on self-report measures, and occurred during a time of civil unrest that sparked the “defund the police” movement, the results serve as a starting point for understanding the pathways into mental health services for LEO and the roles of secondary trauma and prior mental health service experience.","Daniel, Alan M.; Treece, Kelly S.",J Police Crim Psychol,473,1

Understanding the context in which transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), occurs in schools is critical to improving the safety of in-person learning. During December 1, 2020-January 22, 2021, Cobb and Douglas Public Health (CDPH), the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH), and CDC investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in eight public elementary schools in a single school district. COVID-19 cases* among educators and students were either self-reported or identified by local public health officials. Close contacts (contacts)† of persons with a COVID-19 case received testing. Among contacts who received positive test results, public health investigators assessed epidemiologic links, probable transmission directionality, and the likelihood of in-school transmission.§ Nine clusters of three or more epidemiologically linked COVID-19 cases were identified involving 13 educators and 32 students at six of the eight elementary schools. Two clusters involved probable educator-to-educator transmission that was followed by educator-to-student transmission and resulted in approximately one half (15 of 31) of school-associated cases. Sixty-nine household members of persons with school-associated cases were tested, and 18 (26%) received positive results. All nine transmission clusters involved less than ideal physical distancing, and five involved inadequate mask use by students. Educators were central to in-school transmission networks. Multifaceted mitigation measures in schools, including promotion of COVID-19 precautions outside of school, minimizing in-person adult interactions at school, and ensuring universal and correct mask use and physical distancing among educators and students when in-person interaction is unavoidable, are important in preventing in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Although not required for reopening schools, COVID-19 vaccination should be considered as an additional mitigation measure to be added when available.","Gold, Jeremy A.

Vaccines can play a key role in preventing harm, but there will inevitably be shortages because there is no possibility of advance stockpiling. We therefore need some method of prioritising access. MAIN TEXT: This paper reports a critical interpretative review of the published literature that discusses ethical arguments used to justify how we could prioritise vaccine during an influenza pandemic. We found that the focus of the literature was often on proposing different groups as priorities (e.g. those with pre-existing health conditions, the young, the old, health care workers etc.). Different reasons were often suggested as a means of justifying such priority groupings (e.g. appeal to best overall outcomes, fairness, belonging to a vulnerable or ‘at risk’ group etc.). We suggest that much of the literature, wrongly, assumes that we are able to plan priority groups prior to the time of a particular pandemic and development of a particular vaccine. We also point out the surprising absence of various issues from the literature (e.g. how vaccines fit within overall pandemic planning, a lack of specificity about place, issues of global justice etc.). CONCLUSIONS: The literature proposes a wide range of ways to prioritise vaccines, focusing on different groups and ‘principles’. Any plan to use pandemic vaccine must provide justifications for its prioritisation. The focus of this review was influenza pandemic vaccines, but lessons can be learnt for future allocations of coronavirus vaccine, if one becomes available.","Williams, Jane H.; Dawson, Angus",BMC Med Ethics,473,16

Here we show that supervised, sensitive database searches with Orf3a detect weak, yet significant and highly specific similarities to the M proteins of coronaviruses. The similarity profiles can be used to derive low-resolution three-dimensional models for M proteins based on Orf3a as a structural template. The models also explain the emergence of Orf3a from M proteins and suggest a recent origin across the coronavirus lineage, enunciated by its restricted phylogenetic distribution. This study provides evidence for the common origin of M and Orf3a families and proposes for the first time a working model for the structure of the universally distributed M proteins in coronaviruses, consistent with the properties of both protein families.","Ouzounis, Christos A.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,473,5

In the present study, we report the essential role of a novel protein, P. falciparum Merozoite Surface Antigen 180 (PfMSA180), which is conserved across Plasmodium species and recently shown to be associated with the P. vivax merozoite surface. Here, we studied MSA180 expression, processing, localization and function in P. falciparum blood stages. Initially we examined its role in invasion, a process mediated by multiple ligand-receptor interactions and an attractive step for targeting with inhibitory antibodies through the development of a malaria vaccine. Using antibodies specific for different regions of PfMSA180, together with a parasite containing a conditional pfmsa180-gene knockout generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and DiCre recombinase technology, we demonstrate that this protein is unlikely to play a crucial role in erythrocyte invasion. However, deletion of the pfmsa180 gene resulted in a severe egress defect, preventing schizont rupture and blocking the erythrocytic cycle. Our study highlights an essential role of PfMSA180 in parasite egress, which could be targeted through the development of a novel malaria intervention strategy.","Bahl, Vanndita; Chaddha, Kritika; Mian, Syed Yusuf; Holder, Anthony A.; Knuepfer, Ellen; Gaur, Deepak",Sci Rep,473,1

An online questionnaire survey was conducted to explore the influence of demographic characteristics, individual awareness, social relationship, risk disclosure, perceived vaccine efficacy, and protection duration under the assumptions of information framing. The results showed that (1) the persuasion effect under loss frame was higher than that under gain frame (B = 0.616 vs. 0.552); (2) there was no significant difference between sex, age, income, occupation, educational background and residence for the participants’ intention to be vaccinated; whether family members/friends were vaccinated had a strong correlation with their vaccination intention under the gain frame; (3) the higher the understanding of COVID-19 and the compliance with government COVID-19 prevention and control measures were, the higher the vaccination intention was; (4) risk disclosure had the greatest impact on people‘s COVID-19 vaccination intention; (5) perceived vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection had little effect on people’s intention to receive vaccination. The influence of information framing on the intention of COVID-19 vaccination is different.

However, the limited vaccine capacity creates another massive challenge: how to distribute vaccines to mitigate the near‐end impact of the pandemic? In the United States in particular, the new Biden administration is launching mass vaccination sites across the country, raising the obvious question of where to locate these clinics to maximize the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign. This paper tackles this question with a novel data‐driven approach to optimize COVID‐19 vaccine distribution. We first augment a state‐of‐the‐art epidemiological model, called DELPHI, to capture the effects of vaccinations and the variability in mortality rates across age groups. We then integrate this predictive model into a prescriptive model to optimize the location of vaccination sites and subsequent vaccine allocation. The model is formulated as a bilinear, nonconvex optimization model. To solve it, we propose a coordinate descent algorithm that iterates between optimizing vaccine distribution and simulating the dynamics of the pandemic. As compared to benchmarks based on demographic and epidemiological information, the proposed optimization approach increases the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign by an estimated 20%, saving an extra 4000 extra lives in the United States over a 3‐month period. The proposed solution achieves critical fairness objectives—by reducing the death toll of the pandemic in several states without hurting others—and is highly robust to uncertainties and forecast errors—by achieving similar benefits under a vast range of perturbations.","Bertsimas, Dimitris; Digalakis Jr, Vassilis; Jacquillat, Alexander; Li, Michael Lingzhi; Previero, Alessandro",,473,12

METHODS: This nationwide case-control and cohort study included all individuals in Denmark tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA with PCR from 27 February 2020 to 26 July 2020. We estimated confounder-adjusted ORs for a positive test among all SARS-CoV-2 tested, and inverse probability of treatment weighted 30-day risk and risk ratios (RRs) of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality comparing current ACE-I/ARB use with calcium channel blocker (CCB) use and with non-use. RESULTS: The study included 13 501 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and 1 088 695 PCR-negative individuals. Users of ACE-I/ARB had a marginally increased rate of a positive PCR when compared with CCB users (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37), but not when compared with non-users (aOR 1.00 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09). Among PCR-positive individuals, 1466 (11%) were ACE-I/ARB users. The weighted risk of hospitalisation was 36.5% in ACE-I/ARB users and 43.3% in CCB users (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02). The risk of ICU admission was 6.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 5.4% in CCB users (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.16), while the 30-day mortality was 12.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 13.9% in CCB users (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.30). The associations were similar when ACE-I/ARB users were compared with non-users. CONCLUSIONS: ACE-I/ARB use was associated neither with a consistently increased rate nor with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings support the current recommendation of continuing use of ACE-Is/ARBs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Individuals with rare disorders, like Down syndrome (DS) are historically understudied. Currently, it is not known how COVID-19 pandemic affects individuals with DS. Herein, we report an analysis of individuals with DS who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, USA. Methods. In this retrospective, single-center study of 4,615 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we analyzed all patients with DS admitted in the Mount Sinai Health System. Hospitalization rates, clinical and outcomes were assessed. Findings. Contrary to an expected number of one, we identified six patients with DS. We found that patients with DS are at an 8.9-fold higher risk of hospitalization with COVID-19 when compared to non-DS patients. Hospitalized DS individuals are on average 10 years younger than non-DS patients with COVID-19. Moreover, type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to be an important driver of this susceptibility to COVID-19. Finally, patients with DS have more severe outcomes than controls, and are more likely to progress to sepsis in particular. Interpretation. We demonstrate that individuals with DS represent a higher risk population for COVID-19 compared to the general population and conclude that particular care should be taken for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in these patients.

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by reducing the density in the classroom, the Japanese government has decided to reduce the upper-limit of class size in primary schools after 2021, which is expected to result in lowering the student-teacher ratio. The aim of this study was to examine the association between student-teacher ratio, teacher work hours and teacher stress. METHODS: Data on student-teacher ratio, teacher work hours, and teacher stress were obtained from a large-scale international survey conducted by OECD. The number of teachers participated in the survey was 3308 (primary school) and 3555 (lower-secondary school). After excluding teachers with missing observations, the analytic sample consisted of 2761 (primary school) and 3006 (lower-secondary school) teachers. Multivariate regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Regression results revealed that student-teacher ratio was positively correlated with total work hours and workload stress of teachers. In particular, teachers working in schools with high student-teacher ratio spent more time on time-consuming tasks such as marking/correcting student work and communication with parents or guardians. The coefficient estimates suggested that, on average, lowering the student-teacher ratio by five in lower-secondary school was associated with 2.8 hours shorter working hours per week (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our empirical results suggested that the class-size reduction policy starting in 2021 could reduce teacher stress and long work hours through the consequent decrease in student-teacher ratios.","Hojo, Masakazu",BMC Public Health,473,16

METHODS: This study includes 46 patients of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic (23 with confirmed infection, 23 controls with later on excluded infection), who were initially admitted to the Covid Decision Unit of an academic teaching hospital under the clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients were examined by pulmonary ultrasound shortly after admission. The final diagnosis of infection was made or ruled out by means of - sometimes repeated - PCR of nasal/pharyngeal swabs.Findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls were compared and analyzed for significant differences in chest sonographic parameters. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the lung ultrasound findings of both groups. In the Covid group there were significantly fewer A-lines, more pathological B-lines (increased or confluent) and more consolidations. Pleural effusions were significantly more frequent in the control group. The calculated lung ultrasound score (LUS) was higher in the Covid group than in the control group.

Results from a national survey,18.29843,4.837869,2020-09-15,"Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results demonstrate that cotranslational folding of this protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding and/ or binding events may also stimulate PRF.","Harrington, Haley R.; Zimmer, Matthew H.; Chamness, Laura M.; Nash, Veronica; Penn, Wesley D.; Miller, Thomas F.; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana; Schlebach, Jonathan P.",bioRxiv,473,16

Many developing countries, however, have limited capacities to estimate R accurately. This study aims to demonstrate how health production function can be used to assess the state of COVID-19 transmission and to determine a risk-based relaxation policy. METHODS: The author employs a simple “bridge” between epidemiological models and production economics to establish the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases as a short-run total product function and to derive the corresponding marginal product, average product, and production elasticity. Three crucial dates defining the states of transmission, labelled red, yellow, and green zones, are determined. Relaxation policy is illogical in the “red zone” and is not recommended in the “yellow zone”. In the “green zone”, relaxation can be considered. The Bayesian probability of near term’s daily cases meeting a policy target is computed. The method is applied to France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US, and to Indonesia as an example of application in developing countries. RESULTS: This study uses data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, beginning from the first recording date for each country until February 28, 2021. As of June 30, 2020, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK had arrived at the “green zone” but with a high risk of transmission re-escalations. In the following weeks, their production elasticities were rising, giving a signal of accelerated transmissions. The signal was corroborated by these countries’ rising cases, making them leaving the “green zone” in the later months. By February 28, 2021, the UK had returned to the “green zone”, France, Germany, and Italy were still in the “yellow zone”, while the US reached the “green zone” at a very high number of cases. Despite being in the “red zone”, Indonesia relaxed its distancing measures, causing a sharp rise of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Health production function can show the state of COVID-19 transmission. A rising production elasticity gives an early warning of transmission escalations. The elasticity is a useful parameter for risk-based relaxation policy.

When viruses jump into a new species the outcome of infection ranges from asymptomatic to lethal, historically ascribed to “genetic resistance to viral disease.” People have exploited these differences for good and bad, for developing vaccines from cowpox and horsepox virus, controlling rabbit plagues with myxoma virus and introducing smallpox during colonization of America and Australia. Differences in resistance to viral disease are at the core of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) crisis, yet our understanding of the mechanisms in any interspecies leap falls short of the mark. Here I review how the two key parameters of viral disease are countered by fundamentally different genetic mechanisms for resistance: (1) virus transmission, countered primarily by activation of innate and adaptive immune responses; and (2) pathology, countered primarily by tolerance checkpoints to limit innate and adaptive immune responses. I discuss tolerance thresholds and the role of CD8 T cells to limit pathological immune responses, the problems posed by tolerant superspreaders and the signature coronavirus evasion strategy of eliciting only short‐lived neutralizing antibody responses. Pinpointing and targeting the mechanisms responsible for varying pathology and short‐lived antibody were beyond reach in previous zoonoses, but this time we are armed with genomic technologies and more knowledge of immune checkpoint genes.

ORF9b(40-48) (CD8+ T-cell epitope) is found to be highly immunogenic and antigenic with the highest allele coverage. Furthermore, it has overlap with four potent CD4+ T-cell epitopes. Structure-based B-cell epitope prediction has identified ORF9b(61-68) to be immunodominant, which partially overlaps with one of the linear B-cell epitopes (ORF9b(65-69)). ORF3c CD4+ T-cell epitopes (ORF3c(2-16), ORF3c(3-17), and ORF3c(4-18)) and linear B-cell epitope (ORF3c(14-22)) have also been identified as the candidate epitopes. Similarly, M.ext and 7a.iORF1 (overlap with M and ORF7a) proteins have promising immunogenic regions. By considering the level of antigen expression, four ORF9b and five M.ext epitopes are finally shortlisted as potent epitopes. Mutation analysis has further revealed that the shortlisted potent uORF epitopes are resistant to recurrent mutations. Additionally, four N-protein (expressed by canonical ORF) epitopes are found to be potent. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 uORF B-cell and T-cell epitopes identified here along with canonical ORF epitopes may aid in the design of a promising epitope-based polyvalent vaccine (when connected through appropriate linkers) against SARS-CoV-2. Such a vaccine can act as a bulwark against SARS-CoV-2, especially in the scenario of emergence of variants with recurring mutations in the spike protein.","Uttamrao, Patil Pranita; Sathyaseelan, Chakkarai; Patro, L.

We aimed to develop a national consensus management pathway for the UK to provide guidance for clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS. A three-phase online Delphi process and virtual consensus meeting sought consensus over the investigation, management, and research priorities from multidisciplinary clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS. We used 140 consensus statements to derive a consensus management pathway that describes the initial investigation of children with suspected PIMS-TS, including blood markers to help determine the severity of disease, an echocardiogram, and a viral and septic screen to exclude other infectious causes of illness. The importance of a multidisciplinary team in decision making for children with PIMS-TS is highlighted throughout the guidance, along with the recommended treatment options, including supportive care, intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and biological therapies. These include IL-1 antagonists (eg, anakinra), IL-6 receptor blockers (eg, tocilizumab), and anti-TNF agents (eg, infliximab) for children with Kawasaki disease-like phenotype and non-specific presentations. Use of a rapid online Delphi process has made it possible to generate a national consensus pathway in a timely and cost-efficient manner in the middle of a global pandemic. The consensus statements represent the views of UK clinicians and are applicable to children in the UK suspected of having PIMS-TS. Future evidence will inform updates to this guidance, which in the interim provides a solid framework to support clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS. This process has directly informed new PIMS-TS specific treatment groups as part of the adaptive UK RECOVERY trial protocol, which is the first formal randomised controlled trial of therapies for PIMS-TS globally.","Harwood, Rachel; Allin, Benjamin; Jones, Christine E; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Ramanan, Athimalaipet V; Kaleem, Musa; Tulloh, Robert; Peters, Mark J; Almond, Sarah; Davis, Peter J; Levin, Michael; Tometzki, Andrew; Faust, Saul N; Knight, Marian; Kenny, Simon",Lancet Child Adolesc Health,473,26

A 39-year-old immunocompetent Indian man developed severe pneumonia, and his condition became life-threatening despite antimicrobial therapy. While sputum and blood cultures remained negative, a multiplex PCR respiratory panel (Filmarray Respiratory Panel), which is only approved for use with nasopharyngeal samples, detected HAdV in the serum and tracheal aspirates on day 5. We therefore initiated ganciclovir, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient’s respiratory condition improved significantly, and he eventually recovered without complications. We later confirmed that conventional PCR of serum detected HAdV-B7. Our case illustrated that a respiratory panel using multiplex PCR successfully detected HAdV in unapproved samples. Such off-label analyses may support the early diagnosis of infections caused by pathogens that are difficult to identify by routine microbiological examination.","Sakakura, Akie; Akashi, Yusaku; Shiigai, Masanari; Isono, Hiroki; Suzuki, Hiromichi; Hirose, Yumi",IDCases,473,1

For GPFSSs, the distance measures such as Hamming, Euclidean, and generalized are given. Further, the basic characteristics of these distance measures are examined. Fuzzy and soft sets are strong instruments for uncertainty. This strongness has been demonstrated by the GPFSS combining Pythagorean fuzzy sets and soft sets and applied to imprecise and ambiguous information. In this context, new remoteness index-based methods have been proposed, which are dissimilar from available VIKOR methods. The displaced and fixed ideals positive and negative Pythagorean fuzzy values (PFV) were defined. Thus, based on this definition, displaced positive ideal remoteness indices, negative ideal remoteness indices, and fixed positive ideal, negative ideal remoteness indices were discussed. Two different weights are used here: weights based on OF preference information and precise weights calculated with the expectation score function. The VIKOR method given here provides a different way from canonical VIKOR methods: rank candidate alternatives and determining a compromise solution based on different preference structures. The processes principles of the newly defined GPFSSs VIKOR methods are given by four algorithms. An example of these algorithms is given with the behavioral development and cognitive development of the children of Early Childhood children in the COVID-19 quarantine.","Kirişci, Murat; Demir, İbrahim; Şimşek, Necip; Topaç, Nihat; Bardak, Musa",Neural Comput Appl,473,15

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections, but might also contribute to immune pathology. Here, using 28-color flow cytometry, we describe a state of strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a pattern mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of lung NK cells. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis identified distinct immunophenotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunophenotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting a high presence of adaptive NK cell expansions in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed in course of COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors.

On August 25, 2021, the authors informed MMWR that some analyses were inaccurate because vaccination records of persons with a birth date between two vaccination dates could be counted as two distinct persons with different ages. This resulted in an artificial inflation of the population of partially vaccinated persons, which in turn affected the number of unvaccinated persons because that number is estimated as the total population size minus the fully vaccinated and the partially vaccinated groups. Programming code was adjusted to address this issue as well as three uncommon issues that had a relatively minor impact on findings. First, unvaccinated persons who received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 who subsequently received a first vaccination dose were not always counted towards the tally of unvaccinated COVID-19 cases. Second, persons who received additional doses before such doses were authorized had their date of full vaccination assigned based on final dose date, rather than series completion date. Third, persons who received doses in both New York City and the other areas of New York required additional deduplication. Using current data from the continuously updated surveillance databases, the authors have corrected the MMWR report accordingly and confirmed that the interpretation and the conclusions of the original report were not affected by these changes (the updated results are highly similar to those of the primary analysis and sensitivity analyses as reported in the original paper).

Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein with the host cell receptor is recognized as the first step of infection and is the main determinant of virus tropism. The mechanisms by which neutralizing antibodies inhibit PEDV have not been defined. Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies are crucial to identifying the receptor-binding domains of the viral spike and elucidating the mechanism of protection against PEDV infection. METHODS: B cell hybridoma technique was used to generate hybridoma cells that secrete specific antibodies. E.coli prokaryotic expression system and Bac-to-Bac expression system were used to identify the target protein of each monoclonal antibody. qPCR was performed to analyze PEDV binding to Vero E6 cells with neutralizing antibody. RESULTS: We identified 10 monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. Remarkably, 4 mAbs (designed 2G8, 2B11, 3D9, 1E3) neutralized virus infection potently, of which 2B11 and 1E3 targeted the conformational epitope of the PEDV S protein. qPCR results showed that both 2B11 and 2G8 blocked virus entry into Vero cells. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that PEDV neutralizing antibody inhibited virus infection by binding to infectious virions, which could work as a tool to find the receptor-binding domains.

The results proved a relationship between Covid stress, performance and EI, which has a moderating effect between the stress and both indicators of performance, even when sociodemographic variables were controlled. In essence, professionals with high levels of EI and low Covid stress showed the highest performance and the lowest CWB when compared to those who presented less emotional capabilities and higher stress.

However, the effect of heterotypic co-infections on IBV replication was not investigated. To do so, we produced by reverse genetics a pair of replication-competent recombinant IAV (A/WSN/33) and IBV (B/Brisbane/60/2008) expressing a GFP and mCherry fluorescent reporter, respectively. A549 cells were infected simultaneously or 1 h apart at a high MOI with IAV-GFP or IBV-mCherry and the fluorescence was measured at 6 h post-infection by flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, we observed that IBV-mCherry infection was enhanced upon co-infection with IAV-GFP, and more strongly so when IAV was added 1 h prior to IBV. The same effect was observed with wild-type viruses and with various strains of IAV. Using UV-inactivated IAV or type-specific antiviral compounds, we showed that the enhancing effect of IAV infection on IBV infection was dependent on transcription/replication of the IAV genome. Our results, taken with available data in the literature, support the hypothesis that the presence of IAV proteins can enhance IBV genome expression and/or complement IBV defective particles.","Malausse, Nicolas; van der Werf, Sylvie; Naffakh, Nadia; Munier, Sandie",Front Microbiol,473,29

Public debates question its impact ompared with reliance on individual responsibility. We aim at understanding how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics. We want to, first, assess the value of lockdown compared to a counterfactual that incorporates self-protection efforts under unknown disease prevalence; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when mandatory policies are relaxed. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions, and the value of contacts. In a Nash equilibrium, individual uncoordinated efforts yield average contact intensity, which drives epidemic transmission. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to reported cases in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that the number of deaths with no lockdown but equilibrium efforts is only 1/6 to 1/10 of the number predicted with business-as-usual. However, lockdown saves at least 50% more lives than individual efforts alone. Prolonged weaker restrictions prevent an exponential rebound. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts. Compulsory mask wearing helps resume activity but has no impact on the epidemic. Communication that increases risk salience is more effective.","Aubert, C.; Augeraud-Veron, E.",,473,1

However, antibiotics are prescribed frequently for children with ARI, often in absence of evidence for bacterial infection. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions for mild ARI in paediatric outpatients in relation to available guidelines and detected pathogens, 2) to assess antibiotic use on presentation using questionnaires and detection in urine 3) to assess the carriage rates and proportions of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae before, during and after consultation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were prospectively enrolled in Children’s Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and diagnoses, prescribed therapy and outcome were recorded on first visit and on follow-up after 7 days. Respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens were detected using molecular assays. Antibiotic use before presentation was assessed using questionnaires and urine HPLC. The impact of antibiotic usage on intestinal Enterobacteriaceae was assessed with semi-quantitative culture on agar with and without antibiotics on presentation and after 7 and 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 563 patients were enrolled between February 2009 and February 2010. Antibiotics were prescribed for all except 2 of 563 patients. The majority were 2(nd) and 3(rd) generation oral cephalosporins and amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid. Respiratory viruses were detected in respiratory specimens of 72.5% of patients. Antibiotic use was considered inappropriate in 90.1% and 67.5%, based on guidelines and detected pathogens, respectively. On presentation parents reported antibiotic use for 22% of patients, 41% of parents did not know and 37% denied antibiotic use. Among these three groups, six commonly used antibiotics were detected with HPLC in patients’ urine in 49%, 40% and 14%, respectively. Temporary selection of 3(rd) generation cephalosporin resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae during antibiotic use was observed, with co-selection of resistance to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: We report overuse and overprescription of antibiotics for uncomplicated ARI with selection of resistant intestinal Enterobacteriaceae, posing a risk for community transmission and persistence in a setting of a highly granular healthcare system and unrestricted access to antibiotics through private pharmacies.

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ( ± 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.

Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister’s announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility. Conclusions: These analyses form a baseline from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK.","Jeffrey, Benjamin; Walters, Caroline E.; Ainslie, Kylie E.

Among them, rotaviruses are one of the most important causes of diarrhea in young animals and human infants. A lack of understanding of mechanisms to induce intestinal immunity and the correlates of protective immunity in neonates has impaired development of safe and effective vaccines against enteric viruses. Studies of candidate vaccines using an adult mouse model of subclinical enteric viral infections often do not predict vaccine efficacy against disease evaluated in neonatal large animals. A series of studies have been conducted using a neonatal gnotobiotic pig model of rotavirus infection and diarrhea to identify correlates of protective immunity and to evaluate traditional and novel vaccine approaches for the induction of mucosal immune responses and protection to enteric viruses. Gnotobiotic pigs recovered from infection with virulent Wa human rotavirus (HRV) (mimic natural infection) had high numbers of intestinal IgA rotavirus-specific primary antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and memory B-cells (to recall antigen) measured by ELISPOT assay, which correlated with complete protection against rotavirus challenge. Most short-term IgA memory B-cells were resident in the ileum, the major site of rotavirus replication. Spleen, not the bone marrow, was the major resident site for longer-term IgG memory B-cells. Candidate rotavirus vaccines evaluated in pigs for their ability to induce intestinal or systemic ASC and protection against rotavirus infection and diarrhea included attenuated live virus, inactivated virus, and baculovirus-expressed double-layered rotavirus-like particles (2/6-VLPs). In combination with those candidate vaccines, various adjuvants, delivery systems, and immunization routes were tested, including incomplete Freund’s adjuvant for i.m. immunization, and a mutant Escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin R192G (mLT) for i.n. immunization. It was shown that orally administered replicating vaccines were most effective for priming for intestinal IgA ASC and memory B-cell responses, but i.n. administered non-replicating 2/6-VLPs plus mLT were effective as booster vaccines. We conclude that protective immunity depends on the magnitude, location, viral protein-specificity, and isotype of the antibody responses induced by vaccination. Therefore highly effective enteric viral vaccines should: (i) induce sufficient levels of intestinal IgA antibodies; (ii) include viral antigens that induce neutralizing antibodies; and (iii) require the use of effective mucosal adjuvants or antigen delivery systems for non-replicating oral or i.n. vaccines.","Yuan, Lijuan; Saif, Linda J",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,473,20

We explored changes in children’s daily life and effects on their mental health during school closures. METHODS: Participants included elementary and junior high school students 9 years of age and older seen in the outpatient clinic during school closures and were required to complete the Japanese version of WHO Five Well‐Being Index (WHO‐5‐J). The results were compared with those of students seen after schools reopened. RESULTS: Participants included 78 students in the school closure group and 113 in the school reopening group. Although those in the closure group devoted more time to family and sleep, their sleep rhythms, eating habits, and physical activities were disrupted. Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in total WHO‐5‐J scores, single WHO‐5‐J items such as activity and vigor and interest were significantly worse and rest was significantly better in the school closure group. CONCLUSION: Although school closures resulted in elementary and junior high school students spending more time with family and sleeping, their sleep rhythms, eating habits, and physical activities were disrupted. As the children’s living environment changed, they felt less active and vigorous and had difficulty finding things that interested them. However, their sleep improved and overall, the number of children with potential mental health problems did not change.","Saito, Mari; Kikuchi, Yutaka; Lefor, Alan Kawarai; Hoshina, Masaru",Pediatr Int,473,29

Furthermore, it provides a sense of ownership, resources to help integrate new communities, and a space to nurture existing cultural identities for intersectionally diverse gardeners. This sense of belonging in connection with access to growing plots has been linked to psychological well-being and resilience. However, little is known about how the psychosocial benefits of plot ownership affect resilience and which aspects of this resilience are salient. OBJECTIVE: This community-based participatory research (CBPR) project will examine the role of community gardens in decreasing food insecurity and facilitating various forms of resilience in food-insecure groups in Rochester, Minnesota. Since participation in community gardens nurtures various forms of resilience along individual, group, and community dimensions, our research seeks to understand how dimensions of resilience vary along intersectional lines. In addition to mapping the psychosocial benefits linked to plot ownership, we find that examining which forms of resilience are fostered in community-based agricultural projects addresses an important gap in the academic literature. This can help us propose policy-level practices that reduce health inequities connected to food and nutrition at the local level. METHODS: Using a mixed methods approach, this ongoing community-campus partnership will examine the experiences of current and new plot owners. As a CBPR project, our data collection plan, from design to dissemination, incorporates the intellectual and creative labor of the individuals representing members of the campus community (ie, college students and faculty members engaged in other citizen science projects hosted by the garden), community growers, individuals involved in the community garden’s board, and representatives of various organizational bodies. Data collection activities will consist of surveys, in-depth interviews, and photovoice. RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2020 and approved by the University of Minnesota's Institutional Review Board in March 2020. For the 2020 growing season, we will conduct evaluative interviews about the effect of COVID-19 on community gardeners, including their experiences during this growing season. For the 2021 growing season, data collection, via pre- and postsurveys, is projected to begin in March 2021 and end in November 2021. We will also conduct in-depth interviews from January to April 2021. Data analysis will commence in April 2021. Photovoice activities (ie, data collection, analysis, synthesis, and dissemination) are expected to take place during the spring and summer of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Findings emerging from this study will provide the preliminary data to foreground community gardening projects and initiatives to improve physical and mental health outcomes in food-insecure communities. Also, the data collected will highlight the role of CBPR methods in disseminating information about the organizational practices of the community garden; this will assist others in planning and implementing similar projects.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the relationship between comorbid burden and adverse outcomes in adults with SARS-CoV-2 of different ages (18–64, 65–79 and ≥ 80 years). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Observational longitudinal cohort study of 170,528 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System between 2/28/20 and 12/31/2020 who were followed through 01/31/2021. MEASUREMENTS: Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); Incidence of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and death within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: The cumulative 30-day incidence of death was 0.8% in cohort members < 65 years, 7.1% in those aged 65–79 years and 20.6% in those aged ≥80 years. The respective 30-day incidences of hospitalization were 8.2, 21.7 and 29.5%, of ICU admission were 2.7, 8.6, and 11% and of mechanical ventilation were 1, 3.9 and 3.2%. Median CCI (interquartile range) ranged from 0.0 (0.0, 2.0) in the youngest, to 4 (2.0, 7.0) in the oldest age group. The adjusted association of CCI with all outcomes was attenuated at older ages such that the threshold level of CCI above which the risk for each outcome exceeded the reference group (1st quartile) was lower in younger than in older cohort members (p < 0.001 for all age group interactions). LIMITATIONS: The CCI is calculated based on diagnostic codes, which may not provide an accurate assessment of comorbid burden. CONCLUSIONS: Age differences in the distribution and prognostic significance of overall comorbid burden could inform clinical management, vaccination prioritization and population health during the pandemic and argue for more work to understand the role of age and comorbidity in shaping the care of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2.

Because there is no specific therapeutic drug, drug repurposing has been proposed. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising drug against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to control its replication, and several compounds have been suggested. The present study predicts relative efficacies of thirty known or repurposed compounds in inhibiting the RdRp. METHODS: The three-dimensional structure of the target enzyme was loaded into Molegro virtual docker software, followed by chemical structures of the test compounds. The docking was performed between the compounds and the active site of the enzyme to determine docking scores, and the energy liberated when the two dock. Thus, docking scores signify the affinity of ligand(s) with the active site of enzyme(s) and thus its inhibitory potential. RESULTS: Among known inhibitors, remdesivir was found to have the highest affinity for the active site of the RdRp. Among all compounds, chlorhexidine was predicted as the most potent inhibitor. Furthermore, the results predict the relative efficacy of different drugs as inhibitors of the drug target. CONCLUSION: While the study identifies several compounds as inhibitors of RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, the prediction of their relative efficacies may be useful in future studies. While nucleoside analogs compete with the natural substrate of RdRp, thereby terminating RNA replication, other compounds would physically block entry of the natural substrates into the active site. Thus, based on the findings, we recommend in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials to determine their effectiveness against COVID-19.","Choudhury, Shuvasish; Moulick, Debojyoti; Saikia, Purbajyoti; Mazumder, Muhammed Khairujjaman",Med J Armed Forces India,473,24

High quality serology is a key tool to understanding the spread of infection, immunity against the virus, and correlates of protection. Limited validation and testing of serology assays used for serosurveys can lead to unreliable or misleading data, and clinical testing using such unvalidated assays can lead to medically costly diagnostic errors and improperly informed public health decisions. Estimating prevalence and clinical decision making is highly dependent on specificity. Here, we present an optimized ELISA-based serology protocol from antigen production to data analysis. This protocol defines thresholds for IgG and IgM for determination of seropositivity with estimated specificity well above 99%. Validation was performed using both traditionally collected serum and dried blood on mail-in blood sampling kits, using archival (pre-2019) negative controls and known PCR-diagnosed positive patient controls. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed for the spike proteins of MERS, SARS1, OC43 and HKU1 viruses and no cross reactivity was observed with anti-influenza A H1N1 HAI titer during validation. This strategy is highly specific and is designed to provide good estimates of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in a population, providing specific and reliable data from serosurveys and clinical testing which can be used to better evaluate and understand SARS-CoV-2 immunity and correlates of protection.","Klumpp-Thomas, C.; Kalish, H.; Drew, M.; Hunsberger, S.; Snead, K.; Fay, M.

Chronic subdural haematoma (cSDH) has a unique natural history in which symptoms can be non-specific, and the onset is insidious. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation of cSDH. METHODS: Consecutive adult cSDH patients admitted from 1 March 2020 to 30 April 2020 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria including those who had no definite history of head injury or the diagnosis of cSDH were made from a scheduled follow-up scan. Corresponding data during the same period in 2019 were reviewed for comparison. The primary outcome was the interval between the initial head injury and the final radiological diagnosis of cSDH. Secondary outcomes include Markwalder chronic subdural haematoma grade upon admission, length of stay in the acute hospital, and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) upon discharge. RESULTS: For the primary outcome, the average interval between head injury and the diagnosis of cSDH was significantly longer at 56.6 days (49 to 74 days, SD 9.83 days) during the period from March to April 2020, versus 29.4 days (17 to 42 days, SD 8.59 days) in 2019 for the corresponding period (p = 0.00703).

Extraordinary circumstances such as epidemics/pandemics and product recalls, bring extra burden on the health institutions in terms of PPE availability. Thus, shortages could occur, and PPE that provides an appropriate level of protection might not be available.

In many respects, the theory and its applications may appear so overwhelming for many studying the field for the first time, that they rarely can spend the time just needed to understand the basic measurements and their interpretations. A variety of applications in analytical chemistry especially have resulted in a greater understanding of many of the macromolecular processes themselves from molar mass distributions, to the macromolecular interactions responsible for aggregation processes, to determinations of structure and function.

Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray‐based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described.

Thousands of mutations have accumulated and continue to since the emergence of the virus. As novel mutations continue appearing at the scene, naturally, new variants are increasingly observed. Since the first occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, a wide variety of drug compounds affecting the binding sites of the virus have begun to be studied. As the drug and vaccine trials are continuing, it is of utmost importance to take into consideration the SARS-CoV-2 mutations and their respective frequencies since these data could lead the way to multi-drug combinations. The lack of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against human coronaviruses necessitates research that is of interest to the clinical applications. The reason why the mutations in glycoprotein S lead to vaccine escape is related to the location of the mutation and the affinity of the protein. At the same time, it can be said that variations should occur in areas such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and vaccines and antiviral drugs should be formulated by targeting more than one viral protein. In this review, a literature survey in the scope of the increasing SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the viral variations is conducted. In the light of the current knowledge, the various disguises of mutant SARS-CoV-2 forms and their apparent differences from the original strain are examined as they could possibly aid in finding clinical therapeutic approaches.","Cosar, Begum; Karagulleoglu, Zeynep Yagmur; Unal, Sinan; Ince, Ahmet Turan; Uncuoglu, Dilruba Beyza; Tuncer, Gizem; Kilinc, Bugrahan Regaip; Ozkan, Yunus Emre; Ozkoc, Hikmet Ceyda; Demir, Ibrahim Naki; Eker, Ali; Karagoz, Feyzanur; Simsek, Said Yasin; Yasar, Bunyamin; Pala, Mehmetcan; Demir, Aysegul; Atak, Irem Naz; Mendi, Aysegul Hanife; Bengi, Vahdi Umut; Cengiz Seval, Guldane; Kilic, Pelin; Demir-Dora, Devrim",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,473,24

Some of the HmAbs were S1 domain specific, while some were not. In this study, we describe non-S1 binding neutralizing HmAbs that can specifically bind to the conserved S2 domain of the S protein. However, unlike the S1 specific HmAbs, the S2 specific HmAbs can neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing different S proteins containing receptor binding domain sequences of various clinical isolates. These data indicate that HmAbs which bind to conserved regions of the S protein are more suitable for conferring protection against a wide range of SARS-CoV variants and have implications for generating therapeutic antibodies or subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses.","Elshabrawy, Hatem A.; Coughlin, Melissa M.; Baker, Susan C.; Prabhakar, Bellur S.",PLoS One,473,21

This qualitative study explored barriers and enablers for the implementation of these measures in German dental practices. Methods: Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted in November/December 2020 (purposive/snowball sampling). The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the Capabilities, Opportunities and Motivations influencing Behaviors model (COM-B) were used to guide interviews. Mayring’s content analysis was employed to analyze interviews. Results: All dentists (28–71 years, 4/8 female/male) had implemented infection control measures. Measures most frequently not adopted were FFP2 masks, face shields (impractical), the rotation of teams (insufficient staffing) and the avoidance of aerosol-generating treatments. Dentists with personal COVID-19 experience or those seeing themselves as a role model were more eager to adopt measures. We identified 34 enablers and 20 barriers. Major barriers were the lack of knowledge, guidelines and recommendations as well as limited availability and high costs of equipment. Pressure by staff and patients to ensure infection control was an enabler. Conclusions: Dentists are motivated to implement infection control measures, but lacking opportunities limited the adoption of certain measures. Policy makers and equipment manufacturers should address these points to increase the implementation of infection control measures against COVID-19 and potential future pandemics.","Müller, Anne; Melzow, Florentina Sophie; Göstemeyer, Gerd; Paris, Sebastian; Schwendicke, Falk",Int J Environ Res Public Health,473,16

Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in northwest Amhara referral hospitals. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th September to 20th October 2020. A total of 302 nurses were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered into EpiData version 3 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A binary logistic regression model was used to compute bivariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses was 69.6%, 55.3%, and 20.5%, respectively. Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety. Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression. Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing stress. CONCLUSION: More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively. It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health. The government shall develop and implement national programs for occupational health and safety, prevent violence in the workplace, improve psychological well-being, and protect from physical and biological hazards to take care of the mental health of healthcare professionals during this pandemic.","Mekonen, Enyew; Shetie, Belayneh; Muluneh, Niguse",Psychol Res Behav Manag,473,28

This study aims to assess the magnitude of psychological distress and associated factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large tertiary hospital located in north-east Italy. METHODS: All healthcare and administrative staff working in the Verona University Hospital (Veneto, Italy) during the COVID-19 pandemic were asked to complete a web-based survey from 21 April to 6 May 2020. Symptoms of post-traumatic distress, anxiety and depression were assessed, respectively, using the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Personal socio-demographic information and job characteristics were also collected, including gender, age, living condition, having pre-existing psychological problems, occupation, length of working experience, hospital unit (ICUs and sub-intensive COVID-19 units vs. non-COVID-19 units). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with each of the three mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 2195 healthcare workers (36.9% of the overall hospital staff) participated in the study. Of the participants, 35.7% were nurses, 24.3% other healthcare staff, 16.4% residents, 13.9% physicians and 9.7% administrative staff. Nine per cent of healthcare staff worked in ICUs, 8% in sub-intensive COVID-19 units and 7.6% in other front-line services, while the remaining staff worked in hospital units not directly engaged with COVID-19 patients. Overall, 63.2% of participants reported COVID-related traumatic experiences at work and 53.8% (95% CI 51.0%–56.6%) showed symptoms of post-traumatic distress; moreover, 50.1% (95% CI 47.9%–52.3%) showed symptoms of clinically relevant anxiety and 26.6% (95% CI 24.7%–28.5%) symptoms of at least moderate depression. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that women, nurses, healthcare workers directly engaged with COVID-19 patients and those with pre-existing psychological problems were at increased risk of psychopathological consequences of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare staff working in a highly burdened geographical of north-east Italy is relevant and to some extent greater than that reported in China. The study provides solid grounds to elaborate and implement interventions pertaining to psychology and occupational health.","Lasalvia, A.; Bonetto, C.; Porru, S.; Carta, A.; Tardivo, S.; Bovo, C.; Ruggeri, M.; Amaddeo, F.",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,473,3

In this study, thirty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled with 244 serial blood specimens (38.1% after hospital discharge) collected to explore the chronological evolution of neutralizing (NAb), total (TAb), IgM, IgG and IgA antibody in parallel. IgG titers reached a peak later (approximately 35 days postonset) than those of Nab, Ab, IgM and IgA (20~25 days postonset). After peaking, IgM levels declined with an estimated average half-life of 10.36 days, which was more rapid than those of IgA (51.25 days) and IgG (177.39 days). Based on these half-life data, we estimate that the median times for IgM, IgA and IgG to become seronegative are 4.59 (IQR 4.12-5.03), 7.78 (IQR 6.71-9.16) and 42.72 (IQR 33.75-47.96) months post disease onset. The relative contribution of IgM to NAb was higher than that of IgG (standardized {beta} regression coefficient: 0.53 vs 0.48), so the rapid decline in NAb may be attributed to the rapid decay of IgM in acute phase. However, the relative contribution of IgG to NAb increased and that of IgM further decreased after 6 weeks postonset. It's assumed that the decline rate of NAb might slow down to the same level as that of IgG over time. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces robust neutralizing and binding antibody responses in patients and that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 acquired by infection may persist for a relatively long time.","Yao, Xiang-Yang; Liu, Wei; Li, Zhi-Yong; Xiong, Hua-Long; Su, Ying-Ying; Li, Tingdong; Zhang, Shi-Yin; Zhang, Xue-Jie; Bi, Zhao-Feng; Deng, Chen-Xi; Li, Cai-Yu; Yuan, Quan; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Tian-Ying; Wang, Zhan-Xiang; Ge, Sheng-xiang; Ningshao, Xia",,473,24

A cross-sectional study, including a self-reported running questionnaire completed after the first outdoor running session after quarantine, was performed. Three hundred recreational runners (74% males; 60% 18–40 years old; most typical running experience >3 years, 10–30 km weekly running distance distributed in 3–4 sessions) were considered for analysis. Advanced runners ran, at least, 4 days/week and participated in running events. They performed significantly longer and more non-supervised weekly training sessions during confinement (p < 0.01 for both) than novice and amateur runners.

We provide predictions about one such new inequality using the logic of Status Construction Theory (SCT). SCT, rooted in Expectations State Theory and from there developed by Ridgeway and colleagues, proposes general hypotheses about how new inequalities arise through process of interaction at the individual level: an unordered categorical difference becomes attached to a cultural value that gives one category more value than the other; social scripts concerning it emerge; small elements of assertion and deference creep into more and more encounters that an individual participates in, hears about through networks, and learns about via social and conventional media. The categorical difference begins to morph into a hierarchical status distinction. Through these mechanisms, individuals develop “status beliefs” that most people in their communities endorse the status distinction. Although they may or may not endorse the distinction personally, they believe that most people do so and they find that the path of least resistance socially is to enact the scripts that affirm the higher status/prestige of the favored group. We apply Status Construction Theory to the categorical difference between Antibody Positives (who have been tested for IgG antibodies) and Others (everybody else). Using the general logic of SCT and specifically developing applications of its key propositions, we predict that the categorical difference between Antibody Positives and Others will transition to a status distinction and propose testable, falsifiable hypotheses about each step of the process.","Evans, M.

In particular, low intrinsic mortality risks on islands with reduced predator numbers and not subject to harsh winter climates may in principle support the development of stocks with extended longevity. Conversely, the conditions under which laboratory rodents are typically bred are thought to select for genotypes that produce large, rapidly maturing races with high early reproductive rates but diminished longevity. To test these ideas, and to generate new mouse stocks suitable for genetic and molecular analysis of the processes that time life‐history events, we have developed specific pathogen‐free stocks from mice trapped from three distinct populations: the U.S. mainland (Idaho) and the tropical Pacific islands Majuro and Pohnpei. Mice from all three locations were found to be shorter and lighter, to have smaller litters, and to have higher faecal corticosterone levels than mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock derived from four common laboratory inbred strains. Among the wild‐derived stocks, mice from Pohnpei and Majuro were significantly lighter and shorter than Idaho‐derived animals, even in populations kept from birth under identical housing conditions. Litter size and reproductive success rates did not differ significantly among the three wild‐derived stocks. Although further work will be needed to see if, as predicted, the wild‐derived stocks differ from one another and from laboratory mice in longevity, these stocks provide useful tools for genetic dissection of factors that regulate body size and reproductive success.","Miller, Richard A.; Dysko, Robert; Chrisp, Clarence; Seguin, Renee; Linsalata, Luann; Buehner, Gretchen; Harper, James M.; Austad, Steven",J Zool (1987),473,24

All labeled cDNAs and prepared gene chips were subjected to specific hybridization. The results showed that extensive cross-reaction existed between CCoV, FCoV, FIPV, TGEV and PRCoV, while there was no cross-reaction between BCoV, TCoV and HRCoV. The ultimate specific gene chip was developed with DNA fragments reamplified from the chosen recombinant plasmids without cross-reaction between different coronaviruses.

In-Silico Molecular docking was performed with the Native ligand and the 15 flavonoid based phytochemicals of Calendula officinals to check their binding affinity towards the COVID-19 main protease. Finally, the top 3 compounds with the highest affinity have been chosen for molecular dynamics simulation to analyses their dynamic properties and conformational flexibility or stability. In-Silico Docking showed that major phytochemicals of Calendula officinals i.e. rutin, isorhamnetin-3-O-β-D, calendoflaside, narcissin, calendulaglycoside B, calenduloside, calendoflavoside have better binding energy than the native ligand (inhibitor N3). MD simulation of 100 ns revealed that all the protease-ligand docked complexes are overall stable as compare to M(pro)-native ligand (inhibitor N3) complex. Overall, rutin and caledoflaside showed better stability, compactness, and flexibility. Our in silico (Virtual molecular docking and Molecular dynamics simulation) studies pointed out that flavonoid based phytochemicals of calendula (rutin, isorhamnetin-3-O-β-D, calendoflaside) may be highly effective for inhibiting M(pro) which is the main protease for SARS-CoV-2 causing the deadly disease COVID-19. Rutin is already used as a drug and the other two compounds can be made available for future use. Thus the study points a way to combat COVID-19 by the use of major flavonoid based phytochemicals of Calendula officinals. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

International practice currently encourages integrated care for physical and mental health in oncology. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the delivery of healthcare services across the world. The current research paper is on the psycho-oncology service provision for hospitalised cancer patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients who were referred to psycho-oncology services during the study period of 1 month, in the two successive years of 2019 and 2020, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected from the centralised electronic medical records for patients. Data included cancer diagnosis, reason for admission, admitting team and reason for a psychiatric referral. Other parameters that were measured were the timing of the psychiatric assessment, psychiatric diagnosis and psycho-oncology care provided, which included psychological interventions carried out and medications prescribed. The overall institutional data on cancer care provision are also presented in brief to provide context to the psycho-oncology services. RESULTS: Integrated psycho-oncology services reviewed and managed patients round the year in the hospital where the study was conducted. During the 1-month study period, in 2019 and 2020, the total number of hospitalised cancer patients managed by the services was 74 and 52, respectively. During the study period of 2020, 292 patients with cancer who were being treated in the hospital had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tested on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 50 members of healthcare staff also tested positive. The most common diagnosis of patients was found to be stress-related adjustment disorder [16/74 (21.6%) in 2019 and 16/52 (30.8%) in 2020]. The paper discusses the common stressors voiced by the patients and their caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several challenges of providing psychological services were overcome by the team and the paper touches upon the common strategies that were used during the pandemic. Most patients did not need medications, but a significant minority did benefit from treatment with psychotropic medications. Simple psychological interventions such as sleep hygiene, supportive therapy sessions and psycho-education benefited many patients and were feasible even during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The provision of psycho-oncology services to cancer patients and their caregivers was important before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 1241 calves up to 6 months of age were reared in the farms, and 63 (5%) of them had signs of diarrhoea. Two farms had an overall higher prevalence (13% and 21%) of diarrhoea. Faecal samples were collected from all diarrhoeal calves (n = 63) and from 330 healthy calves and analysed for Salmonella species, Campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Salmonella spp. was isolated in only 2% of all calves. Campylobacter was isolated in 11% of all calves, irrespective of health condition, and was more frequent (25%) in one of the 2 diarrhoeal farms (p = 0.001). 80% of the isolates were identified as C. jejuni. No ETEC strains were detected among the 55 tested strains from diarrhoeal calves, but 22/55 (40%) strains from diarrhoeal calves and 14/88 (16%) strains from healthy calves carried the K99 adhesin (p = 0.001). 6,757 E. coli isolates were typed with a biochemical fingerprinting method (the PhenePlate™) giving the same E. coli diversity in healthy and diarrhoeal calves. Thus it was concluded: i) the overall prevalence of diarrhoea was low, but 2 farms had a higher prevalence that could be due to an outbreak situation, ii) Salmonella did not seem to be associated with diarrhoea, iii) Campylobacter jejuni was common at one of the 2 diarrhoeal farms and iv) ETEC strains were not found, but K99 antigen was more prevalent in E. coli strains from diarrhoeal calves than from healthy, as well as more prevalent in one diarrhoeal farm.","Achá, SJ; Kühn, I; Jonsson, P; Mbazima, G; Katouli, M; Möllby, R",Acta Vet Scand,473,3

In this study, we have developed an unbiased modeling approach to identify new pathways and network connections mediating acute lung injury, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen. We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes. This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection. With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice. We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity. The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar damage and acute lung injury, following infection with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV.","Gralinski, Lisa E.; Bankhead, Armand; Jeng, Sophia; Menachery, Vineet D.; Proll, Sean; Belisle, Sarah E.; Matzke, Melissa; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M.; Luna, Maria L.; Shukla, Anil K.; Ferris, Martin T.; Bolles, Meagan; Chang, Jean; Aicher, Lauri; Waters, Katrina M.; Smith, Richard D.; Metz, Thomas O.; Law, G.

METHODS: The Compassion Fatigue and Satisfaction Self-Test (CFST) and a questionnaire of personal/professional characteristics were distributed electronically to pediatric subspecialists. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in pre- and early-pandemic CF, BO, and CS scores. Nearly 40% of respondents felt their contributions to the pandemic were not valued by their institutions. Higher CF scores were significantly associated with: higher BO score; “I have put myself at increased risk through my work”; working in one’s specialty >50% of time; distress about mental health and/or future uncertainty. Higher BO scores were significantly associated with: higher CF score; “Self-care is not a priority”; emotional depletion. Higher CS scores were significantly associated with: “My institution values my contribution to the COVID-19 crisis”; workplace debriefs; pet therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has only increased the need for physicians to receive social/emotional support from their institution and to feel their workplace contributions are valued. Successful pre-pandemic workplace interventions may not adequately support physicians during the pandemic. Further study is needed to identify supports that best counter the pandemic’s unprecedented challenges. IMPACT: The sentiment “My institution has valued my contribution to the Covid-19 crisis” was the only significant factor associated with lower BO scores and was also associated with higher CS scores in pediatric subspecialists. This study is the first comparison of pre- and early-pandemic CF, BO, and CS scores in a national cohort of pediatric subspecialists. When considering interventions to promote CS and mitigate CF and BO for pediatric subspecialists during and after the pandemic, institutional leadership must offer wellness programming focused on social/emotional supports and prioritize a culture that explicitly recognizes and values every physician’s contributions.","Kase, Samuel M.; Gribben, Jeanie L.; Guttmann, Katherine F.; Waldman, Elisha D.; Weintraub, Andrea S.",Pediatr Res,473,16

This paper reports NMR structure determinations of the C-terminal domain (SUD-C) and of a two-domain construct (SUD-MC) containing the middle domain (SUD-M) and the C-terminal domain, and NMR data on the conformational states of the N-terminal domain (SUD-N) and the SUD-NM two-domain construct. Both SUD-N and SUD-NM are monomeric and globular in solution, and in SUD-NM there is high mobility in the two-residue interdomain linking sequence, with no preferred relative orientation of the two domains. SUD-C adopts a frataxin-like fold and has structural similarity to DNA-binding domains of DNA-modifying enzymes. The structures of both SUD-M (previously determined) and SUD-C (from the present study) are maintained in SUD-MC, where the two domains are flexibly linked. Gel shift experiments showed that both SUD-C and SUD-MC bind to single-stranded RNA and recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases, whereby SUD-MC binds to a more restricted set of purine-containing RNA sequences than SUD-M. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments with observation of the (15)N-labeled proteins further resulted in the delineation of the RNA binding sites, i.e., in SUD-M a positively charged surface area with a pronounced cavity, and in SUD-C several residues of an antiparallel β-sheet. Overall, the present data provide evidence for molecular mechanisms involving concerted actions of SUD-M and SUD-C, which result in specific RNA-binding that might be unique to the SUD, and thus to the SARS-CoV.","Johnson, Margaret A.; Chatterjee, Amarnath; Neuman, Benjamin W.; Wüthrich, Kurt",Journal of Molecular Biology,473,16

With quarantine measures in place, and in the absence of travel and party photos on social media, do individuals feel they are missing out on enjoyable experiences? The current work shows that FOMO has not disappeared during the pandemic, even when socially distancing at home, but has been replaced by feelings towards new online activities (e.g., online concerts, virtual gatherings). As a consequence, we find that FOMO threatens well-being by causing important psychological and health issues, such as sleep deprivation, loss of focus, declined productivity, and finding relief in knowing that others have difficulty keeping up with abundant digital content. Importantly, we find these consequential effects both during the initial (May 2020) and late stages (December 2020) of the pandemic. With excessive Internet use and virtual FOMO likely to be a continuing reality of life, questions remain as to how one can refrain from its negative effects and stay healthy during the pandemic and in the post-pandemic era.

Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of AKI in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to medicine and intensive care unit (ICU) wards, its association with in-hospital mortality, and disease severity. Our aim was to stratify these outcomes by out-of-hospital AKI and in-hospital AKI. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from a registry of patients with COVID-19. SETTING: Three community and 3 academic hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 815 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 4, 2020, and April 23, 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Stage of AKI, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We classified AKI by comparing highest to lowest recorded serum creatinine in hospital and staged AKI based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) system. We calculated the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio for the stage of AKI and the outcomes of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 815 patients registered, 439 (53.9%) developed AKI, 253 (57.6%) presented with AKI, and 186 (42.4%) developed AKI in-hospital. The odds of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death increased as the AKI stage worsened. Stage 3 AKI that occurred during hospitalization increased the odds of death (odds ratio [OR] = 7.87 [4.35, 14.23]). Stage 3 AKI that occurred prior to hospitalization carried an increased odds of death (OR = 5.28 [2.60, 10.73]). LIMITATIONS: Observational study with small sample size limits precision of estimates. Lack of nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hospitalized patients without COVID-19 as controls limits causal inferences. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury, whether it occurs prior to or after hospitalization, is associated with a high risk of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Routine assessment of kidney function in patients with COVID-19 may improve risk stratification.

This study investigated how three common face mask types (N95, surgical, and cloth) affected acoustic analysis of speech and perceived intelligibility in healthy subjects. Acoustic measures of timing, frequency, perturbation, and power spectral density were measured. Speech intelligibility and word and sentence accuracy were also examined using the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech. Mask type impacted the power distribution in frequencies above 3 kHz for the N95 mask, and above 5 kHz in surgical and cloth masks. Measures of timing and spectral tilt mainly differed with N95 mask use. Cepstral and harmonics to noise ratios remained unchanged across mask type. No differences were observed across conditions for word or sentence intelligibility measures; however, accuracy of word and sentence translations were affected by all masks. Data presented in this study show that face masks change the speech signal, but some specific acoustic features remain largely unaffected (e.g., measures of voice quality) irrespective of mask type.

While epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe disease among patients remain poorly understood. Methods In this retrospective study, we analysed data of 820 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between January 1st and April 23rd, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for early risk assessment, we used data available during patients' initial presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital stay: A) admission to intensive care, B) need for mechanical ventilation and C) mortality. Based on the trained models, we extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these patient trajectories. Results Considering our inclusion criteria, we have identified 126 of 820 (15%) patients that required intensive care, 62 of 808 (8%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 170 of 630 (27%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high accuracy, the best model achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.75 to 0.83 (F1 scores of 0.41 to 0.56). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality. Clinical indicators of a patient's oxygen supply and selected laboratory results were most predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Conclusion Among COVID-19 patients machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient's first presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.","Heldt, F. S.; Vizcaychipi, M.

METHODS: 200 patients underwent elective, unilateral primary day case total hip (THA, n = 94), total knee (TKA, n = 60) and unicondylar knee replacements (UKA, n = 46). SDD rates, reasons for failure to discharge, readmission, complication and satisfaction rates were recorded at 6-week follow up. Changes in LOS of inpatient arthroplasties (n = 6518) and rate of patients discharged with only one night stay treated at the same ward were tracked from 1 year prior to introduction of day case arthroplasty (DCA) program to the end of observation period. RESULTS: 166 patients (83%) had SDD while 34 (17%) needed overnight stay. Main reasons for failure to discharge were lack of confidence (4%) fainting due to single vasovagal episode (3.5%), urine retention (3%) and late resolution of spinal anaesthesia (3%). 5 patients (3%) had readmission within 6 weeks, including 1 (0.6%) with a partial and treated pulmonary embolism. 163 patients were satisfied with SDD (98%). After launching the DCA program, average LOS of inpatients was reduced from 2.3 days to 1.8 days and rate of discharge with only 1-night stay increased from 12% to around 60%. CONCLUSION: Introduction of routine SDD hip and knee arthroplasty programme at an elective orthopaedic centre is safe and also may confer wider benefits leading to shorter inpatient hospital stays.","Lovasz, Gyorgy; Aros, Attila; Toth, Ferenc; Va Faye, John; La Malfa, Marco",J Orthop Surg Res,473,8

In the fall of 2020, newly matriculated medical students around the country started medical school in a remote learning setting. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic on academic performance and student satisfaction among first-year medical students. Methods The newest cohort of first-year medical students (class of 2024; n = 128) who completed their first basic science course, ""Genes, Molecules & Cells (GMC),"" using an adapted remote format was compared to the prior year's cohort (class of 2023; n = 122) of first-year medical students who were taught using traditional approaches. The items that were compared were numerical performance on exams and quizzes, study strategies, and course evaluation in GMC. Data were analyzed with a two-sided t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient. Students' perception of remote learning was also reported and results were obtained using a five-point Likert scale through anonymous surveys via E-value. Results No statistical difference was observed in students' performance on the midterm and final examinations between the two cohorts in both multiple-choice and written examinations. Mean multiple-choice question (MCQ) midterm students' performance in remote learning compared to traditional learning cohort was 75.9%, standard deviation (SD) 6.1 to 75.89%, SD 6.49, respectively. Mean MCQ final students' performance was 84%, SD 6.37 (class of 2024) to 85%, SD 8.78 (class of 2023). Students’ satisfaction with their learning experience was similar among the two groups (class of 2024: mean = 4.61, SD 0.66; class of 2023: mean = 4.57, SD 0.68). Most students (70%) in the remote learning cohort had a positive opinion of remote learning. Of the students, 17% reported feeling disconnected, isolated, or not actively involved. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that not only is remote learning effective but that the students were also resilient in their adaptation to a new learning format. Our experience highlights the importance of including wellness solutions to mitigate the feeling of isolation and disconnection during remote learning.","Conway, Nicholas B; Tempest, Helen G; Fortun, Jenny",Cureus,473,16

Methodology: 8162 participants (mean age 48.7 years,54.5% males) with RT-PCR positive COVID-19 were included. The electronic medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. Results: The in-hospital mortality was 11.2%. There was a statistically significant strong association of in-hospital mortality with age >60 years old (OR:4.7; 95% CI 4.1-5.4;p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR:4.6; 95% CI 3.99-5.32;p<0.001), hypertension (OR:3.9; 95% CI 3.4-4.5;p<0.001), coronary artery disease (OR:2.7; 95% CI 2.2-3.2;p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR:2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.5;p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR:4.8; 95% CI 3.9-5.9;p<0.001), malignancy (OR:3.7; 95% CI 2.3-5.75;p<0.001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio >3.1 (OR:6.4; 95% CI 4.4-9.5;P< 0.001), and ground glass opacities (GGOs) in CT chest (OR:3.5; 95% CI 2.84-4.4;P<0.001), respectively.

MERS emerged in 2012 and has a high mortality associated with severe lung disease. A lack of autopsy studies from MERS fatalities has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We investigated the spatial and cellular localization of DPP4 to evaluate an association MERS clinical disease. DPP4 was rarely detected in the surface epithelium from nasal cavity to conducting airways with a slightly increased incidence in distal airways. DPP4 was also found in a subset of mononuclear leukocytes and in serous cells of submucosal glands. In the parenchyma, DPP4 was found principally in type I and II cells and alveolar macrophages and was also detected in vascular endothelium (eg, lymphatics) and pleural mesothelia. Patients with chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, exhibited increased DPP4 immunostaining in alveolar epithelia (type I and II cells) and alveolar macrophages with similar trends in reactive mesothelia. This finding suggests that preexisting pulmonary disease could increase MERS-CoV receptor abundance and predispose individuals to MERS morbidity and mortality, which is consistent with current clinical observations. We speculate that the preferential spatial localization of DPP4 in alveolar regions may explain why MERS is characterized by lower respiratory tract disease.","Meyerholz, David K.; Lambertz, Allyn M.; McCray, Paul B.",The American Journal of Pathology,473,1

In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus nationwide lockdown restrictions were introduced. This review aims to scope the literature on the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on the presentation and management of trauma globally. Methods; A scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic search was carried out on the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases to identify papers investigating presentation and management of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. All studies based on patients admitted with orthopaedic trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Exclusion criteria were opinion-based reports, reviews, studies that did not provide quantitative data and papers not in English. Results; Three hundred and thirty seven studies were screened, with 17 meeting the eligibility criteria. Studies reported on the footfall of trauma in the UK, Europe, Asia, USA, Australia and New Zealand. A total of 29,591 patients during the pandemic were considered. Mean age was 43.7 years (range <1–103); 54.8% were male. Reported reductions in trauma footfall ranged from 20.3% to 84.6%, with a higher proportion of trauma occurring secondary to interpersonal violence, deliberate self-harm and falls from a height. A decrease was seen in road traffic collisions, sports injuries and trauma occurring outdoors. There was no significant change in the proportion of patients managed operatively, and the number of trauma patients reported to be COVID-19 positive was low. Conclusion; Whilst the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in the number of trauma patients; the services managing trauma have continued to function despite infrastructural, personnel and pathway changes in health systems. The substantial effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective orthopaedics is well described, however the contents of this review evidence minimal change in the delivery of effective trauma care despite resource constraints during this global COVID-19 pandemic.","Waseem, S.; Nayar, S.K.; Hull, P.; Carrothers, A.; Rawal, J.; Chou, D.; Khanduja, V.",J Clin Orthop Trauma,473,22

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 than any other organ. The large intestine, kidney and testis showed moderate signals, whereas the signal was weak in the lung. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung. IMPORTANCE Vaccines and new medicines are urgently needed to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, reduce the symptoms, shorten the duration of disease, prevent virus spread in the body, and most importantly to save lives. One of the key drug targets could be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a crucial receptor for the corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). It is known that SARS coronavirus infections lead to worse outcome in the elderly and in males. Therefore, one aim of the present study was to investigate whether age or sex could contribute to the regulation of ACE2 expression. We also decided to explore the transcriptional regulation of ACE2 gene expression. Since data on ACE2 distribution is still conflicting, we aimed to get a more comprehensive view of the cell types expressing the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we studied the coexpression of ACE2 with other genes and explored its putative functions using gene ontology enrichment analysis.","Barker, Harlan; Parkkila, Seppo",bioRxiv,473,24

We hypothesized that convalescent plasma would improve outcomes for critically ill adult patients with Covid-19. METHODS In an ongoing adaptive platform trial, critically ill patients with confirmed Covid-19, defined as receiving intensive care-level organ support, were randomized to open-label convalescent plasma or not (i.e., control group). The primary end point was organ support-free days (i.e., days alive and free of ICU-based organ support) up to day 21. The primary analysis was a Bayesian cumulative logistic model with predefined criteria for superiority or futility. An odds ratio greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support-free days, or both. RESULTS The convalescent plasma intervention was stopped after pre-specified criteria for futility were met. At that time, 1084 participants had been randomized to convalescent plasma and 916 to no convalescent plasma (control). The median organ support-free days were 0 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) for the convalescent plasma group and 3 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) days for the control group. The median adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.97 (95% credible interval 0.83 to 1.15) and posterior probability of futility (OR < 1.2) was 99.4% for convalescent plasma compared to control. In-hospital mortality was 37.3% (401/1075) in convalescent plasma group, and 38.4% (347/904) in controls. The observed treatment effects were consistent across primary and secondary outcomes.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic might exacerbate these disparities as supply and demand for screening services are reduced. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) provides cancer screening services to women with low income and inadequate health insurance. We examined COVID-19's impact on NBCCEDP screening services during January-June 2020. We found the total number of NBCCEDP-funded breast and cervical cancer screening tests declined by 87% and 84%, respectively, during April 2020 compared with the previous 5-year averages for that month. The extent of declines varied by geography, race/ethnicity, and rurality.

These data are collected pre- and post-LVAD implantation. Though previous studies have shown that overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improves at one year after implantation, specific factors that predict a higher quality of life have not been identified. Hypothesis Self-perceived quality of life after LVAD implant is influenced by demographics and preexisting comorbidities. Methods We identified 118 patients in the INTERMACS database who received a LVAD at our institution. Of these, 26 patients completed the KCCQ-12 questionnaire and 32 patients completed VAS at 1-year follow up. An exploratory data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, correlation tests, and non-parametric comparison tests such as Wilcoxon rank-sum to identify important trends and predictors for changes in HRQoL. Multiple variables (patient characteristics, clinical data) were tested independently against the KCCQ-12 and VAS scores at one year and with the absolute change in these scores over a one-year period. Due to low sample size, we were not able to perform a multivariate model. Results New York Heart Association Class IV symptoms at baseline (p=0.01) were predictive of large gains in VAS scores at one year. Frailty, although not reaching significance, may be associated with smaller magnitudes of improvement in KCCQ at one year (p=0.067). The presence of peripheral vascular disease at pre-implant predicts a lower VAS score at one year (p=0.03). Demographic factors such as age, sex, and marital status at implant did not predict higher post implant quality of life by either VAS or KCCQ. Conclusion Existing non-cardiac comorbidities should be taken into consideration when assessing the health related quality of life benefit of LVAD implantation.","Patel, Dhrusti; Kelkar, Anita A.",Journal of Cardiac Failure,473,1

One of the main functions of vitamin D is the proper absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal track. Optimal vitamin D levels are mandatory for adequate calcium absorption and bone health. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of knowledge of vitamin D, calcium, and physical activity among Emirati and tourist adults in Abu Dhabi. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that took place in three different malls in Abu Dhabi and included Emirati and tourist adults. Participants were asked to fill in a questionnaire consisting of 32 questions. These included questions on vitamin D, calcium, supplement, and physical activity knowledge. Another section of the questionnaire included general information on age, sex, education, weight, and height. The collected data were statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics using IBM SPSS statistics for Windows version 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 147 adults, 113 were females and 34 males. The mean age, height, and weight were 27.9 ± 8.6 years, 162.7 ± 10.4 cm, and 66.5 ± 19.5 kg, respectively. Emiratis had statistically significant higher basic knowledge on vitamin D compared to tourists (44.9 vs 27.1%), respectively. More than 66% of the whole sample was aware that vitamin D deficiency can affect muscle strength, as well as that calcium may affect osteoporosis. In a multiple regression model to analyze the possible effects of other factors to knowledge, it was found that only age (Beta: 0.045, P < 0.014) and nationality (Beta: 0.750, P < 0.018) were independently and significantly associated to vitamin D.

Herein, we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning (ML), and free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate the differences in binding by the two viruses. Although only subtle differences were observed from the initial MD simulations of the two RBD–ACE2 complexes, ML identified the individual residues with the most distinctive ACE2 interactions, many of which have been highlighted in previous experimental studies. FEP calculations quantified the corresponding differences in binding free energies to ACE2, and examination of MD trajectories provided structural explanations for these differences. Lastly, the energetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations were studied, showing that the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 is increased by N501Y and E484K mutations but is slightly decreased by K417N.","Pavlova, Anna; Zhang, Zijian; Acharya, Atanu; Lynch, Diane L.; Pang, Yui Tik; Mou, Zhongyu; Parks, Jerry M.; Chipot, Chris; Gumbart, James C.",J Phys Chem Lett,473,1

It is a problem that has been given the highest priority, uniting nations in the fight against its causes and effects. Among the actions that have been implemented are: clinical and microbiological surveillance, promotion of rational and controlled use of antibiotics, AMR stewardship programs in hospitals, development of tools for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases to establish prompt and adequate treatment, and radically improving vaccination strategies. The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed disproportionate demands on the healthcare infrastructure and economy worldwide, which will negatively impact on the availability of materials as well as the technical capacity for diagnosis, patient care, and treatment of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Disruptions to production and distribution chains will hamper the availability and usage of antibiotics, also interrupting several of the activities that have been implemented thus far to combat AMR, including detailed laboratory monitoring and reinforced vaccination programs.

One of the disadvantages of the Silver Stain Plus kit is its variable staining of glycoproteins as tested with several model samples, including hen egg white proteins, α1-acid glycoprotein and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. One of the advantages of silver staining is its ability to stain nucleic acids as demonstrated here for a model nucleic acid with two kits. It was then used to monitor the removal of nucleic acids from the affinity-purified maltose binding protein and monoclonal antibody. It also worked well on staining proteins on agarose gels prepared in the vertical mode, although preparation of the vertical agarose gels required technological modifications described in this report.

Schools were closed and contact with other people was limited. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we aimed to investigate the mental/social health of children/adolescents during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Two representative samples of Dutch children/adolescents (8–18 years) before COVID-19 (2018, N = 2401) and during lockdown (April 2020, N = 844) were compared on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: global health, peer relationships, anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger, sleep-related impairment by linear mixed models and calculating relative risks (RR (95% CI)) for the proportion of severe scores. Variables associated with worse mental/social health during COVID-19 were explored through multivariable regression models. The impact of COVID-19 regulations on the daily life of children was qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS: Participants reported worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains during COVID-19 lockdown compared to before (absolute mean difference range 2.1–7.1 (95% CI 1.3–7.9). During lockdown, more children reported severe Anxiety (RR = 1.95 (1.55–2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (RR = 1.89 (1.29–2.78) and fewer children reported poor Global Health (RR = 0.36 (0.20–0.65)). Associated factors with worse mental/social health were single-parent family, ≥ three children in the family, negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A large majority (> 90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on daily life. CONCLUSION: This study showed that governmental regulations regarding lockdown pose a serious mental/social health threat on children/adolescents that should be brought to the forefront of political decision-making and mental healthcare policy, intervention, and prevention.","Luijten, Michiel A.

The sudden expansion in the need for inpatient and intensive care facilities raised concerns about optimal clinical management and resource allocation. Despite the pressing need for evidence to make context-specific decisions on COVID-19 management, evidence from South Africa remained limited. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of hospitalised adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness at Mthatha Regional Hospital (MRH), Eastern Cape. RESULTS: Of the 1814 patients tested for COVID-19 between 20 March 2020 and 31 July 2020 at MRH, two-thirds (65.4%) were female. About two-thirds (242) of the 392 patients (21.6%) who tested positive for this disease were hospitalised and one-third (150) were quarantined at home. The mean age of the patients tested for COVID-19 was 42.6 years and there was no difference between males and females. The mean age of hospitalised patients was 55.5 years and the mean age of hospitalised patients who died (61.3 years) was much higher than recovered (49.5 years). Overall, 188 (77.6%) hospitalised patients had clinical comorbidity on admission. Diabetes (36.8%) and hypertension (33.1%) were the most common comorbidities amongst COVID-19 hospitalised patients. CONCLUSION: The majority of the patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19 were elderly and had high baseline comorbidities. Advance age and underlying comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension and HIV) were associated with high mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.","Kaswa, Ramprakash; Yogeswaran, Parimalaranie; Cawe, Busisiwe",S Afr Fam Pract (2004),473,27

Our research objective was to understand temporal trends in racial/ethnic variation in severity of COVID-19 illness presenting over time. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using longitudinal data from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a high-volume health system in Southern California. We studied patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 illness from 4 March 2020 through 5 December 2020. Our primary outcome was COVID-19 severity of illness among hospitalised patients, assessed by racial/ethnic group status. We defined overall illness severity as an ordinal outcome: hospitalisation but no intensive care unit (ICU) admission; admission to the ICU but no intubation; and intubation or death. RESULTS: A total of 1584 patients with COVID-19 with available demographic and clinical data were included. Hispanic/Latinx compared with non-Hispanic white patients had higher odds of experiencing more severe illness among hospitalised patients (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.22) and this disparity persisted over time. During the initial 2 months of the pandemic, non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to suffer severe illness than non-Hispanic whites (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.78); this disparity improved by May, only to return later in the pandemic. CONCLUSION: In our patient sample, the severity of observed COVID-19 illness declined steadily over time, but these clinical improvements were not seen evenly across racial/ethnic groups; greater illness severity continues to be experienced among Hispanic/Latinx patients.","Ebinger, Joseph E; Driver, Matthew; Ji, Hongwei; Claggett, Brian; Wu, Min; Luong, Eric; Sun, Nancy; Botting, Patrick; Kim, Elizabeth H; Hoang, Amy; Nguyen, Trevor Trung; Diaz, Jacqueline; Park, Eunice; Davis, Tod; Hussain, Shehnaz; Cheng, Susan; Figueiredo, Jane C",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,473,10

RECENT FINDINGS: Many studies have shown that axSpA patients - both patients in their nonradiological and radiological stage - respond similarly well to biologic treatment and these patients should be seen as having the same disease at different stages. AxSpA respond best to TNF-blocker - and probably also to other biologics - if the disease duration is short and if objective parameters of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein or MRI are positive. Primary aim of treatment is to reach and maintain clinical remission. Once remission is achieved, it can be maintained by continuing treatment, and in a proportion of yet not well defined patients the drug dose can be reduced without inducing a flare. The recent demonstration of a good efficacy, in addition to TNF blockers, also of IL-17 inhibitors and JAK-inhibitors in axSpA patients raises the question how to select the best patients for the best treatment. Radiographic progression can best be stopped by effectively suppressing inflammation, whether different drugs have here a different effect has still to be defined. More sensitive measurements of radiographic progression are urgently needed. SUMMARY: Reaching and maintaining clinical remission and preventing structural bony damage is the primary treatment target in patients with axSpA. How to reach this aim best has to be further explored in the future.","Sieper, Joachim; Poddubnyy, Denis",Curr Opin Rheumatol,473,1

The present study aims to explore the recognition of OCD, general knowledge about this disorder, implications in the classroom, and stigmatizing attitudes among teachers, as well as the effectiveness of a brief educational intervention about OCD. Participants (n = 95; mean age = 43. 29 years old; 64.3% female) were primary and secondary school teachers who were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group. All of them completed a set of self-report questionnaires, read an educational fact sheet (either about OCD in the experimental group or about a healthy diet in the control group), and again completed the questionnaires. Results show that prior to the intervention, most of the teachers identified the contamination and order OCD symptoms described in a vignette as specific to OCD (82.1%) and would recommend talking about the problem (98.9%) and seeking help (94.7%). However, only a few (36.8%) knew about the most effective OCD treatments or identified compulsions as a main OCD symptom (33%). Moreover, only about half of the teachers correctly identified OCD's possible interference in classroom routines, such as delays to achieve perfection or concentration problems, and strategies for dealing with OCD, such as continuing with the class rhythm. Stigma levels were from low to moderate. After the brief educational intervention, participants in the experimental group increased their knowledge about OCD, improved their strategies for managing a student with OCD symptoms, and had fewer stigmatizing attitudes associated with pity (p < 0.05). These changes were not observed in the control group. We can conclude that this brief and easy-to-administer intervention is an effective educational intervention to significantly improve teachers' knowledge and attitudes, at least in the short-term. These results are especially relevant because OCD is associated with high interference and long delays in seeking treatment, and teachers have a unique opportunity to help with prevention, early identification, and recommending an adequate intervention for OCD.","Chaves, Antonio; Arnáez, Sandra; Roncero, María; García-Soriano, Gemma",Front Psychiatry,473,13

South Africa has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Africa and understanding the country's disease trajectory is important for government policy makers to plan the optimal COVID-19 intervention strategy. The number of cases is highly correlated with the number of COVID-19 tests undertaking. Thus, current methods of understanding the COVID-19 transmission process in the country based only on the number of cases can be misleading. In light of this, we propose to estimate both the probability of positive cases per tests conducted (the positive testing rate) and the rate in which the positive testing rate changes over time (its derivative) using a flexible semi-parametric model. We applied the method to the observed positive testing rate in South Africa with data obtained from March 5th to September 2nd 2020. We found that the positive testing rate was declining from early March when the disease was first observed until early May where it kept on increasing. In the month of July 2020, the infection reached its peak then its started to decrease again indicating that the intervention strategy is effective. From mid August, 2020, the rate of change of the positive testing rate indicates that decline in the positive testing rate is slowing down, suggesting that a less effective intervention is currently implemented","Owokotomo, O.

The transition from stable phase to attractor phase happens after 13 days i.e.; it takes nearly a fortnight for the spread to randomize among people. Further, the pandemic transmission remains in the attractor phase for a very long time if no control measures are taken up. The attractor-source phase continues up to 385 days i.e., more than a year, and perhaps stabilizes on 386(th) day as per the Lyapunov exponent's analysis. The time series helps to know the period of the Virus's survival in the open sources i.e. markets, open spaces and various other carriers of the Virus if not quarantined or sanitized. The Virus cease to exist in around 60 days if it does not find any carrier or infect more places, people etc. The changes in LCEs of all variables as time progresses for around 400 days have been forecasted. It can be observed that phase trajectories indicate how the two variables interact with each other and affect the overall system's dynamics. It has been observed that for exposed and asymptomatically infected (y-z), as exposed ones (y) change from 0 to 100 the value of asymptomatically infected (z) increased upto around 58, at exposed ones (y) =100, asymptomatically infected (z) has two values as 58 and 10 i.e. follows bifurcation and as exposed ones (y) changes values upto 180, the value of asymptomatically infected (z) decreases to 25 so for exposed ones (y) from 100 to 180, asymptomatically infected (z) varies from 58 to 25 to 10 follows bifurcation. Also, phase structures of exposed-symptomatically infected (y-u), exposed-removed (y-v), exposed-virus in the reservoir (y-w), asymptomatically infected-removed (z-v), symptomatically infected-removed (u-v) specifically depict bifurcations in various forms at different points. In case of asymptomatically infected-virus in the reservoir (z-w), at asymptomatically infected (z)= 10, the value of viruses in the reservoir (w) = 50, then as asymptomatically infected (z) increases to upto around 60. At this point, removed ones (v) increase from 50 to 70 and asymptomatically infected (z) decrease to 20 i.e., crosses the same value twice, which shows its limiting is known as limit cycle behavior and both the values tend to decrease towards zero. It shows a closed-loop limit cycle. Today, there has been no scientific revolution in the development of vaccination, nor has any antiviral treatment been successful, resulting in lack of its medication. Based on the phases, time series, and complexity analysis of the model's various parameters, it is studied to understand the variation in this pandemic's scenario.","Sharma, Sunil Kumar; Bangia, Aashima; Alshehri, Mohammed; Bhardwaj, Rashmi",J Infect Public Health,473,16

METHODS: 91 healthcare professionals confirmed with the COVID-19 infection were collected, and clinical characteristics and epidemiological data were evaluated. RESULTS: Among the cases, 77 cases (84.6%) were confirmed by the viral nucleic acid test, and the other 14 cases were diagnosed by the clinical investigation. Ground glass opacity and bilateral shadows distribution were observed in 78 cases (85.6%). 56 cases (61.5%) were admitted into Zhongnan Hospital and subjected to antiviral treatment. 73 of a total of 91 cases (80.2%) with a median incubation period of 3 days (IQR, 2 to 6) reported close contact history with patients with the COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (66 cases, 72.5%) and cough (54 cases, 59.3%). The initial positive rate of the CT scan and RT-PCR assay were 84.6% and 48.4%, respectively (P < 0.01). There were 50 cases occurred during the early stage (before Jan 20, 2020), whereas 41 cases occurred at a late stage (after Jan 20, 2020). In the early stage, the most common route of exposure to COVID-19 was via direct care in the absence of any invasive procedure. By contrast, 37 healthcare professionals infected with COVID-19 in the late stage were confirmed to have been exposed via aerosol-generating procedures. CONCLUSION: Identification of the asymptomatic individuals in healthcare settings and prompt response when a suspicious case is considered may render effective control of the nosocomial infection during this pandemic.","Qi, Baiwen; Peng, Haiheng; Shou, Kangquan; Pan, Zhengyu; Zhou, Min; Li, Rui; Deng, Liping; Shen, Jun; Rao, Xin; Yu, Aixi",Biomed Res Int,473,1

Among animal-derived products, equine formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix) viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content, final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80 times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials. The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.","León, Guillermo; Herrera, María; Vargas, Mariángela; Arguedas, Mauricio; Sánchez, Andrés; Segura, Álvaro; Gómez, Aarón; Solano, Gabriela; Corrales-Aguilar, Eugenia; Risner, Kenneth; Narayanan, Aarthi; Bailey, Charles; Villalta, Mauren; Hernández, Andrés; Sánchez, Adriana; Cordero, Daniel; Solano, Daniela; Durán, Gina; Segura, Eduardo; Cerdas, Maykel; Umaña, Deibid; Moscoso, Edwin; Estrada, Ricardo; Gutiérrez, Jairo; Méndez, Marcos; Castillo, Ana Cecilia; Sánchez, Laura; Gutiérrez, José María; Díaz, Cecilia; Alape, Alberto",bioRxiv,473,1

The virus uses ACE2 receptor for viral entry. ACE2 is part of the counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is also expressed in the lower respiratory tract along the alveolar epithelium. There is, however, significant controversy regarding the role of ACE2 expression in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Some have argued that decreasing ACE2 expression would result in decreased susceptibility to the virus by decreasing available binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 and restricting viral entry into the cells. Others have argued that, like the pathogenesis of other viral pneumonias, including those stemming from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, once SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it downregulates ACE2 expression. Lack of the favourable effects of ACE2 might exaggerate lung injury by a variety of mechanisms. In order to help address this controversy, we conducted a literature search and review of relevant preclinical and clinical publications pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, ACE2, viral pneumonia, SARS, acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. Our review suggests, although controversial, that patients at increased susceptibility to COVID-19 complications may have reduced baseline ACE2, and by modulating ACE2 expression one can possibly improve COVID-19 outcomes. Herein, we elucidate why and how this potential mechanism might work.","Chaudhry, Farhan; Lavandero, Sergio; Xie, Xiang; Sabharwal, Basera; Zheng, Ying-Ying; Correa, Ashish; Narula, Jagat; Levy, Phillip",Open Heart,473,16

Despite its utility, uptake of telemedicine in EDs has varied. We studied characteristics associated with telemedicine adoption during a 4‐year period. METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2014 National Emergency Department Inventory (NEDI)–New England survey and follow‐up data from 2016 and 2017 NEDI‐USA and 2018 NEDI‐New England surveys, with data from the Center for Connected Health Policy. Among EDs not using telemedicine in 2014, we examined characteristics associated with adoption by 2018. RESULTS: Of the 159 New England EDs with available data, 80 (50%) and 125 (79%) reported telemedicine receipt in 2014 and 2018, respectively. Among the 79 EDs without telemedicine in 2014, academic EDs were less likely to adopt by 2018 (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.46). State policy environment was not associated with likelihood of adoption. In 2018, all 7 freestanding EDs received telemedicine, whereas only 1 of 9 academic EDs (11%) did. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine use by EDs continues to grow rapidly and by 2018, >3 quarters of EDs in our sample were receiving telemedicine. From 2014 to 2018, the initiation of telemedicine receipt was less common among higher volume and academic EDs.","Zachrison, Kori S.; Boggs, Krislyn M.; Hayden, Emily M.; Cash, Rebecca E.; Espinola, Janice A.; Samuels‐Kalow, Margaret E.; Sullivan, Ashley F.; Mehrotra, Ateev; Camargo, Carlos A.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,473,21

How results from different brief depression and anxiety symptom assessment tools compare to each other is not well established, especially in real world healthcare settings. This study aimed to compare the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 Depression scale (DASS-Depression) and Anxiety (DASS-Anxiety) scale to the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) respectively, in a real-world virtual behavioral healthcare setting. METHODS: This was a retrospective comparison study of clinical data from a population of adults who completed a consultation via telephone or secure video with a licensed therapist as part of a standardized, evidence-based, virtual behavioral therapy program for individuals with comorbid medical and behavioral health conditions. The joint distributions and correlations between scores yielded by each depression and anxiety scale were assessed using descriptive and Spearman correlation statistics. RESULTS: The DASS-Depression and PHQ-8 were highly correlated (r = .71; p=<.001); the DASS-Anxiety and GAD-7 correlation was also high (r = .61; p=<.001). The PHQ-8 categorized more individuals as having above-threshold depression scores versus the DASS-Depression (71.5% vs. 43.5%; p < .001). The GAD-7 categorized more individuals as having above-threshold anxiety scores versus the DASS-Anxiety (59.0% vs. 45.0%; p < .001). LIMITATIONS: This study compared results yielded by validated screeners, precluding conclusions related to the validity of screener results. CONCLUSIONS: The DASS-Depression and PHQ-8 and the DASS-Anxiety and GAD-7 similarly ranked symptom severity. The PHQ-8 and GAD-7 were more likely than the DASS-21 Depression or Anxiety scales to classify individuals as having above-threshold symptom severity.","Peters, Lila; Peters, Aimee; Andreopoulos, Evie; Pollock, Naomi; Pande, Reena L.; Mochari-Greenberger, Heidi",Heliyon,473,23

One example is SARS, which caused a worldwide health threat in 2003. In coronaviruses, the structural protein N (nucleocapsid protein) associates with the viral RNA to form the filamentous nucleocapsid and plays a crucial role in genome replication and transcription. The structure of Nterminal domain of MHV N protein also implicated its specific affinity with transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) RNA. Here we report the crystal structures of the two proteolytically resistant N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains of the N protein from murine hepatitis virus (MHV). The structure of NTD in two different crystal forms was solved to 1.5 Å. The higher resolution provides more detailed structural information than previous reports, showing that the NTD structure from MHV shares a similar overall and topology structure with that of SARS-CoV and IBV, but varies in its potential surface, which indicates a possible difference in RNA-binding module. The structure of CTD was solved to 2.0-Å resolution and revealed a tightly intertwined dimer. This is consistent with analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, suggesting a dimeric assembly of the N protein. The similarity between the structures of these two domains from SARS-CoV, IBV and MHV corroborates a conserved mechanism of nucleocapsid formation for coronaviruses.","Ma, Yanlin; Tong, Xiaohang; Xu, Xiaoling; Li, Xuemei; Lou, Zhiyong; Rao, Zihe",Protein & Cell,473,30

Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wastewater has to-date relied on genomic sequencing, which lacks sensitivity necessary to detect low variant abundances in diluted and mixed wastewater samples. Here, we develop and present an open-source method based on allele specific RT-qPCR (AS RT-qPCR) that detects and quantifies the B.1.1.7 variant, targeting spike protein mutations at three independent genomic loci highly predictive of B.1.1.7 (HV69/70del, Y144del, and A570D). Our assays can reliably detect and quantify low levels of B.1.1.7 with low cross-reactivity, and at variant proportions between 0.1% and 1% in a background of mixed SARS-CoV-2. Applying our method to wastewater samples from the United States, we track B.1.1.7 occurrence over time in 19 communities. AS RT-qPCR results align with clinical trends, and summation of B.1.1.7 and wild-type sequences quantified by our assays strongly correlate with SARS-CoV-2 levels indicated by the US CDC N1/N2 assay. This work paves the path for rapid inexpensive surveillance of B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater.","Lee, W. L.; McElroy, K.
