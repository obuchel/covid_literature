Common allergy clinic procedures, including oral food challenges and subcutaneous immunotherapy, carry a risk of anaphylaxis, the treatment for which is epinephrine. Our goal was to develop a standardized process for the management and documentation of allergic reactions that occur in a tertiary care pediatric allergy clinic. METHODS: This was a single institution quality improvement pilot study. A multidisciplinary team from the allergy department designed, implemented, and studied the use of a standardized form for the documentation and treatment of allergic reactions within the clinic. RESULTS: A standardized form was developed based on evidence-based guidelines for the management of allergic reactions and included space for documentation. Both clinic providers and staff approved the form. One year after the introduction, we reached 100% adherence for the use of the form in visits during which a patient experienced a severe allergic reaction requiring epinephrine. Two patients required transfer to the emergency room; the quality improvement form was utilized in these cases to document treatment and assist with the hand-off to emergency room personnel before transfer. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a standardized form for the treatment and documentation of anaphylaxis within our allergy clinic. The next steps focus on further integrating this form into the electronic medical record, determining compliance with evidence-based management of anaphylaxis, and formally assessing the use of the form as a handoff tool in the event of patient transfer.","Kraft, Monica T.; Scherzer, Rebecca; Strothman, Kasey; Rogers, Gayla; Montgomery, Tricia; Grayson, Mitchell H.",Pediatr Qual Saf,602,1

Our critical care transport team performs over 1,800 interfacility nonemergency medical services transports annually into a dense urban environment. Historically, we have utilized lights and sirens to navigate traffic patterns. The use exceeded industry standards. This quality improvement project was undertaken to decrease the use of lights and sirens. METHODS/RESULTS: The baseline use of lights and sirens in 2011 was 76% en route and 73% on return to the facility. We revised the internal policy guiding the appropriate usage of lights and sirens. In 2012, without an improvement in usage, a use justification process was implemented. By 2013, the use of lights and sirens was still high en route, but had decreased to 53% on the return trip. In 2014, we added accountability measures requiring justification, with a subsequent drop in 2015 to 14% en route and 13% on return. In the following 3 years, the transport teams have sustained lights and sirens use to 20% or below. CONCLUSIONS: This quality improvement initiative impacted team behavior and decreased the use of lights and sirens over 5 years, with sustained improvement at or below 20%. This improvement was accomplished through ongoing evaluation, education, data gathering, and open communication. There was no negative impact on patient outcomes during this time. Lights and sirens continue to be used when indicated.","Westley, Laura; Nokes, Janice; Rozenfeld, Ranna A.",Pediatr Qual Saf,602,1

Thus, single-cell data have a hierarchical structure that many current single-cell methods do not address, leading to biased inference, highly inflated type 1 error rates, and reduced robustness and reproducibility. This includes methods that use a batch effect correction for individual as a means of accounting for within-sample correlation. Here, we document this dependence across a range of cell types and show that pseudo-bulk aggregation methods are conservative and underpowered relative to mixed models. To compute differential expression within a specific cell type across treatment groups, we propose applying generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for individual, to properly account for both zero inflation and the correlation structure among measures from cells within an individual. Finally, we provide power estimates across a range of experimental conditions to assist researchers in designing appropriately powered studies.","Zimmerman, Kip D.; Espeland, Mark A.; Langefeld, Carl D.",Nat Commun,602,17

Here, we report a robust protocol for the isolation, maintenance and differentiation of rabbit small intestinal organoids and organoid-derived cell monolayers. Our rabbit intestinal spheroid and monolayer cultures grew most efficiently in L-WRN-conditioned medium that contained Wnt, R-spondin and Noggin, and that had been supplemented with ROCK and TGF-β inhibitors. Organoid and monolayer differentiation was initiated by reducing the concentration of the L-WRN-conditioned medium and by adding ROCK and Notch signalling inhibitors. Immunofluorescence staining and RT-qPCR demonstrated that our organoids contained enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, goblet cells and Paneth cells. Finally, we infected rabbit organoids with Rabbit calicivirus Australia-1, an enterotropic lagovirus that—like many other caliciviruses—does not grow in conventional cell culture. Despite testing various conditions for inoculation, we did not detect any evidence of virus replication, suggesting either that our organoids do not contain suitable host cell types or that additional co-factors are required for a productive infection of rabbit organoids with Rabbit calicivirus Australia-1.","Kardia, Egi; Frese, Michael; Smertina, Elena; Strive, Tanja; Zeng, Xi-Lei; Estes, Mary; Hall, Robyn N.",Sci Rep,602,16

Electromagnetic fields (EMFs), used as a physiotherapy for bone defects, have been suspected to cause potential hazards to human health due to the long-term exposure. To optimize the application of EMF while avoiding its adverse effects, a combination of EMF and tissue engineering techniques is critical. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of EMF will lead to better applications in the future. METHODS: In this research, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) seeded on 3D-printed scaffolds were treated with sinusoidal EMFs in vitro. Then, 5.5 mm critical-sized calvarial defects were created in rats, and the cell scaffolds were implanted into the defects. In addition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which EMFs regulate BMSCs were explored with various approaches to gain deeper insight into the effects of EMFs. RESULTS: The cell scaffolds treated with EMF successfully accelerated the repair of critical-sized calvarial defects. Further studies revealed that EMF could not directly induce the differentiation of BMSCs but improved the sensitivity of BMSCs to BMP signals by upregulating the quantity of specific BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) receptors. Once these receptors receive BMP signals from the surrounding milieu, a cascade of reactions is initiated to promote osteogenic differentiation via the BMP/Smad signalling pathway. Moreover, the cytokines secreted by BMSCs treated with EMF can better facilitate angiogenesis and osteoimmunomodulation which play fundamental roles in bone regeneration. CONCLUSION: In summary, EMF can promote the osteogenic potential of BMSCs and enhance the paracrine function of BMSCs to facilitate bone regeneration. These findings highlight the profound impact of EMF on tissue engineering and provide a new strategy for the clinical treatment of bone defects.","Li, Weigang; Liu, Wenbin; Wang, Wei; Wang, Jiachen; Ma, Tian; Chen, Jingyuan; Wu, Hua; Liu, Chaoxu",Stem Cell Res Ther,602,7

Optogenetics offers new possibilities for this. Preliminary experiments show that sub-threshold illumination affects electrical wave propagation in the mouse heart. However, a systematic exploration of these effects is technically challenging. Here, we use state-of-the-art computer models to study the dynamic control of spiral waves in a two-dimensional model of the adult mouse ventricle, using stationary and non-stationary patterns of sub-threshold illumination. Our results indicate a light-intensity-dependent increase in cellular resting membrane potentials, which together with diffusive cell-cell coupling leads to the development of spatial voltage gradients over differently illuminated areas. A spiral wave drifts along the positive gradient. These gradients can be strategically applied to ensure drift-induced termination of a spiral wave, both in optogenetics and in conventional methods of electrical defibrillation.","Hussaini, Sayedeh; Venkatesan, Vishalini; Biasci, Valentina; Romero Sepúlveda, José M; Quiñonez Uribe, Raul A; Sacconi, Leonardo; Bub, Gil; Richter, Claudia; Krinski, Valentin; Parlitz, Ulrich; Majumder, Rupamanjari; Luther, Stefan",,602,1

The pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic model based on the steady-state hypothesis was used to explain TMP degradation behavior in UV-activated persulfate system. Due to the low quantum yield and molar absorptivity of TMP at 254 nm, the direct photolysis of TMP was slower. Since the free radicals generated by adding H(2)O(2) or PS to the system can react with TMP, the degradation rate was significantly accelerated, and[Formula: see text] played a dominant role in the UV/PS system. [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were determined by the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetic model to be 6.02×10(9) and 3.88×10(9) M(−1)s(−1), respectively. The values were consistent with competitive kinetic measurements. The pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics model can predict and explain the effect of PS concentration, natural organic matter, and chloride ion on the TMP degradation in the UV/PS system. The observed pseudo first-order rate constants for TMP degradation (k(obs)) increased with the persulfate concentration, but it significantly decreased in the presence of NOM and chloride. [Formula: see text] has no effect on the degradation of TMP, while [Formula: see text] promotes the degradation and [Formula: see text] inhibits the degradation. The common transition metal ion (such as Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Co(2+)) in industrial wastewater has a synergistic effect on the TMP degradation in the UV/PS system, but excessive metal ions will lead to a decrease of the degradation rate.","Luo, Yiting; Su, Rongkui; Yao, Haisong; Zhang, Aoshan; Xiang, Siyuan; Huang, Lei",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,602,12

Method: Three-hundred-and-fifty-two patients with chronic tinnitus completed audiological testing and a psychological assessment battery that comprised—among other measures—German versions of the Tinnitus Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Somatic Symptom Scale-8, and Health-Related Quality of Life scale. Descriptive analyses examined associations as well as within- and between-gender differences of the measured variables. Gender-specific serial indirect effects analyses aimed to explain the impact of TRD on HRQoL through psychological processes, notably anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatization symptoms. Results: Both female and male patients yielded lower mental than physical HRQoL and negative associations between the measured psychological variables and HRQoL. Compared to male patients, female patients reported higher levels of tinnitus-related- and wider psychological distress, other somatization symptoms (e.g., headaches), and impairments in mental and physical HRQoL. For each gender, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and somatization symptoms fully mediated the effect of TRD on mental and physical HRQoL. A double-dissociation revealed an interaction of somatization symptoms and depression on the TRD-HRQoL association in women, and of somatization symptoms and anxiety in men. Conclusions: In patients with chronic tinnitus, psychological constructs account for reported impairments in both mental and physical HRQoL. To improve patients’ HRQoL, treatment conceptualizations should consider gender-specific psychological expressions of low mood or anxiety.","Boecking, Benjamin; Biehl, Raphael; Brueggemann, Petra; Mazurek, Birgit",J Clin Med,602,12

According to the German Medical Licensure Act, physicians having completed their qualification in another country are required to pass a knowledge examination which falls within the competence of examination offices or the regional governments. Project outline: The preparatory course consists of 10 modules. On Fridays, individual cases are discussed in small groups and specific examination techniques are trained. On Saturdays, illnesses are simulated by simulated patients. After each encounter, faculty experts, psychologists and peer group members provide the participants with 360° feedback. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course which had been established 2 years beforehand has now been switched to an online class within one week. Friday units were visualized in power-point presentations and tutorial videos were discussed. On Saturdays, the cases were simulated by simulated patients and transmitted via a telemedicine platform. Results: The course could be conducted without interruptions (75 hours of in-class tuition and 75 hours of online tuition). In the oral evaluation the participants criticized telemedicine as a medium for imparting of practical skills. 7/22 (32%) of the participants underwent the knowledge examination and 6/7 (86%) of them passed it (versus 18/19 of the participants of in-class tuition (95%)). Discussion: There was a clear preference for in-class tuition. It was noted that the telemedical setting entailed some restrictions. However, the switch to online classes did not affect the pass rate. Conclusion: The switch from in-class to online units was feasible. The gained insights were taken into account when conceiving the online semester at our faculty and especially the tuition with the support of simulated patients.","Shomanova, Zornitsa; Ahrens, Helmut; dos Santos, Tanja; Sensmeier, Janina; Kurpat, Rahel; Schnase, Maike; Yildirim, Kemal; Marschall, Bernhard",GMS J Med Educ,602,1

Inadequate or delayed restoration of diarrheal losses results in a very high incidence of AKI. Diarrheal illness is a major reason for hospitalization, but data on consequent acute kidney injury are sparse. The objective of the study is to determine the incidence of AKI in infectious and noninfectious diarrheal illness requiring hospitalization and to identify correlates and outcomes of diarrhea-associated AKI. None of the patients had any organism isolated in stool, probably due to prompt initiation of antibiotics/inadequate culture growth. Three out of our 6 cases did not require hemodialysis (HD) and AKI resolved on conservative management alone (fluids, electrolyte management, and antibiotics). Three out of 6 cases had nonresolving AKI and were dependent on renal replacement therapy (RRT) even at 1 month after discharge as they remained oliguric. One recent paper has reported the recovery of renal function after a period of dialysis. Frequent electrolyte abnormalities, risk of (catheter-related/bloodstream) infections, and severity of the primary disease are the chief reasons for the persistently high morbidity.

Two types of photocurable resins are reinforced by titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) or zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles with average diameters in the 10–30 nm range to provide antimicrobial properties. The developed nanocomposites can be additively manufactured using the digital light processing method with an outstanding surface quality and precise geometrical accuracy. Experimental characterizations are conducted to investigate key mechanical properties of the 3D printed nanocomposites, including Young’s Modulus, tensile strength, and abrasion resistance. Specimens produced were observed to demonstrate the following characteristics during testing. Tensile strength increased by 42.2% at a maximum value of 29.53 MPa. The modulus of elasticity increased by 14.3%, and abrasion resistance increased by 15.8%. The proper dispersion of the nanoparticles within the cured resin is validated by scanning electron images. The wettability and water absorption testing results indicate that the developed nanocomposites have an outstanding water resistance capability. The pairing of digital light processing with these novel nanocomposites allows for the creation of complex composite geometries that are not capable through other manufacturing processes. Therefore, they have the potential for long-term usage to improve general public health with antimicrobial functionality. The pairing of an unmodified photocurable resin with a 1% ZnO concentration demonstrated the most promise for commercial applications.","Billings, Christopher; Cai, Changjie; Liu, Yingtao",Polymers (Basel),602,1

Thus, efforts are put forth in developing novel immunotherapeutic agents targeting cancer-testis antigens (CTA) in NSCLC. This work utilized reverse vaccinology approach in designing a novel multi-epitope vaccine targeting melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGEA3), MAGEA4, New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO-1), and Kita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen 1 (KK-LC1), being the most frequently expressed CTAs in NSCLC. METHODS: Epitopes were mapped from the sequences of CTAs. The population coverage (PC) of identified CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes were estimated. Candidate linear B cell (BL), CD4+, and CD8+ epitopes were adjoined in a multi-epitope construct (Mvax) with flagellin domain as an adjuvant. Antigenicity, and cross-reactivity of Mvax were examined. The tertiary structure of Mvax was modelled, and validated. All epitopes included in the vaccine were docked with their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binders. The immunogenicity of epitopes in Mvax was validated through molecular dynamics analysis. RESULTS: Mvax contains 22 epitopes from MAGEA3, MAGEA4, NY-ESO-1, and KK-LC1. It is classified as antigenic, non-allergen, non-toxic, and possesses physicochemical stability. Epitopes have no significant hits with other human proteins, except for 2 other CTAs frequently expressed in NSCLC. The stretch of BL epitopes in Mvax confers flexibility, and accessibility emphasizing its antigenicity. The tertiary structure analysis showed that Mvax model has good structural quality. All epitopes included in the vaccine are highly immunogenic as indicated by favorable binding affinity, low binding energy, and acceptable root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes have global PC of 81.81%, and 84.15%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, in silico evaluations show that Mvax is a potential immunotherapeutic agent against NSCLC.","Herrera, Leana Rich M.",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,602,1

This work describes the isolation and characterization of llama-derived Nanobodies (Nbs) recognizing the major viral viroplasm component, P9-1. Specific Nbs were selected against recombinant P9-1, with affinities in the nanomolar range as measured by surface plasmon resonance. Three selected Nbs were fused to alkaline phosphatase and eGFP to develop a sandwich ELISA test which showed a high diagnostic sensitivity (99.12%, 95% CI 95.21–99.98) and specificity (100%, 95% CI 96.31–100) and a detection limit of 0.236 ng/ml. Interestingly, these Nanobodies recognized different P9-1 conformations and were successfully employed to detect P9-1 in pull-down assays of infected maize extracts. Finally, we demonstrated that fusions of the Nbs to eGFP and RFP allowed the immunodetection of virus present in phloem cells of leaf thin sections. The Nbs developed in this work will aid the study of MRCV epidemiology, assist maize breeding programs, and be valuable tools to boost fundamental research on viroplasm structure and maturation.","Llauger, Gabriela; Monti, Demián; Adúriz, Matías; Romão, Ema; Dumón, Analía Delina; Mattio, María Fernanda; Wigdorovitz, Andrés; Muyldermans, Serge; Vincke, Cécile; Parreño, Viviana; del Vas, Mariana",Sci Rep,602,1

Here, discrepancies between analytical approaches and numerical results regarding the finite-size scaling of the epidemic threshold are a crucial open issue in the literature. We find that the scaling exponent assumes a nontrivial value during a long preasymptotic regime. We calculate this value, finding good agreement with numerical evidence. We also show that the crossover to the true asymptotic regime occurs for sizes much beyond currently feasible simulations. Our findings allow us to rationalize and reconcile all previously published results (both analytical and numerical), thus ending a long-standing debate.","Castellano, Claudio; Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo",,602,1

The pandemic provides a unique opportunity to investigate the utility of telemedicine in the evaluation and management of spinal pathology. METHODS: An 11-part telemedicine questionnaire was developed to assess the above parameters for all patients seen via telemedicine by three neurosurgeons within a 3-week period. Patients were called by phone to participate in the survey. Chi square and ANOVA were performed to determine significance. RESULTS: 200 patients were called for the survey. 153 patients responded. 95% of patients were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their telemedicine visit, with 58% of patients stating their visit was “the same” or “better” than previous in-person appointments. On average, patients saved 154 minutes by using telemedicine compared to patient reported in-person visit times. 71% of employed patients have to take off work for in-person visits, compared to just 3% of employed patients who take off work for telemedicine. 42% of patients would feel comfortable proceeding with surgery and 81% of patients would feel comfortable proceeding with a minor procedure (i.e. injection) based off of a telemedicine visit alone. 39% of patients preferred telemedicine to an in-person visit. Patients were separated into three cohorts: those who preferred telemedicine, those who would have preferred an in-clinic visit, and those with no preference. There were no statistically significant differences between these groups in sex, age, or new vs. established patients. After excluding one outlier, patients who preferred telemedicine had significantly longer patient reported in-person visit times (212min) compared to patients who preferred in-person visits (169min) and those who had no preference (119min), P = .008. CONCLUSION: Our results show that patients are not only satisfied with telemedicine visits, but some patients may prefer them to traditional in-person visits. Further studies are indicated to determine which patients may be appropriate candidates for telemedicine evaluation and management.","Greven, Alex C.M; McGinley, Beau; Malcolm, James G; Boden, Scott D; Rodts, Gerald E; Refai, Daniel; Gary, Matthew F",Neurosurgery,602,1

The decisive policy that ended this crisis was the Outright Monetary Transactions policy. Besides, the quantitative easing policy supports the economy of the euro area after this crisis. To examine the impact of these supranational monetary policies on the business cycles in the euro area, which is not covered by optimum currency area theory, we use a Kaldorian two-country model featuring a monetary union and imperfect capital mobility. We find that an increase in government bond purchases is a stabilizing factor, whereas an extreme increase in the degree of counter-cyclical fiscal policy is a destabilizing factor. Nevertheless, as long as the fiscal and monetary policies of two countries are not extremely active, but active to a certain extent, the equilibrium point becomes locally stable. Furthermore, even if the business cycles are not synchronized, the purchase of government bonds of a particular country is effective in stabilizing the business cycles of both countries. From these results, we suggest that the euro area satisfies the metacriteria of an optimum currency area through the implementation of a government bond purchase system by a supranational central bank system.","Nakao, Masato; Asada, Toichiro",Evolut Inst Econ Rev,602,16

Blockages of EIII-neutrophil interaction using cell-binding competitive inhibitor or selective Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors OLT1177 and Z-WHED-FMK can suppress EIII-induced NETosis response. These results collectively suggest that Nlrp3 inflammsome is a molecular target for treating dengue-elicited inflammatory pathogenesis.","Lien, Te-Sheng; Sun, Der-Shan; Hung, Shih-Che; Wu, Wen-Sheng; Chang, Hsin-Hou",Front Immunol,602,22

In this article, using anchoring to test validity in a randomized controlled survey experiment during the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrate that asking people to self-report on the frequency of routine behaviors are prone to significant measurement error and systematic bias. Specifically, we find that participants across age, gender, and political allegiance report higher (lower) frequencies of COVID-19-relevant behaviors when provided with a higher (lower) anchor. The results confirm that such self-reports should not be regarded as behavioral data and should primarily be used to inform policy decisions if better alternatives are not available. To this end, we discuss the use of anchoring as a validity test relative to self-reported behaviors as well as viable alternatives to self-reports when seeking to behaviorally inform policy decisions.","Hansen, Pelle Guldborg; Larsen, Erik Gahner; Gundersen, Caroline Drøgemüller",,602,24

We advance the literature theoretically by arguing two points. First, we assert that incarceration is a potent structural driver of health inequalities that must be considered as a fundamental social cause of disease. To underscore this point, we review how incarceration meets each of the four fundamental social cause criteria originally proposed by Link and Phelan. Second, given that incarceration is a fundamental social cause of disease, both currently and formerly incarcerated populations are likely to face heightened vulnerabilities to pandemics, including COVID-19, further exacerbating health disparities among incarceration-exposed groups.","Novisky, Meghan A; Nowotny, Kathryn M; Jackson, Dylan B; Testa, Alexander; Vaughn, Michael G",Br J Criminol,602,1

Several methods have been proposed for COVID-19 case predictions but they have important limitations in terms of model interpretability, related to COVID-19’s incubation period and major trends of disease transmission. To be able to explain prediction results in terms of incubation period and transmission trends, this paper presents the Multivariate Shapelet Learning (MSL) model to learn shapelets from historical observations in multiple areas. An experimental evaluation was done to compare the prediction performance of eleven algorithms, using the data collected from 50 US provinces/states. Results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient. The learned shapelets explain increasing and decreasing trends of new confirmed cases, and reveal that the COVID-19 incubation period in the USA is around 28 days.","Wang, Zhijin; Cai, Bing",Appl Intell,602,24

The emergence of artificial bone scaffolds provides an attractive solution. In this work, a new biomineralization strategy is proposed to facilitate osteogenesis through sustaining supply of nutrients including phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and silicon (Si). We developed black phosphorus (BP)-based, three-dimensional nanocomposite fibrous scaffolds via microfluidic technology to provide a wealth of essential ions for bone defect treatment. The fibrous scaffolds were fabricated from 3D poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibers (3D NFs), BP nanosheets, and hydroxyapatite (HA)-porous SiO(2) nanoparticles. The 3D BP@HA NFs possess three advantages: i) stably connected pores allow the easy entrance of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into the interior of the 3D fibrous scaffolds for bone repair and osteogenesis; ii) plentiful nutrients in the NFs strongly improve osteogenic differentiation in the bone repair area; iii) the photothermal effect of fibrous scaffolds promotes the release of elements necessary for bone formation, thus achieving accelerated osteogenesis. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that the 3D BP@HA NFs, with the assistance of NIR laser, exhibited good performance in promoting bone regeneration. Furthermore, microfluidic technology makes it possible to obtain high-quality 3D BP@HA NFs with low costs, rapid processing, high throughput and mass production, greatly improving the prospects for clinical application. This is also the first BP-based bone scaffold platform that can self-supply Ca(2+), which may be the blessedness for older patients with bone defects or patients with damaged bones as a result of calcium loss.","Li, Zhanrong; Zhang, Xingcai; Ouyang, Jiang; Chu, Dandan; Han, Fengqi; Shi, Liuqi; Liu, Ruixing; Guo, Zhihua; Gu, Grace X.; Tao, Wei; Jin, Lin; Li, Jingguo",Bioact Mater,602,32

Pharmacies sell some medical products which are kept in fridges. The opening and closing of the fridge while taking some medicine makes the outside hot air enter the fridge, which will increase the inner fridge temperature.

There are over 3.7 billion ehealth mobile app downloads per year. Weight loss apps offer information on exercise and nutrition as well as weight tracking. Obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, along with diabetes and hypertension. In addition, obesity plays a role in the increased mortality of COVID patients. In March of 2020, the U.S. government, through the Small Business Administration and through the Small Business Innovation Research program, as well as through Facebook and Google, offered individuals and companies money for public education and/or solutions for the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, are software app developers adding information about COVID-19 for their audience? Specifically, do weight loss apps mention obesity being a risk factor for DM, Hypertension, and COVID-19? Weight loss apps target a young demographic, and for public health purposes, COVID-19 information needs to reach this demographic since obesity can be a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. Purpose: Do weight loss apps provide information about DM, HTN, and COVID-19 during this pandemic era? Methods: Evaluation of the 10 most popular apps in the Apple (iOS) and Google (Android) stores via the search term “weight loss.” Apps were ranked by downloads/star rating respectively for Android and iOS apps. Apple does not provide information about the number of downloads. App inclusion criteria: 1) Free 2) iOS: star ratings greater than 4 (greater than 10K ratings); Android: greater than or equal to 1 Million downloads; App features: DM, HTN, Race, Gender, COVID-19, BMI, Heart Disease, Calorie Count, and Fitness. Results: DM: 0/20, HTN: 0/20, BMI: 19/20, while Race is 0/20; Gender 19/20; COVID-19: 0/20; Calorie Count 11/20; Fitness 13/20. Conclusion: 1) Weight Loss apps have not ventured in the public education realm of risk factors and comorbidities of COVID-19 despite the pandemic in 2020. 2) As physicians, we should continue to educate our patients with weight issues and other risk factors in the era of a worldwide pandemic.","Wu, Gloria; Nguyen, Brian; Lau, Chap-Kay Kendra; Siu, Vincent",J Endocr Soc,602,24

Lessons and Successes from The Transition Period,17.934834,6.542091,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may develop acute respiratory inflammation, due to an exaggerated immune response and some develop chronic complications. Neutrophils play a major role in the pathology of inflammatory diseases and have been shown to contribute to lung and vascular damage in COVID-19. Our aim was to establish a relationship between neutrophil phenotype and disease severity and to determine whether neutrophil abnormalities persist in convalescent patients. Methods Peripheral blood samples were obtained from acute COVID-19 patients (n = 74), follow-up (FU) patients discharged following inpatient admission (n = 56), a median of 87 days after discharge, and healthy controls (HCs, n = 22). Patients were stratified by disease severity based on inspired oxygen (FiO2) and admission to intensive care (ICU). Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood by negative selection for phenotyping and functional analysis. PBMC Isolation Tubes were used to quantify and phenotype low density neutrophils (LDNs) within the PBMC fraction. For quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, isolated neutrophils were incubated with a ROS reactive dye, DHR-123 and stimulated with PMA. All samples were stained and fixed prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Results There was a marked increase in neutrophils expressing the activation and degranulation markers, CD64 (P < 0.0001) and CD63 (P < 0.0001) and a reduction in neutrophils expressing the maturity markers, CD10 (P < 0.0005) and CD101 (P < 0.0005) in patients with acute COVID-19 compared to HCs. Increased frequency of neutrophils expressing CD64 (P < 0.005), CD63 (P < 0.01) and expressing decreased CD101 (P < 0.0001) were also detected in FU patients compared to HCs. Notably, 42.3 ± 4.4% of neutrophils were CD101(lo) in FU patients, compared to 29.0 ± 3.7% in acute patients and 9.6 ± 4.1% in HCs. These changes were most apparent in FU patients recovering from severe COVID-19 compared to mild or moderate disease. The frequency of LDNs in PBMCs from acute patients was significantly higher than HCs (P < 0.0001), and correlated with disease severity. Similarly, the frequency of LDNs in FU patients was significantly higher than in HCs (P < 0.0005). We found a trend towards higher basal ROS production in acute and FU patients, but a blunted response to PMA stimulated ROS production in neutrophils from acute patients versus HCs (P < 0.0001). Impaired ROS production persisted in FU patients compared to HCs (P < 0.01). Conclusion Circulating neutrophils in acute COVID-19 have an altered phenotype and comprise immature and activated cells. This altered phenotype persisted in convalescence and may contribute to the persistence of symptoms and an increased susceptibility to subsequent infections. Future work will aim to investigate the functional implications of these findings. Disclosure T.O. Williams: None. V. Kästele: None. E.R. Mann: None. S.B. Knight: None. M. Menon: None. C.

At BTHFT we benefited with all GP practices in the region using TPP SystmOne (S1) for medical records. We describe how we used S1 to help identify high risk patients under our care. Methods We did not appreciate the full extent we could use S1 to identify patients in our initial shielding identification process. As such, we reviewed notes of patients on biologic prescriptions and SC MTX from Homecare prescription lists. To capture patients on high dose prednisolone, we identified patients with a recent diagnosis of GCA and patients with recent prescriptions of > 20mg prednisolone through pharmacy records. On recognising the ability of S1 to identify patients that had glucocorticoid exposure through primary care and/or on cDMARDS we used S1 reporting mechanisms to identify these patients. Clinical record sharing enabled BTHFT’s rheumatology department to access S1 for all patients under their care. S1’s clinical reporting function was used to search for patients within at least one of the following cohorts before being combined in a single cohort of ‘at risk’ patients (heart, lung or kidney disease, ≥70 years, diabetes or hypertension [including pulmonary artery hypertension]). Reports were created for patients on any DMARD issued within primary care within the previous 12 weeks. High dose steroid use was more challenging to demonstrate, but a report was devised to include all patients with an issued prescription for prednisolone 5mg tablets within the preceding 8 weeks (for any reason). An additional report was created for patients with a rheumatological diagnosis co-existing with an interstitial lung disease. Using S1's report joining function, the different drugs and ‘at risk’ cohorts were combined to provide an accurate list of patients with features increasing their vulnerability to COVID-19. This list was easily modifiable and searches were re-run to update lists once inclusion on the shielding list was updated. Results Patients meeting the criteria for shielding were then advised in writing including signposting to BTHFT’s rheumatology website and helpline for further information if required. By searching for all prednisolone prescriptions, this would have included patients given prednisolone for other reasons. 5mg tablet strength ensured patients on low dose were excluded, but we recognise some patients were likely over-recruited into this cohort. Conclusion We can update our searching methods to easily include patients on biologics and SC MTX by some additional bulk coding in preparation for future shielding specifications thereby bypassing the need to review individual notes for patients. We were able to achieve an accurate shielding list in a relatively short space of time to reduce patient risk. Disclosure D. Kirby: None. K.

It also had the potential to alter self-management behaviours. These changes could in turn impact mental health, especially given that IA patients are already at higher risk of mental health disorders. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine how IA care and self-management were affected by lockdown and assess the impact of these changes on disease outcomes and mental health. Methods Online questionnaires were completed by 338 participants between June and July 2020. The questionnaires assessed demographics, IA condition, IA self-management, COVID-19 clinical information, quality of life, and mental health. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity, pain, fatigue, and emotional distress were completed relating to the previous week and retrospectively for pre-lockdown (March) and early-lockdown (April). Improvement/worsening in each VAS was considered as a change of 10 points or more from pre-lockdown to the current rating. Linear regressions were conducted to determine factors associated with worse outcomes, controlling for potential confounders including self-reported pre-lockdown status. Results Mean VAS scores worsened during lockdown for all outcome measures, with over half reporting a more than 10-point worsening (Table 1). Changes to clinical care affected 87% of patients. The most commonly affected services were hospital outpatient appointments (77%), GP appointments (59%), and blood tests (53%). Changes to clinical care were significantly associated with worse PGA (b = 8.95, p=0.01), pain (b = 7.13, p=0.05), fatigue (b = 17.01, p<0.00) and emotional distress (b = 12.78, p<0.01). Regarding self-management, 64% of patients reported changes to diet while 51% reduced physical activity. Change in diet was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes, whereas physical activity was associated with PGA (b=-2.42, p<0.01), pain (b=-2.43, p<0.01), fatigue (b=-2.5, p < 0.01), and emotional distress (b=-2.41, p<0.01). Conclusion Most patients (87%) had at least one area of clinical care affected by the lockdown. These changes in IA clinical care were associated with worse disease outcomes across all measures and greater emotional distress. In self-management, reduced physical activity was associated with worse outcomes in all physical and mental health measures. Disclosure M. Sweeney: None. L. Carpenter: None. S. de Souza: None. H.

This study compares the activity of our service before and after these changes. METHOD: Patients referred by the emergency department were prospectively identified over a four-week period beginning from the date of reconfiguration (COVID) and compared to patients retrospectively identified from the same period the previous year (Pre-COVID) and followed up for 30 days. Data was extracted from handover documents and electronic care records. RESULTS: There were 281 and 283 patients during the Pre-COVID and COVID periods, respectively. Rates of admission decreased (78.1% to 41.7%) whilst there were increased rates of ambulation (7.1% to 17.3%) and discharge (6% to 22.6%). Duration of admission decreased (6.9 to 4.8 days), and there were fewer operative and endoscopic interventions (78 to 40). There were increased ambulatory investigations (11 to 39), telephone reviews (0 to 39), and use of early CT to facilitate discharge (5% to 34.7%). There were no differences in 30-day readmission or mortality in any group.

There is a sparsity of existing studies examining COVID-19 related abdominal pain and the role of investigative imaging for the virus in these patients. Study aims were to determine COVID-19 incidence in those with acute abdominal pain in the absence of respiratory symptoms and to assess the performance of Computer Tomography (CT) thoracic imaging. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to our emergency general surgical unit between 1(st) March 2020 and 31(st) May 2020 was performed. All patients underwent nasal and oro-pharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR swabs as well as CT on admission. RESULTS: From 112 patients admitted with acute abdominal pain in the absence of respiratory symptoms, 16 (14.3%) tested positive for COVID-19 on RT-PCR swab testing. 50% (8/16) of these patients had no intra-abdominal pathology on CT. The sensitivity and specificity of CT thoracic imaging for COVID-19 was 43.8% and 91.7%. CONCLUSIONS: One in seven patients with abdominal pain without any respiratory symptoms tested positive. Half these patients represented COVID-19 manifesting primarily as acute abdominal pain. Combined swab testing and CT imaging should be performed in all abdominal pain presentations due to the varying diagnostic performance of thoracic CT in diagnosing COVID-19.","Zuberi, S; Mushtaq, Y; Patel, K; Vickramarajah, S; Askari, A; Rashid, F; Gurprashad, R",Br J Surg,602,24

METHOD: A database of pathology specimens coded with a diagnosis of IBD since 2012, was cross-referenced with trust-wide colorectal cancer database. NICE guidelines (2011) provided audit standard: Low risk require 5 yearly, moderate risk 3 yearly, and high-risk yearly colonoscopies. A randomised sample of IBD patients (n = 50) and all patients with both IBD and colorectal cancer (n = 4) were compared to this standard. RESULTS: Compliance to the audit standard within the population (n = 54) was only 50%, and only 25% within sub-group with both IBD and Colorectal cancer (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: Only 4 cases of colorectal cancer within our IBD population were on record since 2012, suggesting incomplete patient identification, perhaps due to unreliable coding. The importance of optimising cancer screening programmes has only increased following the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compliance within the audit population (n = 54) was only 50%, these findings promote a review of the screening process within the trust and advocate further complementary audits of additional NHS healthcare trusts.","Claxton, H; Johnson, C",Br J Surg,602,1

However, proning with concurrent use of sedation and muscle relaxants carries the hypothetical risk of brachial plexus injuries, thought to be due to stretch and compression of the abducted shoulder. CASE: We report the case of a long-stay critical care patient who required frequent proning due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and who presented with new right upper limb weakness. This case was referred to our local plastic surgery service and an injury to the upper trunk of the right brachial plexus was confirmed on nerve conduction studies. RECOMMENDATIONS: Following this case, we made adaptations to our local practice and modified our prone-specific SSKIN bundle (originally created to prevent pressure sores) to include a section on ‘Nerves’, with an accompanying diagram. We dubbed this the SSKINN bundle. This ensured safe prone positioning. We encourage other hospitals to put in place similar interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We present this as a pathology to consider in patients proned during the COVID-19 pandemic; and recommend checking for signs of focal neurological deficits of the upper limb upon removal of paralysis and sedation, with early referral of suspected cases.","Baldwin, A; Truelove, A; Ali, T",Br J Surg,602,20

The benefit of WALANT for foot and ankle surgeries is less clear, especially in patients with multiple comorbities. The primary aim of this study was to compare post-operative pain levels in patients undergoing ankle fracture fixation. Secondary objectives included comparison of intra-operative patient experiences, clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction 1-year post-procedure. METHOD: 129 patients presenting with ankle fractures were enrolled in a multicenter randomised control trial from February 2016 to January 2020. Patients with medial malleolar, lateral malleolar, bimalleolar or trimalleolar fractures received either WALANT (62 patients) or spinal anaesthesia (67 patients). A 5ml solution of 0.9% saline and 2% lidocaine with 1: 100,000 adrenaline was used for WALANT. RESULTS: Compared to patients who received spinal anaesthesia, those in the WALANT group experienced less post-operative discomfort and were more satisfied 1-year post-procedure (p-value = 0.003). Surgical outcomes were similar for both groups. Cost analysis revealed that WALANT is significantly more economical. CONCLUSIONS: WALANT is an effective and safe anaesthetic for foot and ankle procedures. Without use of a tourniquet, it reduces post-operative pain and so, eases patient recovery.","Borg, T M; Tahir, M; Heidari, N",Br J Surg,602,1

Can such crises create opportunities for migrant inclusion instead? As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, many refugee organizations have stepped up their outreach with stories of refugees helping out in the crisis. We have partnered with the country’s leading refugee advocate organizations to test whether solidarity narratives increase public engagement with refugee advocates. We employ a Facebook experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of refugee narratives. We test whether (1) migrant narratives framed in the context of COVID-19, (2) COVID-19 migrant narratives targeted to more or less local communities, and (3) COVID-19 migrant narratives labeled as refugee vs. immigrant efforts enhance public engagement with refugee organizations. Our results indicate that migrant narratives framed in the context of COVID-19 do not motivate greater engagement than those that make no mention of the pandemic. Our results provide suggestive evidence that locally targeted efforts motivate greater engagement. Finally, we find no difference between the “refugee” and “immigrant” label, but we show that both labels can motivate greater engagement than ads that include neither. Importantly, this is true even in the context of COVID-19, an uncertain environment where worries of backlash might be warranted. These results suggest promising strategies for migrant policy organizations to promote engagement during and possibly after the pandemic.","Adida, Claire L.; Lo, Adeline; Prather, Lauren; Williamson, Scott",,602,17

Taking insights from an informed review of multi-grounded theories, we propose an extended framework of socio-ecological predictors concerning parental internet mediation. This contribution offers an innovative methodological and analytical perspective to consider both psychological and behavioral predictors for promoting resilience. This review acknowledged resilience as a strength-based measure to ensure online safety among young individuals.

Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we report a comprehensive post-translational modification (PTM) analysis of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NCP), the most abundant structural component of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. In addition to phosphoryl groups, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 NCP is decorated with a variety of PTMs, including N-glycans and ubiquitin. Based on newly identified PTMs, refined protein structural models of SARS-CoV-2 NCP were proposed and potential immune recognition epitopes of NCP were aligned with PTMs. These data can facilitate the design of novel vaccines or therapeutics targeting NCP, as valuable alternatives to the current vaccination and treatment paradigm that is under threat of the ever-mutating SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.","Sun, Zeyu; Zheng, Xiaoqin; Ji, Feiyang; Zhou, Menghao; Su, Xiaoling; Ren, Keyi; Li, Lanjuan",,602,29

The systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) is a novel systemic inflammatory marker based on peripheral neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of admission SIRI in patients with spontaneous ICH and compare its predictive ability with that of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This retrospective study was conducted based on a prospectively collected database of patients with ICH between June 2016 and January 2019. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to adjust for potential imbalances in the clinical parameters. A total of 403 patients were included in the original cohort. The optimal SIRI cut-off value was 2.76. After 1:1 PSM based on potential confounding variables, a new cohort containing 262 patients was established for further analysis. In the original cohort, SIRI served as an independent predictor of 3-month functional outcome [odds ratio (OR), 1.302; 95% CI, 1.120–1.512; p = 0.001] and 1-month mortality (OR, 1.072; 95% CI, 1.020–1.126; p = 0.006), while NLR was independently associated with only 3-month functional outcomes (OR, 1.051; 95% CI, 1.004–1.100; p = 0.031) and not 1-month mortality. The same applied to the PSM cohort. Receiver operating characteristic analyses and predictive models indicated that in most instances, SIRI was superior to NLR and their components in predicting the outcomes of patients with ICH. Our study found that SIRI is determined to be an independent predictive indicator for ICH patients in 3-month functional outcomes and 1-month mortality. The prognostic predictive ability of SIRI was stronger than that of NLR.","Li, Junhong; Yuan, Yunbo; Liao, Xiang; Yu, Zhiyuan; Li, Hao; Zheng, Jun",Front Neurol,602,21

The tools of science education, however, uniquely enable students to explore social inequities as well as the natural world. Thus, a role of education can be to embed social justice in science curricula. Presented here are three case studies that investigate pedagogical methods used by experienced teachers to integrate social justice into upper level high-school biology curricula. Two separate semi-constructed interviews were conducted with participants, along with an analysis of their pedagogical materials. Two main themes are identified and explored: (1) delivery methods (pedagogy) and (2) biological science content. Storytelling and culturally responsive pedagogy were reported to be highly effective in engaging students; using these vehicles for delivery, social justice content can be seamlessly introduced alongside organic evolution. This embedded exploratory multiple-case study serves as an example of how science education can become a tool for student empowerment.

The findings revealed that PwPMI calls did not increase immediately after the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. Instead, a sustained increase in PwPMI calls was identified in August 2020 that later became statistically significant in October 2020. Ultimately, the analysis revealed a 22% increase in PwPMI calls during the COVID-19 pandemic than would have been expected had the pandemic not taken place. The delayed effect of the pandemic on such calls points to a need for policymakers to prioritize widely accessible mental health care that can be deployed early during public health emergencies thus potentially mitigating or eliminating the need for increased police intervention, as was the case here.

The risk of a central venous stenosis or occlusion is greatly increased with a central venous catheter and cardiological or oncological interventions. The implantation of the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO®) graft (Merit Medical Systems Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) is meanwhile an established combined interventional/surgical procedure for restoration of the stenosed or occluded venous outflow. In this way the vascular access in the upper extremity can be preserved and the important vascular resource of the lower extremity can be spared. In our center a total of 73 successful implantations have been carried out since 2013. The demand is increasing. With growing clinical experience, the surgical intervention has become an established low risk procedure. According to our clinical experiences, after an implantation a reintervention for acute thrombosis is necessary 2–3 times per year. With appropriate experience revision interventions are usually technically easy to carry out. In cases of complete occlusion of the central venous circulation in the region of the superior vena cava, which cannot be passed by the HeRO® graft, a combined intervention with the Surfacer® System (inside-out procedure) is possible and meaningful. When necessary, the HeRO® graft can also be used with an early cannulation graft in order to avoid a temporary dialysis catheter. Despite the increasing numbers of HeRO® graft implantations, this option remains a reserve procedure in our center. The interventional procedures without implantation of foreign material should first be attempted and established vascular surgical alternatives, such as an internal jugular vein graft should be given priority.","Harter, Nomita; Mündlein, Eckehard",Gefasschirurgie,602,26

METHODS The literature was systematically reviewed to assess the global burden of relevant comorbid entities, to determine the number of patients who potentially utilize AEDs and antiretroviral agents (ARVs), and to address AED-ARV interactions. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AED-ARV administration may be indicated in up to 55% of people taking ARVs. Patients receiving phenytoin may require a lopinavir/ritonavir dosage increase of ~50% to maintain unchanged serum concentrations (Level C). Patients receiving valproic acid may require a zidovudine dosage reduction to maintain unchanged serum zidovudine concentrations (Level C). Coadministration of valproic acid and efavirenz may not require efavirenz dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients receiving ritonavir/atazanavir may require a lamotrigine dosage increase of ∼50% to maintain unchanged lamotrigine serum concentrations (Level C). Coadministration of raltegravir/atazanavir and lamotrigine may not require lamotrigine dosage adjustment (Level C). Coadministration of raltegravir and midazolam may not require midazolam dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients may be counseled that it is unclear whether dosage adjustment is necessary when other AEDs and ARVs are combined (Level U). It may be important to avoid enzyme-inducing AEDs in people on ARV regimens that include protease inhibitors or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as pharmacokinetic interactions may result in virologic failure, which has clinical implications for disease progression and development of ARV resistance. If such regimens are required for seizure control, patients may be monitored through pharmacokinetic assessments to ensure efficacy of the ARV regimen (Level C).","Birbeck, G L; French, J A; Perucca, E; Simpson, D M; Fraimow, H; George, J M; Okulicz, J F; Clifford, D B; Hachad, H; Levy, R H",Neurology,602,1

In the U.S. there are two BoHV1 subtypes, BoHV-1.1 and BoHV-1.2b. Control programs in North America incorporate modified live (MLV) or killed (KV) viral vaccines. However, BoHV-1 strains continue to be isolated from diseased animals or fetuses after vaccination. It is possible to differentiate BoHV-1 wild-type from MLV vaccine strains by determining their single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns through either whole-genome sequencing or PCR sequencing of genomic regions containing vaccine-defining SNPs. To determine the BoHV-1 subtype in clinical isolates and their relationship to MLV strains, 8 isolates from varied clinical disease at three different laboratories in the U.S. were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Five samples were isolated within the past 5 years from New York and 3 were archived samples recovered 35 years prior from Oklahoma and Louisiana. Based on phylogenetic analysis, four of the cases appeared to be due to an MLV vaccine: 3 cases of aborted fetuses and one neonate with systemic BoHV-1 disease. One aborted fetus was from a herd with no reported history of MLV vaccination in two years. The remaining four isolates did not group with any MLV vaccines: two were associated with bovine respiratory disease, one with vulvovaginitis, and a fourth was determined to be a BoHV-1.2b respiratory isolate. Recovery of BoHV-1.1 that is very closely related to an MLV vaccine virus from a herd not receiving vaccines in an extended period prior to its isolation suggests that MLV viruses may remain latent or circulate within herds for long periods.","Fulton, R W; d'Offay, J M; Dubovi, E J; Eberle, R",Virus research,602,1

This study investigated the regional three-dimensional (3D) deformation of the AT during conditioning. Eighteen ATs were scanned using 3D freehand ultrasound during 10 successive 25 s submaximal (50%) voluntary isometric plantarflexion contractions. Longitudinal strain was assessed for the whole AT, aponeurosis, and free AT and transverse strain was assessed for the proximal-, mid-, and distal-portions of the free AT. Longitudinal conditioning of the whole AT was primarily driven by creep response of the free AT and transverse conditioning was greatest for the mid-portion of the free AT. Whole and free AT longitudinal strain increased up to the third contraction and were accompanied by a corresponding reduction in free AT cross-sectional area (CSA) strain in proximal-, mid-, and distal-portions. No significant changes in aponeurosis strain or tendon volume were detected between contractions. These findings suggest that conditioning alters free AT shape, with increased tendon length attained at the expense of reduction in free AT CSA. Although AT experiences different amounts of strain in different regions, the number of contractions required to reach steady-state strain during conditioning is uniform throughout the tendon.","Nuri, L; Obst, S J; Newsham-West, R; Barrett, R S",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,602,26

We aimed to determine clinical outcomes for patients with established ORN managed solely via PENTO or PENTOCLO. METHODS The study retrospectively reviewed and collected data from the medical records of 169 patients diagnosed with ORN and treated via medical management. Patients that received any additional interventions such as surgery or hyperbaric oxygen were not included. RESULTS Medical management led to healed ORN in 54.4% (n=92/169) of patients after an average of 12.9 months. Outcome comparison between PENTO and PENTOCLO identified the former regime to be significantly superior (p=0.0001). There is an inverse relationship with increasing ORN severity and healing with medical management (p<0.0001) with oropharyngeal cancer (p=0.0347) patients responding favourably via this approach. Infection had a critical role in the final outcome with those healing requiring 1.3 antibiotic prescriptions, while those that had disease progression requiring 4.3 prescriptions.

The first 52 consecutive patients who underwent SITE at our institution were compared with the preceding 52 MLH repairs. RESULTS Of the first 52 patients undergoing SITE, there were no conversions to either open or multiport surgery. The mean operative time for the SITE cases did not differ significantly from that of MLH. Complications were equivalent between the 2 groups and included postoperative seroma and urinary retention.

The potential benefits afforded by a single incision laparoscopic (SILS) approach make it appropriate to consider. METHODS Electronic data were prospectively collected from all patients who underwent SILS restorative proctocolectomy (SILS-RPC) between June 2009 and June 2010. RESULTS Ten consecutive patients (4 male), with median BMI = 22 (range = 20-28 kg/m(2)) underwent SILS-LRPC over a 1-year period. Three had undergone a previous emergency laparoscopic colectomy. A single-port device (Covidien SILS™ or Olympus TriPort™) was positioned at the site of the existing or proposed temporary ileostomy (2.5-cm incision). The colon and rectum were extracted through the SILS site (n = 8) or transanally following a mucosectomy (n = 2). A 20-cm J pouch was constructed extracorporeally and returned via the ileostomy site. Pouch-anal anastomosis was performed intracorporeally (n = 8) or hand-sutured (n = 2) and a diverting loop ileostomy was created at the SILS port site. The median operation time was 185 min (range = 100-381). There were no conversions or additional ports required. Median time to full diet was 36 h (range = 4-48 h) with a median hospital stay of 3 days (range = 2-8 days). There were no 30-day readmissions. Complications included surgical emphysema with temperature and a panic attack. Nine stomas have been closed. All patients have spontaneity of defecation, with a median pouch frequency of four per day, including once at night. All are fully continent and able to defer during the day. One reported a dry ejaculate for 10 weeks. CONCLUSION SILS restorative proctocolectomy is safe with good early functional outcomes when performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon.","Gash, K J; Goede, A C; Kaldowski, B; Vestweber, B; Dixon, A R",Surgical endoscopy,602,19

However, the influence of hemodynamic factors on clinical outcome is still unclear after EVT. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is an important brain reserve mechanism and is impaired after AIS. This study aimed to explore the role of dCA in predicting the outcome of AIS patients after EVT. METHODS AIS patients with severe stenosis/occlusion of unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid and treatment with EVT were enrolled to receive dCA examinations at the 24 h, 72 h and 7th day after stroke onset. Healthy volunteers were also recruited as controls. DCA was recorded from spontaneous fluctuations of blood pressure and MCA flow velocity. Transfer function analysis was used to derive dCA parameters, including phase difference (PD) and coherence in the low-frequency range (0.06-0.12 Hz). The clinical outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days after onset. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to reveal the correlation between dCA and clinical outcomes. The receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve was performed to determine the cut-off point of PD. RESULTS A total of 62 AIS patients and 77 healthy controls were included. Compared with controls, dCA were impaired bilaterally till to 7th day after onset in patients, presenting as much lower PD value on the ipsilateral side. During follow-up, we found that PD on the ipsilateral side at 24 h after onset was significantly lower in patients with unfavourable outcome (n = 41) than those with favourable outcome (n = 21), even after adjustment of confounding factors (p = 0.009). ROC curve analysis revealed that PD < 26.93° was an independent predictor of unfavourable-outcome. CONCLUSION In AIS patients after EVT, dCA was impaired on both sides over the first 7 days. PD on the ipsilateral side at 24 h after onset is an independent unfavourable-outcome predictor for AIS after EVT.","Tian, Ge; Ji, Zhong; Huang, Kaibin; Lin, Zhenzhou; Pan, Suyue; Wu, Yongming",BMC neurology,602,1

While involved mechanisms were previously evidenced at the spinal level, changes at the cortical level were also hypothesized. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of 30 min of 100-Hz tibialis anterior muscle vibration on force production capacities and to further identify the respective changes in spinal loop properties, descending voluntary drive and corticospinal properties. METHODS Thirteen subjects were tested before and after a vibration condition, and before and after a resting control condition. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in dorsiflexion was measured. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was superimposed during MVCs to assess cortical voluntary activation (VATMS), motor-evoked potential amplitude (MEP) and cortical silent period length (CSP). MEP and CSP were also measured during 50 and 75 % MVC contractions. Spinal excitability was investigated by mean of H-reflex. RESULTS There were no vibration effects on MVC (p = 0.805), maximal EMG activity (p = 0.653), VATMS (p = 1), and CSP (p = 0.877). Vibration tended to decrease MEP amplitude (p = 0.117). H-reflex amplitude was depressed following vibration (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Dorsiflexion maximal force production capacities were unaffected by 30 min of tibialis anterior muscle vibration, despite spinal loop and corticospinal excitabilities being reduced. These findings suggest that acute prolonged vibration has the potential to modulate corticospinal excitability of lower limb muscles without a concomitant functional consequence.","Farabet, Adrien; Souron, Robin; Millet, Guillaume Y; Lapole, Thomas",European journal of applied physiology,602,10

An important component in the surgical management of GERD is either laparoscopic or endoscopic restoration of the native gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV). Recently, a procedure combining laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair with transoral incisionless fundoplication (cTIF) was introduced. This relatively new operation is performed in collaboration between the gastrointestinal (GI) surgeon and the gastroenterologist. METHODS By working together, both interventionalists gain new insight into the ideal GEFV by observing the same operation being performed from different perspectives. In the cTIF, the gastroenterologist learns from an external perspective, through the laparoscopic view, the importance of the crura in contributing to the antireflux barrier. Similarly, the GI surgeon gains understanding of the elements that define an effective and desirable GEFV through an endoscopic perspective. RESULTS This collaboration with cTIF and seeing the procedure from different perspectives have led to our improved understanding of 1) factors contributing to an optimal surgically constructed GEFV and 2) the limitations of the GEFV constructed by the conventional laparoscopic total and partial fundoplications. CONCLUSION The collaboration between GI surgery and gastroenterology with cTIF has led to an improved understanding in characteristics of an optimal antireflux barrier and allowed for a proposed technical modification of the current fundoplication technique to optimize the construct of the surgical GEFV.","Nguyen, Ninh T; Chinn, Justine; Chang, Kenneth",Surgical endoscopy,602,16

In 2016 we developed a solid media transport card; for that pilot study to control the self-collection we used a pseudo-self-collection technique. The current study expands this prior work using true self-collections and only the POI card, and aims to evaluate the solid media transport card to detect HR-HPV in self-samples compared to liquid transport media. METHODS Ten thousand eight hundred eighty-five women between the ages of 30-59 with no screening for 3 years were enrolled. The self-collected sample was first applied to a new solid media transport card (Labeled as SC) then the brush placed in 6 ml ThinPrep liquid (Labeled as SL). Then a physician collected a direct endocervical specimen into ThinPrep liquid (Labeled as DL). Samples were tested with Cobas 4800 and the SeqHPV NGS assay for HR-HPV. Patients positive on any test were recalled for colposcopy and biopsy. RESULTS Ten thousand three hundred thirty-nine participants had complete data. The mean age was 43.9 years. CIN 2+ rates were 1.4% (142/10339). The agreement in HPV detection between the two different self-sample collection media was also good (Cobas HPV kappa = 0.86; SeqHPV kappa = 0.98). Tested with Cobas, the sensitivity of Cobas-SL and Cobas-SC for CIN 2+ was95.07 and 94.37%; and for CIN3+ was 96.30, 96.30% respectively. The specificity of Cobas-SC, and Cobas-SL for CIN2+ was 88.74 and 87.35%; for CIN3 was 88.04and 86.65% respectively. Tested with SeqHPV, the sensitivity for CIN2+ of Seq-SC and Seq-SL was 95.77 and 96.48%; for CIN3+, both the SC and SL specimens had a sensitivity of 100%. The specificity for CIN2+ of Seq-SC and Seq-SL was 89.54 and 89.53%; for CIN3+ was 88.84,88.82% respectively. For both HR-HPV assays, the sensitivities were similar for the two self-sample media (SC vs SL, p = 1.00).

Reovirus binds to cell surface glycans, junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A), and the Nogo-1 receptor (depending on the cell type) and enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Within the endocytic compartment, reovirus undergoes stepwise disassembly, which is followed by release of the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm. In a small-molecule screen to identify host mediators of reovirus infection, we found that treatment of cells with 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT), a prototype serotonin receptor agonist, diminished reovirus cytotoxicity. 5-NT also blocked reovirus infection. In contrast, treatment of cells with methiothepin mesylate, a serotonin antagonist, enhanced infection by reovirus. 5-NT did not alter cell surface expression of JAM-A or attachment of reovirus to cells. However, 5-NT altered the distribution of early endosomes with a concomitant impairment of reovirus transit to late endosomes and a delay in reovirus disassembly. Consistent with an inhibition of viral disassembly, 5-NT treatment did not alter infection by in vitro-generated infectious subvirion particles, which bind to JAM-A but bypass a requirement for proteolytic uncoating in endosomes to infect cells. We also found that treatment of cells with 5-NT decreased the infectivity of alphavirus chikungunya virus and coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. These data suggest that serotonin receptor signaling influences cellular activities that regulate entry of diverse virus families and provides a new, potentially broad-spectrum target for antiviral drug development. IMPORTANCE Identification of well-characterized small molecules that modulate viral infection can accelerate development of antiviral therapeutics while also providing new tools to increase our understanding of the cellular processes that underlie virus-mediated cell injury. We conducted a small-molecule screen to identify compounds capable of inhibiting cytotoxicity caused by reovirus, a prototype double-stranded RNA virus. We found that 5-nonyloxytryptamine (5-NT) impairs reovirus infection by altering viral transport during cell entry. Remarkably, 5-NT also inhibits infection by an alphavirus and a coronavirus. The antiviral properties of 5-NT suggest that serotonin receptor signaling is an important regulator of infection by diverse virus families and illuminate a potential new drug target.","Mainou, Bernardo A; Ashbrook, Alison W; Smith, Everett Clinton; Dorset, Daniel C; Denison, Mark R; Dermody, Terence S",Journal of virology,602,1

Therefore, wearing eyeglasses more than 8 hours per day may be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly because eyeglasses are a barrier that reduces the frequency with which people touch their eyes. The aim of the study was to determine if eyeglasses protect from COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used UK Biobank (UKB) data to corroborate findings of the Hubei study in the UK population. RESULTS Eyewear was associated with a reduced risk of infection, odds ratio (OR)=0.77. The effects of sex, age, and eyewear were independent and significant at the 95% level.

The Src family of kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that regulate inflammation, cell proliferation, motility, and adhesion. To investigate potential histologic lesions associated with systemic loss of Csk gene activity in adult mice, conditional Csk-knockout mice were examined. Cre-mediated systemic excision of Csk induced by tamoxifen treatment resulted in multiorgan inflammation. Specifically, induction of Csk gene excision with three days of tamoxifen treatment resulted in greater than 90% gene excision. Strikingly, these mice developed enteritis that ranged from minimal and suppurative to severe, fibrinonecrosuppurative and hemorrhagic. Other inflammatory lesions included suppurative pneumonia, gastritis, and myocarditis, and increased numbers of inflammatory cells within the hepatic parenchyma. When tamoxifen treatment was reduced from three days to one day in an effort to lower the level of Csk gene excision and limit lesion development, the mice developed severe suppurative to pyogranulomatous pneumonia and minimal to mild suppurative enteritis. Lesions observed secondary to Csk gene excision suggest important roles for Csk in downregulating the proinflammatory activity of the Src family of kinases and limiting neutrophil-mediated inflammation.","Berman-Booty, Lisa D; Eraslan, Rukiye; Hanumegowda, Umesh; Cantor, Glenn H; Bounous, Denise I; Janovitz, Evan B; Jones, Beverly K; Buiakova, Olesia; Hayward, Michael; Wee, Susan",Veterinary pathology,602,16

Conventional confirmatory testing include skin tests and, for a few drugs, quantification of drug-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. However, none of these tests are absolutely predictive for the clinical outcome, and can yield false-negative and false-positive results. We performed a proof-of-concept study to assess whether a mast cell activation test could improve diagnosis of IgE-mediated chlorhexidine hypersensitivity, a common cause of perioperative anaphylaxis. METHODS Human mast cells were generated from CD34+ progenitor cells and sensitised with patients' sera to become IgE+ human mast cells (dMCIgE+), and then incubated with chlorhexidine to assess degranulation. We compared the diagnostic performance of this mast cell activation test with serum from patients with and without positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine. RESULTS In dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a positive skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine showed drug-specific and concentration-dependent degranulation upon stimulation with chlorhexidine, determined by surface upregulation of the degranulation marker CD63. In contrast, dMC sensitised with sera from patients with a negative skin test and basophil activation test to chlorhexidine were unresponsive in the mast cell activation test. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the mast cell activation test can be used to diagnose IgE/FcεRI-dependent immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions. It also shows potential to assess the clinical relevance of drug-specific IgE antibodies in their ability to elicit mast cell degranulation, and therefore discriminate between allergy and sensitisation. Extended studies are required to verify whether this technique can be used in other causes of perioperative anaphylaxis.","Elst, Jessy; van der Poorten, Marie-Line M; Faber, Margaretha A; Van Gasse, Athina L; Garvey, Lene H; Bridts, Chris H; De Puysseleyr, Leander P; Mertens, Christel; Hagendorens, Margo M; Sabato, Vito; Ebo, Didier G",British journal of anaesthesia,602,1

METHODS Microparticles were prepared from oxidised starch coupled to natural polyamine for Tc-99m complexation. Suspensions were formulated as ready-to-use kits for easy one-step labelling procedures. RESULTS Particle-size analysis, electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy were performed for microparticle characterisation, and gave a typical size distribution ranging from 7 to 63 microm, with a homogenous population of spherical or oval-shaped microparticles. Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and was stable for at least 8 h. When challenged with histidine and human plasma, labelling was also stable. Dynamic scintigraphic acquisitions and biodistribution studies conducted on healthy Wistar rats showed a tracer accumulation with more than 80% of the ID in the lungs after 15 min. CONCLUSIONS With clinically significant characteristics such as a lung half-life of 3 h, a lung-to-vascular ratio of 900, and a lung-to-liver ratio of 90, starch-based microparticles exhibit all the qualities for an effective new lung perfusion agent.","Lacoeuille, Franck; Hindré, François; Denizot, Benoit; Bouchet, Francis; Legras, Pierre; Couturier, Olivier; Askiénazy, Serge; Benoit, Jean Pierre; Le Jeune, Jean Jacques",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,602,29

These agents aggregate and expand exponentially at the tumor site, resulting in potent immune activation and tumor clearance. Moreover, the ability to elaborate these cells with therapeutic agents, such as antibodies, enzymes, and immunostimulatory molecules, presents an unprecedented opportunity to specifically modulate the tumor microenvironment through cell-mediated drug delivery. This unique pharmacology, combined with significant advances in synthetic biology and cell engineering, has established a new paradigm for cells as vectors for drug delivery. Targeted cellular micropharmacies (TCMs) are a revolutionary new class of living drugs, which we envision will play an important role in cancer medicine and beyond.

Here, we first report on the safety and effectiveness of inserting the jejunal tubes under the dual guidance (DG) of video-laryngoscopy and ultrasound in patients in whom jejunal tube placement during invasive mechanical ventilation is difficult. METHODS Twenty patients in the emergency department-based intensive care unit (ICU) who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and had difficulty in jejunal tube placement were selected for video-laryngoscopy and ultrasound-guided jejunal tube placement (the DG group), and the outcomes were compared with patients experiencing difficult intubation before the introduction of the DG technique (the control group) in terms of the incidence of postintubation complications and the effectiveness and efficiency of nutritional support. RESULTS The DG group had a significantly higher success rate of intubation and better nutritional status than the control group. The incidences of nasopharyngeal bleeding, dental and gingival injuries, and tracheostomy tube dislodgement were not significantly increased in the DG group, and the blood pressure and heart rate also showed no significant fluctuations.

We sought to identify whether the association between recanalization after intra-arterial acute stroke therapy and favorable clinical response is modified by the presence of good collateral flow assessed on baseline CTA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data are from the Keimyung Stroke Registry, a prospective cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke from Daegu, South Korea. Patients with M1 segment MCA with or without intracranial ICA occlusions on baseline CTA from May 2004 to July 2009 who also had baseline MR imaging were included. Two readers blinded to all clinical information assessed baseline and follow-up imaging. Leptomeningeal collaterals on baseline CTA were assessed by consensus by use of the regional leptomeningeal score. RESULTS Among 84 patients (mean age, 65.2 ± 13.2 years; median NIHSS score, 14; interquartile range, 8.5), median time from stroke onset to initial MR imaging was 164 minutes. TICI 2b-3 recanalization was achieved in 38.1% of patients and mRS 0-2 at 90 days in 35.8% of patients. In a multivariable model, the interaction between collateral status and recanalization was significant. Only patients with intermediate or good collaterals who recanalized showed a statistically significant association with good clinical outcome (rate ratio = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.1). Patients with good and intermediate collaterals who did not achieve recanalization and patients with poor collaterals, even if they achieved recanalization, did not do well. CONCLUSIONS Patients with good or intermediate collaterals on CTA benefit from intra-arterial therapy, whereas patients with poor collaterals do not benefit from treatment.","Nambiar, V; Sohn, S I; Almekhlafi, M A; Chang, H W; Mishra, S; Qazi, E; Eesa, M; Demchuk, A M; Goyal, M; Hill, M D; Menon, B K",AJNR.

Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of the overlap method for esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy after LTG or laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG), respectively. METHODS Twenty-five patients underwent anastomosis using a linear stapler during esophagojejunostomy and esophagogastrostomy after LTG and LPG, respectively. Clinicopathological data and surgical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS The average surgical duration for LTG was 236.8 min compared with 224.1 min for LPG. Postoperative complications were observed in four patients (16.0%); these included a wound infection, an intestinal obstruction, an afferent loop syndrome, and a reflux symptom. The average postoperative hospital stay of the patients was 12.5 days. There was no case of conversion to open surgery, anastomotic leakage or stenosis, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The overlap method for esophagojejunostomy or esophagogastrostomy after LTG or LPG is safe and feasible and does not require an additional minilaparotomy, which may result in less pain and favorable cosmetic outcomes.","Tsujimoto, Hironori; Uyama, Ichiro; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Kumano, Isao; Takahata, Risa; Matsumoto, Yusuke; Yoshida, Kazumichi; Horiguchi, Hiroyuki; Aosasa, Suefumi; Ono, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Junji; Hase, Kazuo",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,602,1

This study evaluated the socio-demographic characteristics, as well as residual spatial correlation in pregnancy termination among Bangladeshi women. METHODS Secondary data was obtained from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey for the survey year 2014. Data included 17,863 samples of ever-married women between the ages of 15-49 years, which is a national representative sample in Bangladesh. Bayesian spatial logistic regression was used to assess the associations between socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy termination. We flexibly modeled the non-linear effects of the continuous covariates while accounting for residual spatial correlation at the district level. RESULTS Our findings revealed that about 19% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported ever had a pregnancy terminated. The risk of pregnancy termination was higher among women who had been working, had a higher wealth index, were in a conjugal relationship, had no children, were older and started their cohabitation earlier. Residual spatial patterns revealed the areas at a higher risk of pregnancy termination, including Panchagarh, Habiganj, and Sylhet after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of pregnancy termination remains considerably high in Bangladesh. The study revealed significant associations of women's age at survey time, age at first cohabitation, occupational status, socio-economic status, marital status and the total number of children ever born with reporting having a history of terminated pregnancy among Bangladeshi ever-married women. The identified socio-demographic characteristics and districts at an increased likelihood of pregnancy termination can inform localized intervention and prevention strategies to improve the reproductive healthcare of women in Bangladesh.","Zahan, Rifat; Feng, Cindy Xin",BMC public health,602,16

A three-stage approach is preferred in particularly debilitated patients. In this setting, laparoscopic surgery has shown to be safe, offering several advantages over the open approach. Single incision laparoscopic surgery is a new minimally invasive approach which represents a true scarless procedure for the first step of the restorative proctocolectomy. In this article, we describe our technique in performing the single-incision total abdominal colectomy. METHODS The single-access device is inserted through a circular incision made at the ileostomy site, which was marked preoperatively. The procedure is performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments through one 12-mm and three 5-mm trocars introduced in the single-access device gel platform. Good exposure of the operating field is obtained by changing the Trendelenburg position and the lateral tilting of the table. We start the operation by mobilizing the right colon, then proceeding clockwise to the rectosigmoid junction. The ileocolic pedicle is divided after the visualization of the right ureter and duodenum. The right colon is mobilized in the medial-to-lateral fashion. The hepatocolic ligament is taken down, and the transverse mesocolon and the greater omentum are divided to mobilize the transverse colon. Subsequently, the lateral attachments of descending colon are taken sharply, and the avascular line of Toldt is bluntly dissected. Under direct visualization of the left ureter, the inferior mesenteric vein and the branches of the sigmoid arteries are identified, dissected, and divided. After switching to a 5-mm laparoscope, the rectosigmoid junction is divided with an endoscopic stapler. The specimen is exteriorized, and the terminal ileum is divided extracorporeally. Finally, the ileostomy is matured in the standard Brooke fashion. CONCLUSION Between May and November 2010, we performed ten single-incision total abdominal colectomies, all completed successfully without complications or need of conversion, with a mean operative time of 139±24 min and an estimated blood loss of 100±120 ml. The postoperative course was unremarkable in all cases, with prompt return of bowel activity and short postoperative stay. In our experience, single-incision total abdominal colectomy has shown to be a safe alternative to standard laparoscopy in selected patients and appears to be a promising technique with the potential to improve short-term outcomes.","Fichera, Alessandro; Zoccali, Marco; Gullo, Roberto",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,602,1

As a heavily visual discipline, pathology has been able to leverage social media platforms for trainee education, curbside and official consultations, interdisciplinary communication, and interactions among medical professionals and patient education. The pathology community has been at the forefront of using social media as an educational forum, and the hematopathology community has emerged as one of the strongest and most influential presences on these online platforms. In this review, we perform an in-depth analysis of various Twitter metrics to demonstrate key trends in the usage of social media as it pertains to hematopathology using the hashtag #Hemepath and we describe specific details on how hematopathologists have managed to take advantage of Twitter in furthering our mission of advancing medical education and disseminating knowledge using these innovative virtual educational experiences. RECENT FINDINGS The hematopathology community has a great degree of enthusiasm among residents, fellows, and faculty in sharing educational material using case-based examples, participating in group-based online activities, introducing new publications by article authors or readership, and disseminating educational ""pearls"" from medical conferences, using hashtags and digital images that otherwise would not be readily available to many around the globe. This practice is helping reshape the structure of our field and is providing opportunities to optimize the educational experience by enhancing the instant exposure to cutting-edge information and expert opinions, among other valuable features. The hematopathology community has leveraged social media platforms for disseminating educational material and strengthening interdisciplinary interactions and is a ""poster child"" for a medical subspecialty that has thrived and flourished by more broadly adopting virtual educational platforms. We hope that this review will provide details on how social media platforms can be used by others in the medical field to achieve similar goals.","El Hussein, S; Lyapichev, Kirill A; Crane, Genevieve M; Mirza, Kamran M; Pemmaraju, Naveen; Medeiros, L Jeffrey; Khoury, Joseph D; Loghavi, Sanam",Current hematologic malignancy reports,602,16

This may relate to the confinement of PEDV natural infection to the protease-rich small intestine of pigs. Our study focused on the role of protease activity on infection by investigating the spike protein of a PEDV isolate (wtPEDV) using a reverse genetics system based on the trypsin-independent cell culture-adapted strain DR13 (caPEDV). We demonstrate that trypsin acts on the wtPEDV spike protein after receptor binding. We mapped the genetic determinant for trypsin-dependent cell entry to the N-terminal region of the fusion subunit of this class I fusion protein, revealing a conserved arginine just upstream of the putative fusion peptide as the potential cleavage site. Whereas coronaviruses are typically processed by endogenous proteases of the producer or target cell, PEDV S protein activation strictly required supplementation of a protease, enabling us to study mechanistic details of proteolytic processing. Importance: Recurring PEDV epidemics constitute a serious animal health threat and an economic burden, particularly in Asia but, as of recently, also on the North-American subcontinent. Understanding the biology of PEDV is critical for combatting the infection.

Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to implement effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described for the country. Within this local transmission cluster, we also identified the H49Y amino acid change in the Spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country.

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 43 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Records for dogs with suspected migrating intrathoracic grass awns examined between 2010 and 2013 were reviewed. Ultrasonographic images and additional information such as signalment and pleural fluid analysis, radiographic, bronchoscopic, and CT findings were collected. Surgical treatments and outcomes were also reviewed. RESULTS Transthoracic or transesophageal ultrasonography revealed grass awns in the pleural space (n = 13) or pulmonary parenchyma (10) of 23 dogs. Surgical removal of grass awns was successful on the first attempt in 21 of these 23 dogs (including 11/23 that had intraoperative ultrasonography performed to aid localization and removal of the awn). In the remaining 2 dogs, a second surgery was required. Twenty dogs with evidence of migrating intrathoracic grass awns had no foreign body identified on initial ultrasonographic evaluation and were treated medically; 16 developed draining fistulas, and awns identified ultrasonographically at follow-up visits were subsequently removed from the sublumbar region (n = 10) or thoracic wall (6). The remaining 4 dogs had no grass awn visualized. Clinical signs resolved in all dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Transthoracic, transesophageal, and intraoperative ultrasonography were useful for localization and removal of migrating intrathoracic grass awns. Ultrasonography may be considered a valuable and readily available diagnostic tool for monitoring dogs with suspected migrating intrathoracic grass awns.","Caivano, Domenico; Birettoni, Francesco; Rishniw, Mark; Bufalari, Antonello; De Monte, Valentina; Proni, Alessia; Giorgi, Maria Elena; Porciello, Francesco",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,602,1

OBJECTIVE We offer a comprehensive review of the temporoparietal fascia flap (TPFF) and provide a step-by-step illustration of its application performed under local anesthesia for a challenging reconstructive scenario. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 66-year-old male initially underwent Mohs micrographic surgery resulting in a large full-thickness defect at the postauricular scalp contiguous with a through-and-through defect of the upper right ear. A TPFF was performed under local anesthesia to reconstruct the surgical defect. RESULTS Complete healing in our patient was noted at 10 weeks after completion of the TPFF. However, granulation caused adherence of the ear to the postauricular scalp, which was corrected by a dividing incision to release the ear. At 4 weeks after the division, lateral projection of the ears was symmetric and readherence of the ear did not recur. CONCLUSION The TPFF is a highly versatile pedicled flap that can be performed under local anesthesia to reconstruct a variety of complex defects on the head and neck. This case reveals that the TPFF adds a powerful tool to the armamentarium of dermatologic surgeons.","Mavropoulos, John C; Bordeaux, Jeremy S",Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],602,1

One should recognize the multitude of surfactants that are used in today's products to identify any potential allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) or irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). Given their abundance in everyday products, it is understandable that many cases of occupational contact dermatitis that arise can be attributed to surfactants. The products most connected with ACD are cocamidopropyl betaine, oleamidopropyl dimethylamine, decyl glucoside, 3-dimethylaminopropylamine, amidoamine, and cocamide diethanolamine. Similarly, the most common surfactant-related causes of ICD are sodium lauryl sulfate and benzalkonium chloride. It is important for dermatologists to identify the causes and differentiate between the two, to adjust treatments and products accordingly. Here, the most frequently used surfactants, as well as their correlation between ACD and ICD, will be reviewed.","Presley, Colby L; Militello, Michelle; Barber, Cara; Ladd, Ryan; Laughter, Melissa; Ferguson, Heather; Dewey, Jesse; Pulsipher, Kayd J; Rundle, Chandler W; Dunnick, Cory A","Dermatitis : contact, atopic, occupational, drug",602,16

Here, we combine depth-resolved Doppler broadening and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopies to identify vacancy clusters in ion-irradiated Fe and measure their density as a function of depth. Despite large concentrations of dislocations and voids in the pristine samples, positron annihilation measurements uncovered the structure of vacancy clusters and the change in their size and density with irradiation dose. When combined with transmission electron microscopy measurements, the study demonstrates an association between the increase in the density of small vacancy clusters with irradiation and a remarkable reduction in the size of large voids. This, previously unknown, mechanism for the interaction of cascade damage with voids in ion-irradiated materials is a consequence of the high porosity of the initial microstructure.","Agarwal, S; Liedke, M O; Jones, A C L; Reed, E; Kohnert, A A; Uberuaga, B P; Wang, Y Q; Cooper, J; Kaoumi, D; Li, N; Auguste, R; Hosemann, P; Capolungo, L; Edwards, D J; Butterling, M; Hirschmann, E; Wagner, A; Selim, F A",Science advances,602,1

Hence, the vaccine development and clinical trials are carried on in an accelerated rate. At that, success of any mass immunization program, including its global application, directly depends on population willingness to be vaccinated. The purpose of the study is to investigate opinions about COVID-19 vaccination in various countries and to identify factors contributing to or hindering to increasing commitment to immunization. METHODS AND MATERIALS The search of relevant data was implemented through such bibliographic databases as eLIBRARY.RU, PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus and Google Scholar. Moreover, the primary research data concerning opinions of Russians about coronavirus infection vaccination was analyzed. RESULTS The cross-country study of opinions about COVID-19 vaccination permitted to identify main factors impacting degree of readiness to mass immunization, including fear and personal perceptions of risk of COVID-19 infection, attitudes to influenza vaccination and fear of vaccination, mainly due to disinformation about efficiency, efficacy and safety of the vaccine. CONCLUSION The conclusion was made that public opinion surveys implemented in various countries are important because they provide priceless information for implementing public policy targeted to improve health care support, in particular to develop effective vaccination campaigns against COVID-19, identifying high-risk groups, socially and economically vulnerable individuals for whom vaccination is to be paramount and free, and also setting vaccination fees for other groups based on their readiness to pay.","Vosheva, N A; Kamynina, N N; Korotkova, E O; Voshev, D V","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",602,1

Adipose tissue is generally linked to excessive body fat, and it is well known that the female breast is rich in adipose tissue. Hence, one can wonder: what is the role of adipose tissue in the breast and why is it required? Adipose tissue as an organ consists of adipocytes, an extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune cells, with a significant role in the dynamics of breast changes throughout the life span of a female breast from puberty, pregnancy, lactation and involution. In this review, we will discuss the importance of breast adipose tissue in breast development and its involvement in breast changes happening during pregnancy, lactation and involution. We will focus on understanding the biology of breast adipose tissue, with an overview on its involvement in the various steps of breast cancer development and progression. The interaction between the breast adipose tissue surrounding cancer cells and vice-versa modifies the tumor microenvironment in favor of cancer. Understanding this mutual interaction and the role of breast adipose tissue in the tumor microenvironment could potentially raise the possibility of overcoming breast adipose tissue mediated resistance to therapies and finding novel candidates to target breast cancer.","Kothari, Charu; Diorio, Caroline; Durocher, Francine",International journal of molecular sciences,602,1

METHODS A prospective single-center cohort study of HTx recipients who received a 2-dose SARSCoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech). Whole blood for anti-spike IgG (S-IgG) antibodies were drawn at days 21-26 and at days 35-40 after the first vaccine dose. Geometric mean titers (GMT) ≥50 AU/mL were interpreted positive. RESULTS Included were 42 HTx recipients at a median age of 61 (IQR 44, 69) years. Median time from HTx to the 1st vaccine dose was 9.1 (IQR 2.6, 14) years. Only 15% of HTx recipients demonstrated the presence of positive S-IgG antibody titers in response to the 1st vaccine dose (GMT 90 (IQR 54, 229) AU/mL). Forty-nine percent of HTx recipients induced S-IgG antibodies in response to either the 1st or the full 2-dose vaccine schedule (GMT 426 (IQR 106, 884) AU/mL). Older age (68 (IQR 59, 70) years vs. 46 (IQR 34, 63) years, p=0.034) and anti-metabolites-based immunosuppression protocols (89% vs. 44%, p=0.011) were associated with low immunogenicity. Importantly, 36% of HTx recipients who were non-responders to 1st vaccine dose became S-IgG seropositive in response to the 2nd vaccine dose. DISCUSSION Approximately a half of HTx recipients did not generate S-IgG antibodies following SARSCoV-2 2-dose vaccine. The generally achieved protection from SARSCoV-2 mRNA vaccination should be regarded with caution in the population of HTx recipients. The possible benefit of additive vaccine doses should be further studied.","Itzhaki Ben Zadok, Osnat; Shaul, Aviv A; Ben-Avraham, Binyamin; Yaari, Vicky; Ben Zvi, Haim; Shostak, Yael; Pertzov, Barak; Eliakim-Raz, Noa; Abed, Galia; Abuhazira, Miriam; Barac, Yaron D; Mats, Israel; Kramer, Mordehay; Aravot, Dan; Kornowski, Ran; Ben-Gal, Tuvia",European journal of heart failure,602,16

Methods Stool samples were collected from patients with urolithiasis and healthy patients between March and December 2017. The samples were analyzed by 16S sequencing to determine differences in the microbiome profiles between the two groups. The mouse model was established and was divided into two groups. Fecal samples were collected from the mice before gavage and three weeks postgavage for microbiome analysis. The microbial population of each group was analyzed to screen for microbial species that may affect the formation of urinary stones. Differences in the number of crystals in the renal tubules of the mice were examined by necropsy. Results The microbial composition was different between urolithiasis patients and healthy controls. The urolithiasis patients had significantly reduced microbial abundance; however, increased proportions of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were detected compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, the abundance of Alistipesindistinctus and Odoribactersplanchnicus was significantly increased in the urolithiasis patients compared to the healthy controls. In addition, the incidence of urolithiasis was much higher in the experimental mouse group (stone solution + urolithiasis patient stool) than in the control mouse group. However, the microbial abundance before gavage was not significantly different from that seen three weeks postgavage. Conclusion Theurolithiasis patients in this study had a different gut microbiome when compared with that of healthy individuals. The altered microbiome increased the rate of crystal formation in renal tubules and accelerated urinary stone formation in the mouse model of urolithiasis.","Zhou, Chenhao; Li, Kai; Zhao, Lun; Li, Wei; Guo, Zongbao; Xu, Jingyao; Qi, Xiaofei; Yuan, Hexing",BioMed research international,602,12

Objective To perform meta-analyses that assess the CV and kidney outcomes of all 4 available SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data Sources A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2020. Study Selection One hundred forty-five records were initially identified; 137 were excluded because of study design or topic of interest. As a result, a total of 6 randomized, placebo-controlled CV and kidney outcomes trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes were identified, with contributory data from 9 publications. All analyses were conducted on the total patient population of these trials. Data Extraction and Synthesis Standardized data search and abstraction were performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement. Data were analyzed using a fixed-effect model. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included time to the first event of (1) the composite of major adverse CV events of myocardial infarction, stroke, or CV death, and each component, (2) the composite of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or CV death (HHF/CV death) and each component, and (3) kidney composite outcomes. For outcomes in the overall trial populations and in selected subgroups, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were pooled and meta-analyzed across trials. Results Data from 6 trials comprised 46 969 unique patients with type 2 diabetes, including 31 116 (66.2%) with atherosclerotic CV disease. The mean (SD) age of all trial participants was 63.7 (7.9) years; 30 939 (65.9%) were men, and 36 849 (78.5%) were White. The median number of participants per trial was 8246 (range, 4401-17 160). Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.95; Q statistic, P = .27), HHF/CV death (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.84; Q statistic, P = .09), and kidney outcomes (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.70; Q statistic, P = .09), with no significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome. Associated risk reduction for HHF was consistent across the trials (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61-0.76; I2 = 0.0%), whereas significant heterogeneity of associations with outcome was observed for CV death (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93; Q statistic, P = .02; I2 = 64.3%). The presence or absence of atherosclerotic CV disease did not modify the association with outcomes for major adverse CV events (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95 and HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83-1.07, respectively; P = .63 for interaction), with similar absence of associations with outcome modification by prevalent atherosclerotic CV disease for HHF/CV death (P = .62 for interaction), HHF (P = .26 for interaction), or kidney outcomes (P = .73 for interaction). Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-analysis, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of major adverse CV events; in addition, results suggest significant heterogeneity in associations with CV death. The largest benefit across the class was for an associated reduction in risk for HHF and kidney outcomes, with benefits for HHF risk being the most consistent observation across the trials.","McGuire, Darren K; Shih, Weichung J; Cosentino, Francesco; Charbonnel, Bernard; Cherney, David Z I; Dagogo-Jack, Samuel; Pratley, Richard; Greenberg, Michelle; Wang, Shuai; Huyck, Susan; Gantz, Ira; Terra, Steven G; Masiukiewicz, Urszula; Cannon, Christopher P",JAMA cardiology,602,1

The edaphoclimatic zoning was based on the overlapping of maps that characterize the average annual air temperature obtained by multiple linear regression, annual water deficiency calculated by the Thornthwaite and Matter method (1955) and favorable soil classes to the development of papaya. The results indicated that as regards the edaphoclimatic zoning for the papaya crop it was observed that 71.70% of the area is classified as apt for its development. In relation to agrometeorological favorability for the occurrence of fungal diseases, there was a favorability of 7.64% for the development without restrictions of the oidium and a predominance of 64,56% of favorability with thermal restriction. For the early blight fungus, it was observed that the zones of favorability without restriction correspond to 11.66% of the area apt for the papaya cultivation and that 55.13% of the area has favorability with restriction of humidity. The edaphoclimatic zoning for the papaya crop showed compatibility with the most productive areas of this crop in the state of Espírito Santo. The zoning of thermal favorability for the occurrence of papaya fungal diseases proved to be a valuable tool for studies of plant diseases, allowing the establishment of plans for the allocation of resistant varieties, in order to minimize the risks of loss of crop productivity due to the disease.

Both motor attention and motor planning alter somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in healthy adults. This study's aim was to examine the effect of motor attention on processing of irrelevant somatosensory information during plantar flexion motor planning after stroke. Thirteen healthy older adults and 11 individuals with stroke participated. Irrelevant tibial nerve stimulation was delivered while SEPs were recorded over Cz, overlaying the leg portion of the sensorimotor cortex at the vertex of the head. Three conditions were tested in both legs: (1) Rest, (2) Attend To, and (3) Attend Away from the stimulated limb. In conditions 2 and 3, relevant vibration cued voluntary plantar flexion movements of the stimulated (Attend To) or non-stimulated (Attend Away) leg. SEP amplitudes were averaged during motor planning per condition. Individuals with stroke did not show attention-mediated gating of the N40 component associated with irrelevant somatosensory information during motor planning. It may be that dysfunction in pathways connecting to area 3b explains the lack of attention-mediated gating of the N40. Also, attention-mediated gating during motor planning explained significant and unique variance in a measure of community balance and mobility combined with response time. Thus, the ability to gate irrelevant somatosensory information appears important for stepping in both older adults and after stroke. Our data suggest that therapies that direct motor attention could positively impact walking after stroke.","Peters, Sue; Brown, Katlyn E; Garland, S Jayne; Staines, W Richard; Handy, Todd C; Boyd, Lara A",The European journal of neuroscience,602,1

Pattern replication is expected when both the blend composition ratio matches the surface patterning area ratio, and the pattern periodicity matches the natural phase separation length scale. By varying film thickness and blend composition, we show that ordered morphologies also result for contrary situations, resulting in the formation of a rich variety of hierarchically-ordered microstructures. This hierarchy suggests that non-equilibrium structures generated by incomplete phase separation of blend components are locked in by rapid solvent quenching during casting.","Andrew, Piers; Huck, Wilhelm T S",Soft matter,602,1

We used the well-established Drosophila activity monitor (DAM) to investigate the effects of the conserved NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway on functional senescence.

Our program intends to determine the feasibility of high-fidelity simulation for teaching CRM to an interprofessional team in a community hospital and whether a microdebriefing intervention can improve performance during simulated pediatric resuscitation. METHODS We conducted a single-center prospective interventional study with 24 teams drawn from 4 departments. The program was divided into an initial assessment simulation case (pre), a 40-minute microdebriefing intervention, and a final assessment simulation case (post). Post and pre results were analyzed for each team using t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Primary outcome measures included (a) completion of program, (b) percent enrollment, (c) participant reaction, and (d) support of continued programs on completion. Secondary outcomes included (a) change in teamwork performance, measured by the Clinical Teamwork Scale; (b) change in time to initiation of chest compressions and defibrillation; and (c) pediatric advanced life support adherence, measured by the Clinical Performance Tool. RESULTS We successfully completed a large-scale training program with high enrollment. Twenty-four teams with 162 participants improved in Clinical Teamwork Scale scores (42.8%-57.5%, P < 0.001), Clinical Performance Tool scores (61.7%-72.1%, P < 0.001), and time to cardiopulmonary resuscitation initiation (70.6-34.3 seconds, P < 0.001).

Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) is the most common form of image guidance during liver surgery. However, during laparoscopic hepatectomies (LH), IOUS has several limitations and its reliability has been poorly evaluated. The objective of this work is to evaluate VRCT (virtual real-time CT-guided volume navigation) during LH. This system aims to provide accurate anatomical orientation for surgeons enhancing the safety of LH. METHODS Twenty-seven hepatic neoplasms were resected laparoscopically at our institution under reference guidance of VRCT. During operation, electromagnetic tracking of the surgical instrument was used for navigating the direction of accurate liver transection. RESULTS Twenty-six (96.3%) of the 27 lesions (mean diameter 11 mm) were successfully performed under VRCT guidance. Average registration time was < 2 min. Average setup time was approximately 7 min per procedure. VRCT allows the surgeon to navigate liver transection with acceptable accuracy. The mean error was 12 mm. All surgical margins were negative and the mean histologic resection margin was 9 mm. CONCLUSIONS VRCT-guided LH is feasible and provides valuable real-time anatomical feedback during hepatic resections. Advancement of such systems to improve accuracy might greatly compensate for the limitation of laparoscopic IOUS.","Aoki, Takeshi; Mansour, Doaa A; Koizumi, Tomotake; Wada, Yusuke; Enami, Yuta; Fujimori, Akira; Kusano, Tomokazu; Matsuda, Kazuhiro; Nogaki, Koji; Tashiro, Yoshihiko; Hakozaki, Tomoki; Shibata, Hideki; Tomioka, Kodai; Hirai, Takahito; Yamazaki, Tatsuya; Saito, Kazuhiko; Goto, Satoru; Watanabe, Makoto; Otsuka, Koji; Murakami, Masahiko",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,602,1

However, the value of preoperative platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of PLR as a preoperative prognostic factor for resectable pancreatic cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Systematic literature search was conducted for studies assessing PLR influence as a preoperative prognostic factor in resectable pancreatic cancer patients. Random-effects model was applied for pooling hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals related to overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS Fourteen articles with 2,743 patients were included in the study. According to the analysis, high PLR had no correlation with decreased OS. Due to high heterogeneity among studies, subgroup analysis was performed. Better OS was associated with low PLR in Asian patients, patients with mixed type of operation performed, and patients with preoperative PLR ≤150. Low PLR was associated with significantly better DFS. CONCLUSIONS PLR is a predictive factor of better DFS in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. However, available evidence does not support PLR as a reliable prognostic factor for OS.","Riauka, Romualdas; Ignatavicius, Povilas; Barauskas, Giedrius",Digestive surgery,602,29

A chronic fistula at the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) is a rare but life-threatening complication of this procedure whose causes are still unclear and management is still controversial. METHODS A 41-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 38 developed an EGJ leak 6 days post-LSG. Despite initial control with conservative measures, the leak persisted and resulted in a left pleural abscess and a broncho-pleural fistula requiring thoracotomy with resection of the abscessed lung parenchyma. Endoscopic and drainage procedures failed to prevent subdiaphragmatic recurring collection due to the persistent fistula. Nineteen months after LSG, a Roux limb was placed on the EGJ and sutured side to side around the fistula defect, without mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis. RESULTS The postoperative course was uneventful and, 20 months later (39 months post-LSG), the patient is well with a BMI of 27. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic apposition of a Roux-en-Y limb without mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis as an efferent path to drain the undebrided fistula defect can effectively treat chronic leaks at the EGJ after LSG.","Iannelli, Antonio; Tavana, Reza; Martini, Francesco; Noel, Patrick; Gugenheim, Jean",Obesity surgery,602,1

PURPOSE To describe the clinical presentation and operative management of a patient diagnosed with an intradural extramedullary thoracic HPC that was missed on initial workup. We also describe the pathologic features of HPC. STUDY DESIGN Case report. METHODS Chart review and literature search. CASE A 58-year-old man presented with acute weakness of the lower extremities and bladder and bowel incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging of his spine revealed a T10 intradural extramedullary lesion that displaced the cord to the right. RESULTS The patient was taken emergently to surgery for T9-T11 laminectomy and en bloc resection of the tumor. The lesion was identified and resected. Histology revealed randomly oriented tumor cells with irregular capillaries consistent with HPC. Postoperatively, the patient had an improved neurological examination, and he continued to do so with intense physical therapy. CONCLUSION The standard treatment for HPC is surgery when the lesion is resectable. Despite gross total resection, there is still a high risk of recurrence and metastasis; therefore, patients should be followed up closely by their physicians with serial postoperative clinical examinations and radiographic imaging.","Ackerman, Paul D; Khaldi, Ahmad; Shea, John F",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,602,5

However, few studies have investigated changes in regional cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in PDM patients. The purpose of this study was to characterize differences in both cortical thickness and subcortical volumes between PDM patients and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained from 44 PDM patients and 32 HCs matched for age and handedness. Cortical thickness was compared in multiple locations across the continuous cortical surface, and subcortical volumes were compared on a structure-by-structure basis. Correlation analysis was then used to evaluate relationships between the clinical symptoms and abnormal brain structure in PDM. RESULTS PDM patients had significantly increased cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula (IN), primary/secondary sensory area (SI/SII), superior temporal cortex (STC), precuneus (pCUN) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Meanwhile, significantly decreased subcortical volumes of the caudate, thalamus and amygdala were found in PDM patients. Moreover, there were significant positive correlations between the PDM-related duration and the OFC, SFC, STC and IN. The MPQ scores were positively correlated with the pCUN. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide further evidence for grey matter changes in patients with PDM, and in addition, the results support relationships between the structural abnormalities and their role in symptom production. All these results are likely to be potential valuable to provide us with direct information about the neural basis of PDM.","Liu, P; Yang, J; Wang, G; Liu, Y; Liu, X; Jin, L; Liang, F; Qin, W; Calhoun, V D",European journal of pain,602,1

However, the quantitative and qualitative measures of protein intrinsic disorder in species with known genomes are still not available. Furthermore, although the correlation between high fraction of disordered residues and advanced species has been reported, the details of this correlation and the connection between the disorder content and proteome complexity have not been reported as of yet. To fill this gap, we analysed entire proteomes of 3484 species from three domains of life (archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes) and from viruses. Our analysis revealed that the evolution process is characterized by distinctive patterns of changes in the protein intrinsic disorder content. We are showing here that viruses are characterized by the widest spread of the proteome disorder content (the percentage of disordered residues ranges from 7.3% in human coronavirus NL63 to 77.3% in Avian carcinoma virus). For several organisms, a clear correlation is seen between their disorder contents and habitats. In multicellular eukaryotes, there is a weak correlation between the complexity of an organism (evaluated as a number of different cell types) and its overall disorder content. For both the prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the disorder content is generally independent of the proteome size. However, disorder shows a sharp increase associated with the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells. This suggests that the increased disorder content in eukaryotic proteomes might be used by nature to deal with the increased cell complexity due to the appearance of the various cellular compartments.","Xue, Bin; Dunker, A Keith; Uversky, Vladimir N",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,602,7

The objective of our study was to determine the presence of sleep disorders in US military personnel referred for evaluation of sleep disturbances after deployment and examine associations between sleep disorders and service-related diagnoses of depression, mild traumatic brain injury, pain, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of military personnel with sleep disturbances who returned from combat within 18 months of deployment. Sleep disorders were assessed by clinical evaluation and polysomnogram with validated instruments to diagnose service-related illnesses. RESULTS Of 110 military personnel included in our analysis, 97.3% were men (mean age, 33.6 ± 8.0 years; mean BMI, 30.0 ± 4.3 kg/m2), and 70.9% returned from combat within 12 months. Nearly one-half (47.3%) met diagnostic criteria for two or more service-related diagnoses. Sleep disorders were diagnosed in 88.2% of subjects; 11.8% had a normal sleep evaluation and served as control subjects. Overall, 62.7% met diagnostic criteria for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 63.6% for insomnia. The exclusive diagnoses of insomnia and OSA were present in 25.5% and 24.5% of subjects, respectively; 38.2% had comorbid insomnia and OSA. Military personnel with comorbid insomnia and OSA were significantly more likely to meet criteria for depression (P < .01) and PTSD (P < .01) compared with control subjects and those with OSA only. CONCLUSIONS Comorbid insomnia and OSA is a frequent diagnosis in military personnel referred for evaluation of sleep disturbances after deployment.

Aeromonas is a highly heterogeneous group of bacteria, and the heterogeneity of the genus is attributed to variation and diversity in the virulence factors and toxins among various Aeromonas strains. One of the major toxins aerolysin, secreted by the bacterium, causes hemorrhagic-septicemia and diarrhea and can serve as a drug target. Here, we describe characterization, molecular phylogeny, and homology modeling of the aerolysin of A. hydrophila strain EUS112 (AhEUS112) cloned in our lab. The encoded aerolysin is 485 amino acids long with an N-terminal signal sequence of 23 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of the aerolysin of AhEUS112 revealed that it belongs to a diverse group of toxins, showing maximum similarity with aerolysins of other Aeromonas strains followed by Vibrio toxin. The homology model of the mature aerolysin of AhEUS112 was generated using the crystal structure of a mutant aerolysin (PDB#3g4n) as the template, which showed that the encoded aerolysin exists as a channel protein. Validation of the generated model using bioinformatics tool confirmed it to be a good quality model that can be used for drug design. Molecular dock analysis revealed that drugs, aralia-saponin I, cyclamin, ardisiacrispin B, and aralia-saponin II bind to aerolysin with a higher affinity as compared to other drugs and at functionally important amino acids of aerolysin. Hence, these molecules can act as an effective therapeutics for inhibiting the aerolysin pore formation and curtail the severity of Aeromonas infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The femoral approach is possible in 80% of cases and remains the access of choice. When this approach is not feasible, other alternative routes have been proposed such as transapical, transaortic and subclavian. Transcarotid aortic valve implantation has been proposed as another direct vascular access. Its use is relatively new and still under evaluation. METHODS We successfully performed transcarotid aortic valve implantation in 145 consecutive patients through the left or right carotid artery in 3 different French sites over a 2-year period. Data were prospectively entered in the French transcatheter aortic valve implantation database. RESULTS The mean age was 79.8 ± 8.7 years, with a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 20.7 ± 12.6%. The procedure was successful in all patients, and no conversion was necessary. Thirty-day survival was 93.7%, 8 (5.5%) patients presented either minor or major strokes and 1 patient had a localized asymptomatic carotid dissection. All patients were immediately extubated, and none presented respiratory complications. CONCLUSIONS Transcarotid aortic valve implantation is a safe alternative to transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation, with direct access to the aortic valve, which can be performed with limited incision.","Folliguet, Thierry; Laurent, Nicolas; Bertram, Maxime; Zannis, Konstantinos; Elfarra, Mazen; Vanhuyse, Fabrice; Maureira, Pablo; Modine, Thomas",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,602,1

RECENT FINDINGS The neurologic examination has served as the primary monitor for secondary brain injury in patients admitted to the neurocritical care unit. However, the International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring in Neurocritical Care concluded that frequent bedside examinations are not sufficient to detect and prevent secondary brain injury and that integration of multimodality monitoring with advanced informatics tools will most likely enhance our assessments compared to the clinical examinations alone. This article reviews the invasive and noninvasive technologies used to monitor focal and global neurophysiologic cerebral alterations.

Bariatric surgery has been shown to resolve or improve CVD risk factors, to varying degrees. The objective of this systematic review was to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on CV risk factors and mortality. A systematic review of the published research was performed to evaluate evidence regarding CV outcomes in morbidly obese bariatric patients. Two major databases (PubMed and the Cochrane Library) were searched. The review included all original reports reporting outcomes after bariatric surgery, published in English, from January 1950 to July 2010. In total, 637 studies were identified from the initial screen. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 52 studies involving 16,867 patients were included (mean age 42 years, 78% women). The baseline prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia was 49%, 28%, and 46%, respectively. Mean follow-up was 34 months (range 3 to 155), and the average excess weight loss was 52% (range 16% to 87%). Most studies reported significant decreases postoperatively in the prevalence of CV risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Mean systolic pressure reduced from to 139 to 124 mm Hg and diastolic pressure from 87 to 77 mm Hg. C-reactive protein decreased, endothelial function improved, and a 40% relative risk reduction for 10-year coronary heart disease risk was observed, as determined by the Framingham risk score. In conclusion, this review highlights the benefits of bariatric surgery in reducing or eliminating risk factors for CVD. It provides further evidence to support surgical treatment of obesity to achieve CVD risk reduction.","Heneghan, Helen M; Meron-Eldar, Shai; Brethauer, Stacy A; Schauer, Philip R; Young, James B",The American journal of cardiology,602,14

This required a concomitant shift in the way health workers communicated ART initiation messages. We provide insight into front-line ART initiation communication pre-national policy shift.Method: The design of this study was exploratory with a case descriptive analysis of ART initiation in three clinics. To characterise their demographic profiles, we reviewed 134 randomly selected patient clinical folders of people who initiated ART at CD4 counts greater than the recommended standard. Further, we conducted 12 key informant interviews with health workers at these facilities and thematically analysed health workers' responses.Results: The median age of patients initiating ART regardless of CD4 count (above the threshold level) was 33 years and most were women (73.9%), married (76.1%), and unemployed (48.5%). The median CD4 count of patients initiating outside guidelines was 566.5 cells/µl. Contrary to expectations, key informants indicated no radical shift in messaging to explain ART initiation regardless of CD4 count. Rather, they encouraged people living with HIV (PLHIV) to initiate ART while they still ""feel well"". The reduced risk of onward HIV transmission did not factor significantly in how health workers motivated clients.Conclusion: Motivating PLHIV to initiate ART regardless of CD4 count in high burden settings is possible. However, there are still opportunities to improve messaging about immediate ART initiation or at high CD4 counts for the prevention of onward transmission.","Mubekapi-Musadaidzwa, Constance; Wademan, Dillon; Peton, Neshaan; Hendricks, Portia; Carolus, Gabriela; Mbaezue, Rheiner; Kelley, Karen F; Kruger, James; Jennings, Karen; Grobbelaar, Nelis; Louis, Francoise; Beyers, Nulda; Ayles, Helen; Fidler, Sarah; Hayes, Richard; Bock, Peter; Hoddinott, Graeme",African journal of AIDS research : AJAR,602,16

Evidence suggests that whey protein (WP) provides satiety via gastrointestinal hormone secretion.

Thus, we sought to compare the effect of acute supplementation of WP or hydrolysed collagen on post-intervention appetite and energy consumption. This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot study with 10 healthy adult women (22.4 y/o) who were submitted to acute intake (single dose) of a beverage containing WP (40 g of concentrated WP) or hydrolysed collagen (40 g). Subjective appetite ratings (feelings of hunger, desire to eat and full stomach) were measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), energy intake was quantified by ad libitum cheese bread consumption 2 hours after supplementation and blood was collected for leptin and glucose determination.

As obesity is strongly associated with socio-economic status, excluding its use from the public system will deny many of the most in-need access to a potentially very effective treatment. Alternatively, with rigorous follow-up and behavioural change requirements, highly successful outcomes in the private system may not translate to the public system. METHODS The Alfred Hospital rapidly expanded bariatric surgery from 2007. A 6-year prospective follow-up study was conducted with annual review of weight, co-morbidities, retention in follow-up, serum HbA1c, quality of life and patient satisfaction. RESULTS There were 1453 patients. Procedures were predominantly laparoscopic-adjustable gastric bands (n = 861). Patient details were age 49 ± 11 years, body mass index 50.7 ± 11.2 kg/m(2) and weight 139.0 ± 30.2 kg. There was no mortality, and mean length of stay was 1.1 ± 1.2 days. Follow-up was 98% (1 year) and 85% (6 years). Weight loss was 22 ± 13.1 kg (32.8 ± 18% excess weight loss) at 1 and 30.1 ± 16.8 kg (60 ± 28%) at 6 years. The mean number of co-morbidities was 4.2 ± 1.1 with significant improvements observed. Patient satisfaction was 7.7 ± 2.3 out of 10. Mental and physical summary scores (SF-36) improved from 41.02 ± 13.17 to 45.50 ± 13.27 (P < 0.001) and 33.97 ± 10.53 to 44.79 ± 11.19 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Patients were older, heavier and suffered more co-morbid disease than previously reported cohorts.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of CMB detected with pretreatment susceptibility-weighted MRI on ICH occurrence and outcome. METHODS From 2010 to 2013 we treated 724 patients with intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, or intravenous thrombolysis followed by endovascular therapy. A total of 392 of the 724 patients were examined with susceptibility-weighted MRI before treatment. CMBs were rated retrospectively. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine the impact of CMB on ICH and outcome. RESULTS Of 392 patients, 174 were treated with intravenous thrombolysis, 150 with endovascular therapy, and 68 with intravenous thrombolysis followed by endovascular therapy. CMBs were detected in 79 (20.2%) patients. Symptomatic ICH occurred in 21 (5.4%) and asymptomatic in 75 (19.1%) patients, thereof 61 (15.6%) bleedings within and 35 (8.9%) outside the infarct. Neither the existence of CMB, their burden, predominant location nor their presumed pathogenesis influenced the risk for symptomatic or asymptomatic ICH. A higher CMB burden marginally increased the risk for ICH outside the infarct (P=0.048; odds ratio, 1.004; 95% confidence interval, 1.000-1.008). CONCLUSIONS CMB detected on pretreatment susceptibility-weighted MRI did not increase the risk for ICH or worsen outcome, even when CMB burden, predominant location, or presumed pathogenesis was considered. There was only a small increased risk for ICH outside the infarct with increasing CMB burden that does not advise against thrombolysis in such patients.","Gratz, Pascal P; El-Koussy, Marwan; Hsieh, Kety; von Arx, Sebastian; Mono, Marie-Luise; Heldner, Mirjam Rachel; Fischer, Urs; Mattle, Heinrich P; Zubler, Christoph; Schroth, Gerhard; Gralla, Jan; Arnold, Marcel; Jung, Simon",Stroke,602,28

SARS-CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral genomic RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with homopolymeric RNA substrates that do not form base pairing interactions, it forms asymmetric condensates with viral RNA strands. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (CLMS) identified a region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. We also identified small molecules that alter the formation of N protein condensates and inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells. These results suggest that the N protein may utilize biomolecular condensation to package the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome into a viral particle.","Jack, Amanda; Ferro, Luke S; Trnka, Michael J; Wehri, Eddie; Nadgir, Amrut; Nguyenla, Xammy; Fox, Douglas; Costa, Katelyn; Stanley, Sarah; Schaletzky, Julia; Yildiz, Ahmet",PLoS biology,602,31

Malaria is also an established risk factor for invasive bacterial disease caused, in the majority of cases, by invasive enteropathogens and in particular by non-Typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). Whilst various malaria-related pathologies have been implicated in the risk of NTS bacteraemia in animal models, including intestinal dysbiosis and loss of gut homeostasis, clinical evidence is lacking. As a first step in gathering such evidence, we conducted a systematic review of clinical and epidemiological studies reporting the prevalence of diarrhoea among malaria cases and vice versa. Database searches for ""plasmodium"" and ""diarrhoea"" identified 1,771 articles; a search for ""plasmodium"" and ""gastroenteritis"" identified a further 215 articles. After review, 66 articles specified an association between the search terms and referred primarily, but not exclusively, to Plasmodium falciparum infections. Overall, between 1.6 and 44% of patients with acute malaria infection reported symptoms of diarrhoea (812 of 7,267 individuals, 11%) whereas 5-42% of patients presenting to hospital with diarrhoea had an underlying malaria parasite infection (totaling 749 of 2,937 individuals, 26%). However, given the broad range of estimates, a paucity of purposeful case control or longitudinal studies, and varied or poorly specified definitions of diarrhoea, the literature provides limited evidence to draw any firm conclusions. The relationship between malaria and gastrointestinal disturbance thus remains unclear.

Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) involves introducing large amounts of CI material well within the stratosphere to enhance the aerosol loading, thereby increasing reflection of solar radiation. We explore a delivery method termed solar-powered lofting (SPL) that uses solar energy to loft CI material injected at lower altitudes accessible by conventional aircraft. Particles that absorb solar radiation are dispersed with the CI material and heat the surrounding air. The heated air rises, carrying the CI material to the stratosphere. Global model simulations show that black carbon aerosol (10 microgram per cubic meter) is sufficient to quickly loft CI material well into the stratosphere. SPL could make SAI viable at present, is also more energy efficient, and disperses CI material faster than direct stratospheric injection.","Gao, Ru-Shan; Rosenlof, Karen H; Kärcher, Bernd; Tilmes, Simone; Toon, Owen B; Maloney, Christopher; Yu, Pengfei",Science advances,602,7

In a response to these developments, we examine the current and past limitations of the ways in which bioethicists have considered race and, more generally, discourses of marginalization. We argue that the foundational principle of justice necessitates that bioethics, as an institution, maintain an active voice against systemic injustice. To carry out this charge, bioethics as a field should promote alternative narratives-""counter storytelling""-to the mainstream voices that have traditionally been heard and accepted, largely without opposition. Additionally, we engage with both Post-Colonial and Critical Race Theory, which we believe are important tools for bioethics in pursuit of equity. Ultimately, we advocate for a proactive form of bioethics that actively resists and denounces injustice and which considers a much wider variety of voices about justice than bioethics has historically considered.","Mithani, Zamina; Cooper, Jane; Boyd, J Wesley",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,602,1

However, a considerable number of patients are ineligible for IV thrombolysis due to various contraindications. Recent studies have proved the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy for patients with large-vessel occlusions in combination with IV rtPA compared with IV rtPA alone. We aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy for patients who are ineligible for IV rtPA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients from the stroke registries of 4 dedicated centers who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy from January 2010 to October 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Inclusion criteria were the following: acute stroke due to proved large-artery occlusion, ineligibility for IV thrombolysis, and a timeframe of ≤4.5 hours between stroke and the start of mechanical thrombectomy. Recanalization success, periprocedural complications, clinical outcome, and hemorrhages were evaluated. RESULTS One hundred thirty endovascular recanalization procedures were identified. The locations were the following: proximal ICA in 17 (13.1%), terminus ICA in 25 (19.2%), M1 segment in 77 (59.2%), and M2 segment in 11 (8.5%). TICI 2b/3 results were achieved in 101 (77.7%), and an mRS score of 0-2 in 47 patients (37.9%). There was a significant correlation between TICI 2b/3 results and good clinical outcomes (87.2% versus 6.8%; P = .048). A good clinical result was most frequent when recanalization was achieved within 4.5 hours (37/74 = 50% versus 10/50 = 20.0%; P = .001). Symptomatic hemorrhage occurred in 13.1% of patients; mortality was 24.2%. Periprocedural complications were recorded in 10 patients (7.7%). CONCLUSIONS Mechanical thrombectomy can achieve good clinical outcomes in patients with acute large-artery occlusion ineligible for IV thrombolysis, in particular when recanalization is reached early.","Dorn, F; Prothmann, S; Patzig, M; Lockau, H; Kabbasch, C; Nikoubashman, O; Liebig, T; Zimmer, C; Brückmann, H; Wiesmann, M; Stetefeld, H; Poppert, H; Reich, A; Kellert, L; Fesl, G",AJNR.

TECHNIQUE The first FEVAR procedure performed at another center implanted a standard Zenith device with 2 fenestrations and 1 scallop for a juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. The diameter of the Crawford type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm had progressed from 68 to 75 mm within a year after the FEVAR. Since the celiac trunk was already occluded, a 3-fenestration 22-×172-mm stent-graft was chosen to extend the existing stent-graft further proximally. A tapered 38/22-×179-mm Zenith custom-made device was designed for the thoracic component. The technique addresses several issues that arise during a FEVAR-in-FEVAR case, such as the orientation of the new stent-graft and its fenestrations, the absence of space between the 2 devices for maneuvers, and the difficulty in catheterizing target vessels with existing bridging stents, for which a bailout ""snare-ride"" maneuver is described. CONCLUSION FEVAR after previous FEVAR is a feasible and efficient treatment option. The modified ""snare-ride"" technique can be used to catheterize target vessels in the absence of an Indy snare.","Spanos, Konstantinos; Tsilimparis, Nikolaos; Heidemann, Franziska; Rohlffs, Fiona; Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Debus, Eike Sebastian; Kölbel, Tilo",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,602,31

Initially, this model was believed to create very reproducible fractures. However, there have been frequent reports of comminution and varying rates of complication. Given the importance of precise anticipation of those characteristics in laboratory research, we aimed to precisely estimate the rate of comminution, its importance and its effect on the amount of soft callus created. Furthermore, we aimed to precisely report the rate of complications such as death and infection. METHODS We tested a rat model of femoral fracture on 84 rats based on Bonnarens' original description. We used a proximal approach with trochanterotomy to insert the pin, a drop tower to create the fracture and a high-resolution fluoroscopic imager to detect the comminution. We weighed the soft callus on day seven and compared the soft callus parameters with the comminution status. RESULTS The mean operating time was 34.8 minutes (sd 9.8). The fracture was usable (transverse, mid-shaft, without significant comminution and with displacement < 1 mm) in 74 animals (88%). Of these 74 usable fractures, slight comminution was detected in 47 (63%). In 50 animals who underwent callus manipulation, slight comminution (n = 32) was statistically correlated to the amount of early callus created (r = 0.35, p = 0.015). Two complications occurred: one death and one deep infection. CONCLUSIONS We propose an accurate description of comminution and complications in order to improve experiments on rat femur fracture model in the field of laboratory research.

RESULTS In total we reviewed 183 retinopexies, 122 in Group 1 and 61 in Group 2, a reduction of 50%. In Group 2 compared to Group 1, we showed a significant difference in characteristics of patients having primary retinopexy with an increase in proportion of male patients from 50 (41.0%) to 39 (63.9%) (p = 0.005), increase in high myopes from 1 (0.8%) to 4 (6.6%) (p = 0.043), more slit lamp laser retinopexy from 83 (68.0%) to 52 (85.2%) (p = 0.013) and less cryopexy from 21 (17.2%) to 2 (3.3%) (p = 0.008).

In the wobbler mouse, a model for human motor neuron (MN) disease, reduction in the levels of Vps54 causes neurodegeneration. However, it is unclear how disruption of the GARP complex leads to MN dysfunction. To better understand the role of Vps54 in MNs, we have disrupted expression of the Vps54 ortholog in Drosophila and examined the impact on the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Surprisingly, we show that both null mutants and MN-specific knockdown of Vps54 leads to NMJ overgrowth. Reduction of Vps54 partially disrupts localization of the t-SNARE, Syntaxin-16, to the TGN but has no visible impact on endosomal pools. MN-specific knockdown of Vps54 in MNs combined with overexpression of the small GTPases Rab5, Rab7, or Rab11 suppresses the Vps54 NMJ phenotype. Conversely, knockdown of Vps54 combined with overexpression of dominant negative Rab7 causes NMJ and behavioral abnormalities including a decrease in postysynaptic Dlg and GluRIIB levels without any effect on GluRIIA. Taken together, these data suggest that Vps54 controls larval MN axon development and postsynaptic density composition through a mechanism that requires Rab7.","Patel, Prajal H; Wilkinson, Emily C; Starke, Emily L; McGimsey, Malea R; Blankenship, J Todd; Barbee, Scott A",Biology open,602,1

A total of 1,054 Jordanian adolescents aged 12-18 completed and returned the survey. Overall, Jordanian adolescents showed a good base of knowledge regarding COVID-19 (regardless of their demographic characteristics) and tended to hold positive attitudes toward the country's curfew and other protective measures. The majority of adolescents reported that television and social media were their main source of information on COVID-19, while few reported receiving such information from their schools. The majority reported practicing effective health protective behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which was significantly predicted by their knowledge and attitudes toward these measures. However, there was a relatively small, yet clinically significant, percentage of adolescents who showed poor knowledge on COVID-19, had negative attitudes toward protective measures, and reported being engaged in risky practices related to infection spread.

However, M41 replicated in the respiratory tracts of most inoculated pheasants and the virus was shed from their respiratory tracts in the early stages of infection (4 and 8 dpc). Similarly, the attenuated IBV H120 vaccine strain also replicated and the virus was shed from their respiratory tracts of most inoculated pheasants, whereas the pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV) I0623/17 replicated in the respiratory tracts of all challenged pheasants, which then shed virus for a long period of time. Strain M41 also replicated in selected tissues of the inoculated pheasants, including the lung, kidney, proventriculus, and cecal tonsil, although the viral titers were very low. Therefore, it was important to establish whether the H120 vaccine, which has a limited replication capacity in pheasants, induces a protective immune response to both ""heterologous"" M41 and ""homologous"" I0623/17 challenge. Vaccination with H120 induced humoral responses, and the replication of M41 was reduced or restricted in the tissues of the H120-vaccinated pheasants compared with its replication in unvaccinated birds. This implies that partial protection was conferred on pheasants by vaccination with the H120 vaccine. Prolonged viral replication and a large number of birds shedding virus into the respiratory tract were also observed in the unvaccinated pheasants after inoculation with M41. However, only limited protection against challenge with PhCoV I0623/17 was conferred on pheasants vaccinated with H120, largely because the replication of H120 in pheasants was limited, thus, limiting the immune responses induced by it. The low amino acid identity of the S1 subunit of the S proteins of H120 and I0623/17 might also account, at least in part, for the poor cross-protective immunity induced by H120. These results suggest that further work is required to rationally design vaccines that confer effective protection against PhCoV infection in commercial pheasant stocks.","Han, Zongxi; Xu, Xiaochen; Li, Huixin; Zhang, Lili; Hou, Yutong; Liu, Shengwang","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",602,7

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the lockdown on surgical emergencies volumes and care in a large, tertiary referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS Electronic medical records of all patients visited in our Emergency Department (ED) and admitted in a surgical ward from February 21st 2020 to May 3rd 2020 were collected, analyzed and compared with the same periods of 2019 and 2018 and a cross-sectional study was performed. RESULTS Number of surgical admissions dropped significantly in 2020 with respect to the same periods of 2019 and 2018, by almost 50%. The percentage distribution of admissions in different surgical wards did not change over the three years.

The clinical development of nucleic acid drugs has been limited by their poor bioavailability. AREAS COVERED This review article examines the strategies that have been utilized to improve the bioavailability of nucleic acids. The chemical modifications made to nucleic acids that have improved their resistance against nuclease degradation are briefly discussed. The design of cationic and neutral lipid nanoparticles that enable the systemic delivery of nucleic acids in vivo is reviewed, and the proof-of-concept evidence that intravenous administration of nucleic acids incorporated into lipid nanoparticles leads to decreased expression of target genes in humans. Preclinical results of the neutral BP-100-1.01 nanoparticle are highlighted. EXPERT OPINION To further improve the clinical potential of nucleic acid cancer drugs, we predict research on the next generation of lipid nanoparticles will focus on: i) enhancing nucleic acid delivery to poorly vascularized tumors, as well as tumors behind the blood-brain barrier; and ii) improving the accessibility of nucleic acids to the cytoplasm by enhancing endosomal escape of nucleic acids and/or reducing exocytosis of nucleic acids to the external milieu.","Ashizawa, Ana Tari; Cortes, Jorge",Expert opinion on drug delivery,602,1

The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a public-health crisis including more than 3.1 million cases and 224,000 deaths as of May 1, 2020. Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in the same FFPE section. These reagents and assays will accelerate COVID-19 pathogenesis studies in humans and in COVID-19 animal models.","Liu, Jun; Babka, April M; Kearney, Brian J; Radoshitzky, Sheli R; Kuhn, Jens H; Zeng, Xiankun",JCI insight,602,1

Factors contributing to higher SLS rates are unknown, and knowledge of SLS prevalence within oncologic training is lacking. SLS frequency was measured for evaluations from all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited programs at a single cancer care institution between 2014 and 2018. SLS prevalence was estimated using hierarchical linear models (HLM) that considered characteristics of evaluator, trainee, and evaluation potentially related to SLS. Results were compared with national SLS rates. Six thousand one hundred sixty evaluations were included from 476 evaluators. Overall prevalence of SLS was 12.1% (95% CI 4.5-28.8). Residents (vs fellows) were less likely to have SLS evaluations (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.8), though for all trainees increasing training year corresponded with increasing SLS frequency (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). SLS was more common in procedural specialties compared with medical specialties (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.8). Formative evaluations had lower SLS rates (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) than summative evaluations, while milestone-based evaluations had higher rates than those that were not milestone-based (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.03-2.2). Features of evaluators, such as subspecialty within oncology, and of trainees, such as seniority or trainee type, were related to SLS. Summative intent and milestone-based evaluations were more likely to be straight line scored. Specific evaluation scenarios at higher risk of SLS should be further examined.","Hinchcliff, Emily; Gunther, Jillian; Ponnie, Annette Eakes; Bednarski, Brian; Onstad, Michaela; Shafer, Aaron; Frumovitz, Michael; Jazaeri, Amir; Urbauer, Diana; Bodurka, Diane C",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,602,17

METHODS We conducted a decedent cohort study of adults deceased at the ED of a Portuguese teaching hospital in 2016. PC needs were identified using the National Hospice Organization terminality criteria and comorbidities measurement by the Charlson's Index. RESULTS 384 adults died at the ED (median age 82 (IQR 72-89) years) and 78.4% (95% CI 73.9% to 82.2%) presented PC needs. Only 3.0% (n=9) were referred to the hospital PC team. 64.5%, 38.9% and 57.5% experienced dyspnoea, pain and confusion, respectively. Dyspnoea was commonly medicated (92%), against 56% for pain and 8% for confusion. Only 6.3% of the patients were spared from aggressive interventions, namely blood collection (86.0%) or intravenous fluid therapy (63.5%). The burden of aggressive interventions was similar between those with or without withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation order (median 3 (2-4) vs 3 (2-5)), p=0.082. CONCLUSIONS Nearly four out of five adults who died at the ED had PC needs at the time of admission. Most experienced poor symptom control and care aggressiveness in their last hours of life and were mostly unknown to the PC team. The findings urge improvements in the care provided to patients with PC needs at the ED, focusing on patient well-being and increased PC referral.","de Oliveira, Raquel; Lobato, Carolina B; Maia-Moço, Leonardo; Santos, Mariana; Neves, Sara; Matos, Maria Francisca; Cardoso, Rosa; Cruz, Carla; Silva, Cátia Araújo; Dias, Joana; Maçães, André; Almeida, Soraia; Gonçalves, António Pedro; Gomes, Barbara; Freire, Elga",BMJ supportive & palliative care,602,11

Regression formulae based on TCD with other parameter can be used to predict gestational age of foetus. When TCD is compared with findings in other studies in different ethnic population, it is found that there is significant difference exists. Conclusion In normally developing fetuses the TCD has linear correlation with advancing gestational age. A separate reference chart is required for every different population because ethnicity, nutrition and environmental factors can have impact on normal TCD values.

We compared clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with CAP caused by different groups of pathogens to evaluate the potential for targeted diagnostics and directed treatment. In a prospective study, conducted between April 2008 and April 2009, adult patients with CAP were tested for the presence of a broad range of possible respiratory pathogens using bacterial cultures, PCR, urinary antigen testing and serology. Of 408 patients with CAP, pathogens were detected in 263 patients (64.5%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza A virus were the most frequently identified bacterial and viral pathogens, respectively. Age had a significant effect on the prediction of aetiology (P = 0.054), with an increase in the relative contribution of viruses with advancing age. Multivariate analyses further showed that the presence of cough increased the likelihood of detecting a viral pathogen [odds ratio (OR) 5.536, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.130-14.390], the presence of immunodeficiency decreased the likelihood of detecting a bacterial pathogen (OR 0.595, 95 % CI 0.246-1.437) and an increase in pneumonia severity index score increased the likelihood of detecting a pathogen in general. Although several variables were independently associated with the detection of a pathogen group, substantial overlap meant there were no reliable clinical predictors to distinguish aetiologies. Therefore, testing for common respiratory pathogens is still necessary to optimize treatment.","Huijskens, Elisabeth G W; Koopmans, Marion; Palmen, Fernand M H; van Erkel, Adriana J M; Mulder, Paul G H; Rossen, John W A",Journal of medical microbiology,602,16

Genetic characterization of such collections has the potential to elucidate the genetic histories of important crops, use marker-trait associations to identify loci controlling traits of interest, search for loci undergoing selection, and contribute to genebank management by identifying taxonomic misassignments and duplicates. We conducted a genomic scan with genotyping by sequencing (GBS) derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 10,038 pepper (Capsicum spp.) accessions from worldwide genebanks and investigated the recent history of this iconic staple. Genomic data detected up to 1,618 duplicate accessions within and between genebanks and showed that taxonomic ambiguity and misclassification often involve interspecific hybrids that are difficult to classify morphologically. We deeply interrogated the genetic diversity of the commonly consumed Capsicum annuum to investigate its history, finding that the kinds of peppers collected in broad regions across the globe overlap considerably. The method ReMIXTURE-using genetic data to quantify the similarity between the complement of peppers from a focal region and those from other regions-was developed to supplement traditional population genetic analyses. The results reflect a vision of pepper as a highly desirable and tradable cultural commodity, spreading rapidly throughout the globe along major maritime and terrestrial trade routes. Marker associations and possible selective sweeps affecting traits such as pungency were observed, and these traits were shown to be distributed nonuniformly across the globe, suggesting that human preferences exerted a primary influence over domesticated pepper genetic structure.","Tripodi, Pasquale; Rabanus-Wallace, Mark Timothy; Barchi, Lorenzo; Kale, Sandip; Esposito, Salvatore; Acquadro, Alberto; Schafleitner, Roland; van Zonneveld, Maarten; Prohens, Jaime; Diez, Maria José; Börner, Andreas; Salinier, Jérémy; Caromel, Bernard; Bovy, Arnaud; Boyaci, Filiz; Pasev, Gancho; Brandt, Ronny; Himmelbach, Axel; Portis, Ezio; Finkers, Richard; Lanteri, Sergio; Paran, Ilan; Lefebvre, Véronique; Giuliano, Giovanni; Stein, Nils",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,602,1

Carboxymethyl chitosan capped gold nanoparticles (CMC-AuNPs) are used as plasmonic probes and are synthesized by a simple one pot wet chemical method. HR-TEM images show that the spherical structure of the CMC-AuNPs is changed into chain-like nanostructures after the addition of T7 virus due to the strong coordination of CMC-AuNPs with T7. Since T7 capsids comprise a repeating motif of capsomers built from proteins that bind to the acid groups of chitosan, the conjugation of carboxymethyl chitosan-linked AuNPs with T7 virions enables colorimetric biosensing detection. The absorbance intensity (∼610 nm) increases in the concentration range of T7 from 2 × 10(-15) M to 2 × 10(-13) M and the detection limit is found to be 2 × 10(-15) M (2 fM).

Amino acids are ubiquitous as dissolved nitrogenous organic matter in source water and can pass through drinking water treatment processes to react with disinfectants in finished water and in the distribution system. Phenylalanine (Phe) was selected as a model amino acid precursor to investigate its derived DBPs and their variations during a chlorination regime that simulated water distribution with residue chlorine. The 7-day DBPs formation potential (DBPsFP) test with chlorine revealed chlorination by-products of phenylalanine including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and halonitromethanes (HNMs), but not trichloronitromethane (TCNM) which was a significant N-DBP detected during the first 48 h of chlorine contact. The formation of most carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs) increased with chlorination time; however N-DBPs and non-chlorinated byproducts of phenylacetonitrile and phenylacetaldehyde reached their highest concentration after 2 h of reaction, and then gradually decreased until below detection after 7 days. The chlorination influencing factors indicated that light enhanced the peak yield of DBPs; the pH value showed different influences associated with corresponding DBPs; and the presence of bromide ions (Br-) generated a variety of bromine-containing DBPs. The DBPsFP test with chloramine reduced C-DBPs generation to about 1/3 of the level observed for chlorine disinfection and caused an increase in dichloroacetonitrile. Surveillance of DBPs during drinking water distribution to consumers should consider the varying contact times with disinfectants to accurately profile the types and concentrations of C-DBPs and N-DBPs present in drinking water.","Zhou, Kejin; Ye, Sheng; Yu, Qi; Chen, Jingji; Yong, Pang; Ma, Xiaoyan; Li, Qingsong; Dietrich, Andrea M",The Science of the total environment,602,29

Among them, genistein (Gen) stands out for showing cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cells. However, its low water solubility, limited bioavailability, and fast metabolism hinder its administration in chemopreventive therapies. To overcome these obstacles, bovine serum albumin nanovehicles (BSAnp) were obtained by a heat-induced self-assembly process at 70 °C and two aqueous medium pH (9.0 and 11.0) and assayed for the Gen loading. Thus, in this work, Gen loading in BSAnp was studied by spectroscopic techniques and compared with the one obtained for its stereoisomer, chrysin (Chrys). Results revealed that Gen binds to BSAnp via fluorescence quenching mechanism forming inclusion complexes. Compared to Chrys, Gen binding to BSAnp involved more molecules, whereas the association constant was similar for both flavonoids. In general, flavonoid loading in protein systems was strongly affected by the combined effects of BSA conformational state (native vs. aggregated), nanovehicle size, and flavonoid chemical structure. To evaluate the antitumor properties freeze-dried powders were obtained, and they were assayed in vitro after reconstitution by XTT technique and Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry against mouse mammary adenocarcinoma F3II cells. Gen-loaded BSAnp produced a significant decrease in cell viability compared with unloaded BSAnp systems, being the highest cytotoxic effects found for the lowest sized Gen-loaded BSAnp. The leading cytotoxicity mechanism for Gen-loaded systems was apoptosis. Summarizing, it can be concluded that BSAnp constitute versatile nanovehicles for potential flavonoid incorporation in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical matrices.","Ferrado, Joana B; Perez, Adrián A; Baravalle, María E; Renna, María Sol; Ortega, Hugo H; Santiago, Liliana G","Colloids and surfaces.

We decided to combine this access with the emerging laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) technique. We present our preliminary data on 11 renoureteral procedures and describe our retroperitoneoscopic LESS technique. As of March 2009, 10 patients were submitted to retroperitoneal LESS and divided into three groups: Group A, 3 patients underwent ureterolithotomy; Group B, 4 patients underwent renal cyst ablation; Group C, 4 patients underwent renal biopsy. Retroperitoneal access was obtained with an optical trocar. After retroperitoneal space blunt dissection, a multichannel port was placed. Standard and bent 5-mm instruments were used; we also used a 5-mm flexible laparoscope as a single procedure in group A. Ten of 11 procedures were completed without conversion; a single case in group A was converted to open surgery. Retroperitoneoscopic LESS is a safe and feasible procedure for renal biopsy and renal cyst ablation, with shorter convalescence time, less postoperative pain, and better cosmetic outcomes. LESS ureterolithotomy was more challenging for the lack of triangulation, resulting in a prolonged convalescence period. In addition, bent laparoscopic instruments are not suitable for retroperitoneal space; the multichannel port leaks carbon dioxide due to the flank position. Therefore LESS pelvic trainer practice is imperative in this case.","Micali, Salvatore; Isgrò, Gianmarco; De Stefani, Stefano; Pini, Giovannalberto; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara; Bianchi, Giampaolo",European urology,602,2

METHODS 182 infants aged <12 months hospitalised for bronchiolitis were enrolled. Infants underwent nasal washing for the detection of RSV, influenza virus A and B, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL-63, HUK1, adenovirus, RV, parainfluenza 1-3, human metapneumovirus and hBoV. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from parents and from patient medical files. Main outcome measurements were age, breastfeeding history, family smoking habits, family history for asthma and atopy, blood eosinophil count, chest radiological findings, clinical severity score and number of days of hospitalisation. RESULTS A virus was detected in 57.2% of the 182 infants. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV (41.2%), hBoV (12.2%) and RV (8.8%). Infants with dual infections (RSV and hBoV) had a higher clinical severity score and more days of hospitalisation than infants with RSV, RV and hBoV bronchiolitis (mean+/-SD: 4.7+2.4 vs 4.3+/-2.4 vs 3.0+/-2.0 vs 2.9+/-1.7, p<0.05; and 6.0+/-3.2 vs 5.3+/-2.4 vs 4.0+/-1.6 vs 3.9+/-1.1 days; p<0.05). Infants with RV infection had higher blood eosinophil counts than infants with bronchiolitis from RSV and hBoV (307+/-436 vs 138+/-168 vs 89+/-19 n/mm(3); p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although the major pathogen responsible for bronchiolitis remains RSV, the infection can also be caused by RV and hBoV.

Enzymologists use detailed structural insights on ligand coordination, interatomic distances and positioning of catalytic amino acids to rationalize the underlying electronic reaction mechanisms. Often the proteins in question catalyze redox reactions using metal cofactors that are explicitly intertwined with their function. In these cases, the exact nature of the coordination sphere and the oxidation state of the metal is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, the redox active nature of metal cofactors makes them especially susceptible to photoreduction, meaning that information obtained by photoreducing X-ray sources about the environment of the cofactor are the least trustworthy part of the structure. In this work we directly compare the kinetics of photoreduction of six different heme protein crystal species at by X-ray radiation. We show that a dose of approximately 40 kGy already yields 50% ferrous iron in a heme protein crystal. We also demonstrate that the kinetics of photoreduction are completely independent from variables unique to the different samples tested. The photoreduction-induced structural rearrangements around the metal cofactors have to be considered when biochemical data of ferric proteins are rationalized by constraints derived from crystal structures of reduced enzymes.","Pfanzagl, Vera; Beale, John H; Michlits, Hanna; Schmidt, Daniel; Gabler, Thomas; Obinger, Christian; Djinovic-Carugo, Kristina; Hofbauer, Stefan",The Journal of biological chemistry,602,1

METHODS To probe premotor-motor excitability, we used a transcranial magnetic stimulation dual pulse conditioning paradigm in 15 genetically confirmed dopa-responsive dystonia patients and 20 controls under different medication states. We also determined silent periods, short-latency afferent inhibition, interhemispheric inhibition, and short-interval intracortical inhibition and facilitation. RESULTS In contrast to healthy controls, no motor cortex inhibition was seen after premotor conditioning regardless of the dopaminergic state in patients. The duration of the ipsilateral silent period was increased in the OFF state, and short-latency afferent inhibition was reduced in the ON compared with the OFF state.

We reviewed our experience of encountering unexpected bleeding during thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS We defined ""unexpected intraoperative bleeding"" as the need for hemostatic procedures with angiorrhaphy, with or without a sealant. The location, cause, and management of injured vessels, and perioperative outcomes were investigated and compared with those for patients without injured vessels. RESULTS Between 2007 and 2014, a total of 241 thoracoscopic anatomical pulmonary resections were performed at our hospital. Twenty (8.3 %) of these patients required hemostatic procedures with angiorrhaphy, with or without a sealant. The main injured vessels were the pulmonary artery (n = 13) and vein (n = 3) and the main causes of injury were related to technical issues with energy devices and staplers. There were no morbidities related to intraoperative bleeding. The operation time and blood loss were significantly greater in the patients with vessel injury than in those without vessel injury, but perioperative morbidities and the duration of chest tube insertion (4.5 vs. 3.5 days, average, p = 0.20) and postoperative hospital stay (12.7 vs. 11.0 days, average, p = 0.08) were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of unexpected bleeding was relatively high in this series, but its management and outcomes were satisfactory in terms of safety.","Miyazaki, Takuro; Yamasaki, Naoya; Tsuchiya, Tomoshi; Matsumoto, Keitaro; Hatachi, Go; Kitamura, Yuka; Obata, Tomohiro; Doi, Ryoichiro; Machino, Ryusuke; Nagayasu, Takeshi",Surgery today,602,1

Objective To quantify how these lockdowns changed the spoken communication environments of children with cochlear implants by comparing the sounds they were exposed to before the Ontario provincial state of emergency in March 2020 and during the resulting closures of schools and nonessential businesses. Design, Setting, and Participants This experimental cohort study comprised children with hearing loss who used cochlear implants to hear. These children were chosen because (1) their devices monitor and catalog levels and types of sounds during hourly use per day (datalogs), and (2) this group is particularly vulnerable to reduced sound exposure. Children were recruited from the Cochlear Implant Program at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Ontario, Canada. Children whose cochlear implant datalogs were captured between February 1 and March 16, 2020, shortly before lockdown (pre-COVID-19), were identified. Repeated measures were collected in 45 children during initial easing of lockdown restrictions (stages 1-2 of the provincial recovery plan); resulting datalogs encompassed the lockdown period (peri-COVID-19). Main Outcomes and Measures Hours of sound captured by the Cochlear Nucleus datalogging system (Cochlear Corporation) in 6 categories of input levels (<40, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, ≥80 A-weighted dB sound pressure levels [dBA]) and 6 auditory scene categories (quiet, speech, speech-in-noise, music, noise, and other). Mixed-model regression analyses revealed main effects with post hoc adjustment of confidence intervals using the Satterthwaite method. Results A total of 45 children (mean [SD] age, 7.7 [5.0] years; 23 girls [51.1%]) participated in this cohort study. Results showed similar daily use of cochlear implants during the pre- and peri-COVID-19 periods (9.80 mean hours pre-COVID-19 and 9.34 mean hours peri-COVID-19). Despite consistent device use, these children experienced significant quieting of input sound levels peri-COVID-19 by 0.49 hour (95% CI, 0.21-0.80 hour) at 60 to 69 dBA and 1.70 hours (95% CI, 1.42-1.99 hours) at 70 to 79 dBA with clear reductions in speech exposure by 0.98 hour (95% CI, 0.49-1.47 hours). This outcome translated into a reduction of speech:quiet from 1.6:1.0 pre-COVID-19 to 0.9:1.0 during lockdowns. The greatest reductions in percentage of daily speech occurred in school-aged children (elementary, 12.32% [95% CI, 7.15%-17.49%]; middle school, 11.76% [95% CI, 5.00%-18.52%]; and high school, 9.60% [95% CI, 3.27%-15.93%]). Increased daily percentage of quiet (7.00% [95% CI, 4.27%-9.74%]) was most prevalent for children who had fewer numbers of people in their household (estimate [SE] = -1.12% [0.50%] per person; Cohen f = 0.31). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cohort study indicate a clear association of COVID-19 lockdowns with a reduction in children's access to spoken communication.","Gordon, Karen A; Daien, Maya F; Negandhi, Jaina; Blakeman, Alan; Ganek, Hillary; Papsin, Blake; Cushing, Sharon L",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,602,24

Supervised exercise training elicits clinically meaningful benefits in walking ability and quality of life. Walking is the modality of exercise with the strongest evidence and is recommended in several national and international guidelines. Alternate forms of exercise such as upper- or lower-body cycling may be used, if required by certain patients, although there is less evidence for these types of programmes. The evidence for progressive resistance training is growing and patients can also engage in strength-based training alongside a walking programme. For those unable to attend a supervised class (strongest evidence), home-based or 'self-facilitated' exercise programmes are known to improve walking distance when compared to simple advice. All exercise programmes, independent of the mode of delivery, should be progressive and individually prescribed where possible, considering disease severity, comorbidities and initial exercise capacity. All patients should aim to accumulate at least 30 min of aerobic activity, at least three times a week, for at least 3 months, ideally in the form of walking exercise to near-maximal claudication pain.","Harwood, Amy E; Pymer, Sean; Ingle, Lee; Doherty, Patrick; Chetter, Ian C; Parmenter, Belinda; Askew, Christopher D; Tew, Gary A",BMJ open sport & exercise medicine,602,29

This study aimed to elucidate the cytokines and chemokines inhibited by different treatments (conventional synthetic DMARD [csDMARD], biological and targeted synthetic DMARD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS Fifty-nine RA patients with low disease activity or remission included in a cross-sectional study were classified by treatment in groups: abatacept, certolizumab, rituximab (RTX), tocilizumab, tofacitinib (TOF), baricitinib (BAR), and csDMARD. Cytokine and chemokine serum levels were measured by LEGENDplex Human Inflammation panel. Quantitative variables were compared using Student t or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate, whereas qualitative variables were compared using χ or Fisher exact test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Certolizumab, RTX, tocilizumab, and TOF showed that most cytokine pathways inhibited: tumor necrosis factor α, interferon γ, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-12, IL-18, and IL-23; in addition, csDMARDs showed a similar inhibition patron except for IL-23. Serum level of tumor necrosis factor α pathway was one of the most inhibited being undetectable in RTX, TOF, and BAR groups. Interleukin 6 was shown to be inhibited by abatacept, RTX, and TOF; however, higher levels were observed in 3 patients treated with tocilizumab. Abatacept, certolizumab, RTX, and TOF downregulated IL-10 in this group of patients but remained detectable in almost half of the subjects, with the highest levels in the BAR group. The active pathways that remained the most were CC chemokine ligand 2, IL-8, IL-17, and IL-33. CONCLUSIONS Understanding the cytokine chemokine pathways inhibition could help rheumatologists to prescribe a tailored therapy using the arsenal of DMARDs for individualized RA treatment in an evidence-based decision manner.","Chavarria-Avila, Efrain; Vazquez-Del Mercado, Monica; Pizano-Martínez, Oscar; Roman-Lugo, German; Arrona-Rios, Karla; Perez-Vazquez, Felipe; De-La-Cruz, Jeniffer P; Calderon-Espinoza, Ivette; Aguilar-Vazquez, Andrea; Esesarte-Rodriguez, Marisol; Rubio-Arrellano, Edy D; Duran-Barragan, Sergio",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,602,1

We performed an umbrella review to clarify and determine the associations between tea consumption and various types of cancer by summarizing and recalculating the existing meta-analyses. Meta-analyses of observational studies reporting associations between tea consumption and cancer risk were searched on PubMed and Embase. Associations found to be statistically significant were further classified into levels of evidence (convincing, suggestive, or weak), based on P value, between-study heterogeneity, prediction intervals, and small study effects. Sixty-four observational studies (case-control or cohort) corresponding to 154 effect sizes on the incidence of 25 types of cancer were included. Forty-three (27.9%) results in 15 different types of cancer were statistically significant. When combining all studies on the same type of cancer, 19 results in 11 different types of cancer showed significant associations with lower risk of gastrointestinal tract organ cancer (oral, gastric, colorectal, biliary tract, and liver cancer), breast cancer, and gynecological cancer (endometrial and ovarian cancer) as well as leukemia, lung cancer, and thyroid cancer. Only the reduced risk of oral cancer in tea-consuming populations (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.72; P value < 10-6) was supported by convincing evidence. Suggestive evidence was found for 6 results on biliary tract, breast, endometrial, liver, and oral cancer. To summarize, tea consumption was shown to have protective effects on some types of cancer, particularly oral cancer. More well-designed prospective studies are needed with consideration of other factors that can cause biases.","Kim, Tai Lim; Jeong, Gwang Hun; Yang, Jae Won; Lee, Keum Hwa; Kronbichler, Andreas; van der Vliet, Hans J; Grosso, Giuseppe; Galvano, Fabio; Aune, Dagfinn; Kim, Jong Yeob; Veronese, Nicola; Stubbs, Brendon; Solmi, Marco; Koyanagi, Ai; Hong, Sung Hwi; Dragioti, Elena; Cho, Eunyoung; de Rezende, Leandro F M; Giovannucci, Edward L; Shin, Jae Il; Gamerith, Gabriele",Advances in nutrition,602,24

Limited qualitative research has investigated their experiences accessing psychosocial supportive care, and how it meets their needs. AIM To explore patients' perspectives of the role of psychosocial support in their experiences of living with advanced cancer. METHODS This study used an exploratory qualitative research design and drew upon a social constructionist interpretive framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants. Participants were asked about their experiences accessing and using psychosocial support following their diagnosis. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed using deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS The following six themes can be used to describe participants' experiences with psychosocial support: 1) accessing different types of support , 2) appreciating support, 3) need, 4) difficulties accessing support, 5) knowing about support, and 6) asking for support. Sources of psychosocial support included family and friends, health professionals, and psychosocial supportive care services. Not all participants were able to access care that met their needs; barriers included suitability of available support, accessibility, and stigma surrounding support use. CONCLUSION Participants experienced broad variation in their awareness and access to psychosocial support services to meet their needs. Providers of psychosocial supportive care for advanced cancer patients need to consider service accessibility issues. Future psychosocial interventions targeting people living with advanced cancer should consider these issues during development and implementation. This article is protected by copyright.

While they are the subject of ongoing investigation, surgery remains the definitive modality for oncological resection. Esophagectomy, however, is traditionally a challenging surgical procedure and carries a significant incidence of morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are considerably less invasive alternatives to esophagectomy in the diagnosis and treatment of high grade dysplasia, early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. However, many early esophageal cancer patients, with favorable histology, who could benefit from endoscopic resection, are referred for formal esophagectomy due to lesion characteristics such as unfavorable lesion morphology or recurrence after previous endoscopic resection. In this study we present a novel, hybrid thoracoscopic transgastric endoluminal segmental esophagectomy with primary anastomosis for the potential treatment of high grade dysplasia and early esophageal cancer in a porcine ex vivo model as a proposed bridge between endoscopic resection and the relatively high mortality and morbidity formal esophagectomy procedure. The novel technique consists of thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization in addition to transgastric endoluminal segmental esophagectomy and anastomosis utilizing a standard circular stapler. The technique was found feasible in all experimental subjects. The minimally invasive nature of this novel procedure as well as the utility of basic surgical equipment and surgical skill is an important attribute of this method and can potentially make it a treatment option for many patients who would otherwise be referred for a formal esophagectomy.","Kvasha, Anton; Khalifa, Muhammad; Biswas, Seema; Farraj, Moaad; Bramnik, Zakhar; Waksman, Igor",Frontiers in surgery,602,5

However, incomplete or delayed occlusion and persistent intracranial aneurysm growth are still an issue for up to one-third of the patients. We evaluated two patients with intracranial aneurysm located at the internal carotid artery who were treated with flow-diverting devices and had opposite outcomes. Both patients presented with similar aneurysms and were treated with the same device, but after a 1-year follow-up, one case presented with complete occlusion (Case 1) and the other required further treatment (Case 2). To reproduce the interventions, virtual stents were deployed and blood flow simulations were carried out using the respective patient-specific geometries. Afterward, hemodynamic metrics such as aneurysmal inflow reduction, wall shear stresses, oscillatory shear, and inflow concentration indices were quantified. The hemodynamic simulations reveal that for both cases, the neck inflow was clearly reduced due to the therapy (Case 1: 19%, Case 2: 35%). In addition, relevant hemodynamic parameters such as time-averaged wall shear stress (Case 1: 35.6%, Case 2: 57%) and oscillatory shear (Case 1: 33.1%, Case 2: 26.7%) were decreased considerably. However, although stronger relative reductions occurred in the unsuccessful case, the absolute flow values in the successful case were approximately halved. The findings demonstrate that a high relative effect of endovascular devices is not necessarily associated with the desired treatment outcome. Instead, it appears that a successful intracranial aneurysm therapy requires a certain patient-specific inflow threshold.","Berg, Philipp; Saalfeld, Sylvia; Janiga, Gábor; Brina, Olivier; Cancelliere, Nicole M; Machi, Paolo; Pereira, Vitor M",The International journal of artificial organs,602,19

Society has been facing this pandemic by following the recommendations and determinations of the WHO and the strategies deployed by governmental institutions. Among these, social isolation has been shown to be the most important, because when isolating, society tends to move less, with a consequent increase in physical inactivity and sedentary behavior, affecting its levels of physical fitness. The objectives of this review were: to review the most important effects of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior on the physical fitness levels of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND Despite advances in interventional techniques, treatment of calcified coronary lesions remains a challenge. Stent placement in these lesions may result in stent underexpansion, malapposition, and procedural complications. METHODS ORBIT II is a prospective, multicenter, nonblinded clinical trial that enrolled 443 consecutive patients with severely calcified coronary lesions at 49 U.S. sites from May 25, 2010, to November 26, 2012. Investigators used the centrifugal action of the OAS diamond-coated crown to modify calcified lesions prior to stent placement. RESULTS The pre-procedure mean minimal lumen diameter of 0.5 mm increased to 2.9 mm after the procedure. The primary safety endpoint was 89.6% freedom from 30-day major adverse cardiac events compared with the performance goal of 83%. The primary efficacy endpoint (residual stenosis <50% post-stent without in-hospital major adverse cardiac events) was 88.9% compared with the performance goal of 82%. Stent delivery occurred successfully in 97.7% of cases with <50% stenosis in 98.6% of subjects. Low rates of in-hospital Q-wave myocardial infarction (0.7%), cardiac death (0.2%), and target vessel revascularization (0.7%) were reported. CONCLUSIONS The ORBIT II coronary OAS trial met both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints by significant margins. Preparation of severely calcified plaque with the OAS not only helped facilitate stent delivery, but improved both acute and 30-day clinical outcomes compared with the outcomes of historic control subjects in this difficult-to-treat patient population.

Dosing optimisation requires a good knowledge of PK/PD principles. This review serves to provide a foundation in PK/PD principles for the commonly prescribed antibiotics (β-lactams, vancomycin, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides), as well as dosing considerations in special populations (critically ill and obese patients). PK principles determine whether an appropriate dose of antimicrobial reaches the intended pathogen(s). It involves the fundamental processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, and is affected by the antimicrobial's physicochemical properties. Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics define the relationship between the drug concentration and its observed effect on the pathogen. The major indicator of the effect of the antibiotics is the minimum inhibitory concentration. The quantitative relationship between a PK and microbiological parameter is known as a PK/PD index, which describes the relationship between dose administered and the rate and extent of bacterial killing. Improvements in clinical outcomes have been observed when antimicrobial agents are dosed optimally to achieve their respective PK/PD targets. With the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and a limited drug development pipeline, PK/PD concepts can foster more rational and individualised dosing regimens, improving outcomes while simultaneously limiting the toxicity of antimicrobials.","Hoo, Grace Si Ru; Liew, Yi Xin; Kwa, Andrea Lay-Hoon",Indian journal of medical microbiology,602,24

Currently, there is no evidence that pregnant women are more vulnerable to COVID-19. All concerns and anticipated risks are related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on perinatal outcomes, so pregnant women require special attention in relation to the preventive measures, diagnosis and treatment of a new coronavirus disease. Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) belong to the group of high perinatal risk and need timely medical assistance. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a necessity in temporary changes of approaches to diagnosing GSD and pregnancy care before and after delivery in women with GSD. The purpose of our review is to present and analyze all available GSD screening recommendations, updated and published in various countries in response to the coronavirus pandemic, at the time of publication of this article. It seems that there is no single universal strategy to achieve a reasonable balance. In this regard, it is necessary to develop new national algorithms for GSD screening, taking into account both demographic factors and the features and capabilities of our health system.

At the time of writing, the death toll was greater than 120 000 worldwide with more than 2 million documented infections. The genome of the CoV encodes a number of structural proteins that facilitate cellular entry and assembly of virions, of which the spike protein S appears to be critical for cellular entry. The spike protein guides the virus to attach to the host cell. The spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fusion domain and a transmembrane domain. The RBD of spike protein S binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate cellular entry. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 90% amino acid similarity to the pangolin and bat CoVs and these also use ACE2 as a receptor. Binding of the spike protein to ACE2 exposes the cleavage sites to cellular proteases. Cleavage of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 and other cellular proteases initiates fusion and endocytosis. The spike protein contains an addition furin cleavage site that may allow it to be 'preactivated' and highly infectious after replication. The fundamental role of the spike protein in infectivity suggests that it is an important target for vaccine development, blocking therapy with antibodies and diagnostic antigen-based tests. This review briefly outlines the structure and function of the 2019 novel CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S.","Pillay, Tahir S",Journal of clinical pathology,602,15

Nonetheless, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of GZFLC remain unclear. The integration of computational and experimental methods of network pharmacology might be a promising way to decipher the mechanisms. In this study, the target profiles of 51 representative compounds of GZFLC were first predicted by a high-accuracy algorithm, drugCIPHER-CS, and the network target of GZFLC was identified. Then, potential functional modules of GZFLC on primary dysmenorrhea were investigated using functional enrichment analysis. Potential bioactive compounds were recognized by hierarchical clustering analysis of GZFLC compounds and first-line anti-dysmenorrhea drugs. Furthermore, the potential anti-dysmenorrhea mechanisms of GZFLC were verified through enzyme activity assays and immunofluorescence tests. Moreover, effects of GZFLC on primary dysmenorrhea were evaluated in oxytocin-induced dysmenorrhea murine model. In the network target analysis, GZFLC may act on five functional modules of pain, inflammation, endocrine, blood circulation and energy metabolism. Integrating computational and experimental approaches, we found that GZFLC significantly inhibited the writhing response and reduced the degree of uterine lesions in oxytocin-induced dysmenorrhea murine model. Furthermore, GZFLC may partially alleviate primary dysmenorrhea by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and downregulating MAPK signaling pathway. Consequently, GZFLC presented pain relief and sustained benefits for primary dysmenorrhea. This study could provide a scientific approach for deciphering pharmacological mechanisms of herbal formulae through network pharmacology.","Zhang, Siqin; Lai, Xinxing; Wang, Xin; Liu, Gang; Wang, Zhenzhong; Cao, Liang; Zhang, Xinzhuang; Xiao, Wei; Li, Shao",Frontiers in pharmacology,602,5

The currently most widely used device for MBM is the Duette device. Recently, the Captivator EMR device has come available which might have practical advantages over the Duette device. METHODS Phase I was a randomized pre-esophagectomy trial with a non-inferiority design aiming to compare EMR specimens obtained with the Captivator and the Duette device. PRIMARY OUTCOME max diameter of the EMR specimens, secondary outcomes: min diameter, max thickness of the EMR specimens and resected submucosal stroma. Phase II were clinical pilot cases aiming to evaluate the feasibility of EMR using the Captivator device. Primary outcome was the successful EMR rate and secondary outcomes included procedure time and adverse events. RESULTS Phase I: 24 EMR specimens (12 pairs) were obtained from six patients. The median max diameter of EMR specimens obtained with the Captivator device was 16 mm [IQR 12-21] versus 18 mm [IQR 13-23] for the Duette device. Non-inferiority of the max diameter of the Captivator specimens could not be demonstrated (median difference 1 mm, 95% CI - 3.26 to + 5.26). However, when using paired analysis, no significant difference was found (p 0.573). In addition, no statistically significant differences were found in the min diameter, max thickness of EMR specimens, and max thickness of resected submucosal stroma. Phase II: 5 BE patients with early neoplastic lesions were included. Successful EMR was achieved in 100%. Median procedure time was 33 min (IQR 25-39). One patient developed transient dysphagia, without signs of stenosis on endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS EMR of early Barrett's neoplasia using the Captivator device is comparable to Duette EMR when looking at size of resected specimens. In the first patients, EMR using the Captivator was feasible, resulting in successful resection without acute adverse events.","Belghazi, K; Schölvinck, D W; van Berge Henegouwen, M I; Gisbertz, S S; Weusten, B L; Meijer, S L; Bergman, J J; Pouw, R E",Surgical endoscopy,602,17

Caring for persons with dementia is a challenge and often leads to negative psychological, physiological and financial consequences for informal carers (family members or friends). Many informal carers experience moderate to severe levels of burden. Advances in technology have the potential to assist persons with dementia and their carers, through assistive technology (AT) devices such as electronic medication dispensers, robotic devices and motion detectors. However, little is known about informal carers' experience and the impact of these technologies on them. This review aims to investigate the outcomes and experience of carers of persons with dementia, who live at home and use AT. METHOD MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, ALOIS, PsycINFO, Trial registries and OpenGrey databases will be searched for studies of any design that have investigated carer experience and/or outcomes of AT use for persons with dementia living at home. Manual searches from reference lists of relevant papers will also be undertaken. Outcomes of interest are carers' self-reported outcomes (which include perceived burden, quality of life and wellbeing) and carer experiences (such as usefulness, benefits and disadvantages of AT and impact on caregiver/care receiver relationship). Two independent reviewers will screen identified papers with pre-defined eligibility criteria and extract data using a bespoke extraction form. Discrepancies will be resolved in discussion with a third reviewer. A synthesis of eligible studies and summary will be provided. DISCUSSION A systematic review of quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods evidence of informal carers' experience of AT use in dementia in the community will be carried out. It is anticipated that this will highlight (1) investigations on impact of AT use on carers, (2) outcome measures and experience questionnaires that have been used and (3) the types of studies carried out so far on this topic. The results from the review will be presented in a summary matrix of common types (e.g. mobile phones, alarms) and uses (e.g. communication, safety, personal care) of AT in dementia care and also identify AT that is not usually available through government or health system funding.

The techniques for laparoscopic appendectomy are widely described in surgical textbooks, but the vascular control of the appendicular artery is diverse. In this article, we compare the benefits and possible complications of different techniques to obtain vascular control. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data including all cases of laparoscopic appendectomy from September 1990 to August 2009. Here we describe the different methods used, and we present a large series of 729 cases of laparoscopic appendectomy. In the majority of the cases the diagnosis was acute appendicitis followed by laparoscopic appendectomy. In only 124 cases was an incidental appendectomy performed associated with another laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS In 350 cases (48%) monopolar cauterization was used to obtain vascular control of the appendicular artery. In the other 379 cases the artery was either clipped or stapled (52%). There were no postoperative complications reported. There was no difference in patient outcome with either approach to obtain adequate vascular control. CONCLUSIONS The vascular control of the appendicular artery obtained with monopolar cautery is a safe, fast, and economic approach easily done during a laparoscopic or needlescopic appendectomy with no increased risks or complications.","Davila, Daniel; Russek, Karla; Franklin, Morris E",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In women, changes in the concentrations of reproductive hormones across menstrual phases may affect pain, as well as the regulation of body water. This indicates potential interactions between the menstrual phase and hypohydration on pain, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested. This review examined the literature concerning the effects of the menstrual phase and hypohydration on pain, to explore how these factors may interact to influence pain.

An accurate and validated transmission model for T. solium would serve as an important new tool for control and elimination, as it would allow for comparison of available intervention strategies, and prioritization of the most effective strategies for control and elimination efforts. METHODS We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model (ABM) for T. solium (""CystiAgent"") that differs from prior T. solium models by including a spatial framework and behavioral parameters such as pig roaming, open human defecation, and human travel. In this article, we introduce the structure and function of the model, describe the data sources used to parameterize the model, and apply sensitivity analyses (Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC)) to evaluate model parameters. RESULTS LHS-PRCC analysis of CystiAgent found that the parameters with the greatest impact on model uncertainty were the roaming range of pigs, the infectious duration of human taeniasis, use of latrines, and the set of ""tuning"" parameters defining the probabilities of infection in humans and pigs given exposure to T. solium. CONCLUSIONS CystiAgent is a novel ABM that has the ability to model spatial and behavioral features of T. solium transmission not available in other models. There is a small set of impactful model parameters that contribute uncertainty to the model and may impact the accuracy of model projections. Field and laboratory studies to better understand these key components of transmission may help reduce uncertainty, while current applications of CystiAgent may consider calibration of these parameters to improve model performance. These results will ultimately allow for improved interpretation of model validation results, and usage of the model to compare available control and elimination strategies for T. solium.","Pray, Ian W; Wakeland, Wayne; Pan, William; Lambert, William E; Garcia, Hector H; Gonzalez, Armando E; O'Neal, Seth E",Parasites & vectors,602,8

RFA is effective for small (<3 cm) tumors, but for tumors > 3 cm, there is a tendency to leave viable tumor cells in the margins or clefts of overlapping ablation zones. This increases the possibility of incomplete ablation or local recurrence. Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD), is a thermally sensitive liposomal doxorubicin formulation for intravenous administration, that rapidly releases its drug content when exposed to temperatures >40°C. When used with RFA, LTLD releases its doxorubicin in the vasculature around the zone of ablation-induced tumor cell necrosis, killing micrometastases in the ablation margin. This may reduce recurrence and be more effective than thermal ablation alone. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to optimize the RFA procedure used in combination with LTLD to maximize the local deposition of doxorubicin in a swine liver model. Pigs were anaesthetized and the liver was surgically exposed. Each pig received a single, 50 mg/m2 dose of the clinical LTLD formulation (ThermoDox®). Subsequently, ablations were performed with either 1, 3 or 6 sequential, overlapping needle insertions in the left medial lobe with total ablation time of 15, 45 or 90 minutes respectively. Two different RFA generators and probes were evaluated. After the final ablation, the ablation zone (plus 3 cm margin) was dissected out and examined for doxorubicin concentration by LC/MS and fluorescence. CONCLUSION The mean Cmax of plasma total doxorubicin was 26.5 μg/ml at the end of the infusion. Overall, increased heat time from 15 to 45 to 90 minutes shows an increase in both the amount of doxorubicin deposited (up to ~100 μg/g) and the width of the ablation target margin to which doxorubicin is delivered as determined by tissue homogenization and LC/MS detection of doxorubicin and by fluorescent imaging of tissues.","Swenson, Christine E; Haemmerich, Dieter; Maul, Donald H; Knox, Bridget; Ehrhart, Nicole; Reed, Robert A",PloS one,602,24

A rapid review of recently published literature.,17.963398,6.271074,2020-04-28,"Nutraceutical treatments can reduce inflammation and prevent the development of inflammatory diseases. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of Smilax guianensis Vitman extract (SGE) were examined. SGE suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated nitrite production in RAW 264.7 cells. SGE also prevented the LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) but not cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Western blot analysis showed that SGE attenuated LPS-induced phosphorylation of IκB kinase, inhibitor of kappa B (IκB), and p65. Additionally, SGE inhibited LPS-induced IκB degradation in RAW 264.7 cells. Western blot analysis of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as well as immunofluorescence assay results, revealed that SGE suppressed LPS-induced p65 nuclear translocation in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, SGE reduced LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression and IL-1β and IL-6 protein expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that SGE suppresses the NF-κB signaling pathway and thereby inhibits the production of NO, IL-1β, and IL-6.","Kim, Ju Gyeong; Kim, Min Jeong; Lee, Ji Su; Sydara, Kongmany; Lee, Sangwoo; Byun, Sanguine; Jung, Sung Keun",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,602,22

PATIENTS AND METHODS The annual number of surgical procedures for the management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) by procedure type and age group for the years 2008/09-2017/18 was obtained from the Australian Government Department of Human Services (DHS) database using Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item numbers. The data extracted was limited to females, 25 years and older. These data were used to calculate age-specific and age-standardised rates, so as to accurately analyze trends in the usage of different procedures. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for mid-urethral sling (MUS) insertions were obtained for England's National Health Service (NHS) from the Health and Social Care Information Centre for the years 2008/09-2016/17. These data were also used to calculate annual age-standardised rates for comparative purposes. RESULTS Rates declined for most SUI procedures over time (Mid urethral slings (MUS), colposuspension, fascial slings) except for urethral bulking agents. The absolute number of MUS implanted in 2008/9 was 5729, which decreased to 3127 in the 2017/18 financial year. Over the decade the annual rate for MUS implantation per 100,000 population halved from 78 to 36. Over this same period, the rate of usage of bulking agents doubled, although represented a low volume of procedures (overall numbers increased from 304 to 698 representing an increase from 4 to 8 procedures per 100,000 population). The age-specific peak rate for MUS and Burch colposuspension changed over the decade from 55-64 years to 65-74 years suggesting that women are deferring surgical treatment until later in life. Over the last decade the total number of surgical procedures performed in Australia to treat SUI has decreased markedly from 6812 to 4279. This represents a decrease in the annual rate per 100,000 population from 93 to 49. CONCLUSIONS There are clear changes evident for SUI management in the past decade in Australia, including an overall decline in operative numbers, which correlate with international advisory notifications and local investigations. The results of the Australian Senate inquiry, including removal of single-incision mini-slings, greater availability of patient resources, and greater regulation of SUI procedures will likely have ongoing effects. Surgeons need to ensure sufficient training and patient education continue in order to maintain appropriate access for treatment of SUI in the future.","Mathieson, Rebecca; Kippen, Rebecca; Manning, Todd; Brennan, Janelle",BJU international,602,1

Despite exercise therapy being the mainstay of tendinopathy management, there are many potential adjunct therapies that remain under investigated, one of which is photobiomodulation (PBM). PBM uses varied wavelengths of light to create a biological effect. While PBM is used frequently in the management of tendinopathy, high quality evidence supporting its utility is lacking. METHODS A systematic search of the Pubmed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database, Web of Science and SPORTSDICUS databases was performed for eligible articles in August 2020. Randomized Control Trials that used red or near-infrared PBM to treat tendinopathy disorders that made comparisons with a sham or 'other' intervention were included. Pain and function data were extracted from the included studies. The data were synthesized using a random effects model. The meta-analysis was performed using the mean difference (MD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) statistics. RESULTS A total of 17 trials were included (n = 835). When compared solely to other interventions PBM resulted in similar decreases in pain (MD -0.09; 95% CI - 0.79 to 0.61) and a smaller improvement in function (SMD -0.52; 95% CI - 0.81 to - 0.23). When PBM plus exercise was compared to sham treatment plus exercise, PBM demonstrated greater decreases in pain (MD 1.06; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.55) and improved function (MD 5.65; 95% CI 0.25 to 11.04). When PBM plus exercise was compared to other interventions plus exercise, no differences were noted in pain levels (MD 0.31; 95% CI - 0.07 to 0.70). Most studies were judged as low-risk of bias. The outcome measures were classified as very low to moderate evidence quality according to the Grading of Recommendation, Development and Evaluation tool. CONCLUSION There is very-low-to-moderate quality evidence demonstrating that PBM has utility as a standalone and/or adjunctive therapy for tendinopathy disorders.

The discovery of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), most notably toll-like receptors (TLRs), in innate immunity has evoked increased interest in the therapeutic handling of the innate immune system. TLRs are germ line-encoded receptors that play a potent role in the recognition of a diverse variety of ligands ranging from hydrophilic nucleic acids to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycan (PGN) structures in pathogens. AREAS COVERED This review discusses recent updates (2006-2010) in completed, ongoing and planned clinical trials of TLR immunomodulator-based therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer. EXPERT OPINION Since the discovery of human TLRs, modulating immune responses using TLR agonists or antagonists for therapeutic purposes has provoked intense activity in the pharmaceutical industry. The ability of TLRs to initiate and propagate inflammation makes them attractive therapeutic targets. We are now at the stage of evaluating such molecules in human diseases. Additionally, there is also extensive literature available on TLRs in diseased states. These data provide a basis for the identification of novel immunomodulators (agonists and antagonists) for the therapeutic targeting of TLRs.","Basith, Shaherin; Manavalan, Balachandran; Lee, Gwang; Kim, Sang Geon; Choi, Sangdun",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,602,1

Whether this has been associated with delayed reperfusion and worse outcomes in French patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unknown. AIM To compare the rate of STEMI admissions, treatment delays, and outcomes between the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and the equivalent period in 2019. METHODS In this nationwide French survey, data from consecutive STEMI patients from 65 centres referred for urgent revascularization between 1 March and 31 May 2020, and between 1 March and 31 May 2019, were analysed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death or non-fatal mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS A total of 6306 patients were included. During the pandemic peak, a 13.9±6.6% (P=0.003) decrease in STEMI admissions per week was observed. Delays between symptom onset and percutaneous coronary intervention were longer in 2020 versus 2019 (270 [interquartile range 150-705] vs 245 [140-646]min; P=0.013), driven by the increase in time from symptom onset to first medical contact (121 [60-360] vs 150 [62-420]min; P=0.002). During 2020, a greater number of mechanical complications was observed (0.9% vs 1.7%; P=0.029) leading to a significant difference in the primary outcome (112 patients [5.6%] in 2019 vs 129 [7.6%] in 2020; P=0.018). No significant difference was observed in rates of orotracheal intubation, in-hospital cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, there was a decrease in STEMI admissions, associated with longer ischaemic time, exclusively driven by an increase in patient-related delays and an increase in mechanical complications. These findings suggest the need to encourage the population to seek medical help in case of symptoms.","Bonnet, Guillaume; Panagides, Vassili; Becker, Mathieu; Rivière, Nicolas; Yvorel, Cédric; Deney, Antoine; Lattuca, Benoit; Duband, Benjamin; Moussa, Karim; Juenin, Léa; Pamart, Thibault; Semaan, Carl; Uhry, Sabrina; Noirclerc, Nathalie; Vincent, Flavien; Vignac, Maxime; Palermo, Vincenzo; Martin, Anne Sophie; Zeitouni, Michel; Van Belle, Eric; Tirouvanziam, Ashok; Manchuelle, Aurélie; Chamandi, Chekrallah; Kerneis, Mathieu; Boukantar, Madjid; Belle, Loïc; De Poli, Fabien; Angoulvant, Denis; Meneveau, Nicolas; Robin, Marie; Pansieri, Michel; Bonello, Laurent; Motreff, Pascal; Bouisset, Frédéric; Isaaz, Karl; Cetran, Laura; Khalife, Khalifé; Lesizza, Pierluigi; Adjedj, Julien; Benamer, Hakim; Cayla, Guillaume",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,602,28

The resistance of pathogenic bacteria and deaths attributable to bacterial infections is increasing exponentially. Bacteria used different mechanisms to counterattack to existing antibiotics namely (i) enzymatic inhibition, (ii) penicillin binding protein modification, (iii) porin mutations, (iv) efflux pumps and (v) molecular modifications of antibiotic targets. Developing new antibiotics would be time consuming to address such situation, thus one of the promising approaches is by potentiating existing antibiotics. Plants used synergism to naturally defend and protect themselves from microbes. Using the same strategy, several studies have shown that the combinations of natural products and antibiotics could effectively prolong the lifespan of existing antibiotics and minimize the impact and emergence of antibiotic resistance. Combining essential oils constituents namely uvaol, ferruginol, farnesol, carvacrol, with antibiotics have proved to be efficient efflux pump inhibitors. Plant-derived compounds such as gallic acid and tannic acid are effective potentiators of various antibiotics including novobiocin, chlorobiocin, coumermycin, fusidic acid, and rifampicin, resulting in a 4-fold increase in the potencies of these antibiotics. Several lines of research, as discussed in this review, have demonstrated the effectiveness of natural products in potentiating existing antibiotics. For this reason, the search for more efficient combinations should be an ongoing process with the aim to extend the life of the ones that we have and maybe preserve the life for the ones that is yet to come.","Mahomoodally, Mohamad Fawzi; Sadeer, Nabeelah Bibi",Current drug targets,602,1

However, the functional role of FXR in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the precise molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that FXR expression was downregulated in colon cancer tissues and decreased expression of FXR predicted a poor prognosis. Knockdown of FXR promoted colon cancer cell growth and invasion in vitro, and facilitated xenograft tumor formation and distant metastasis in vivo, whereas ectopic expression of FXR had the reserved change. Mechanistic studies indicated that FXR exerted its tumor suppressor functions by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, we identified an FXR/β-catenin interaction in colon cancer cells. The FXR/β-catenin interaction impaired β-catenin/TCF4 complex formation. In addition, our study suggested a reciprocal relationship between FXR and β-catenin, since loss of β-catenin increased the transcriptional activation of SHP by FXR. Altogether, these data indicated that FXR functions a tumor-suppressor role in CRC by antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling.","Yu, Junhui; Li, Shan; Guo, Jing; Xu, Zhengshui; Zheng, Jianbao; Sun, Xuejun",Cell death & disease,602,7

METHODS we reviewed the data coming from 48 Covid-19 patients whose nasopharyngeal swabs have turned negative, all employed at our facility, that opted in for a free screening of audiovestibular symptoms offered by our hospital after the aforementioned report was published. The screening included a tonal pure tone audiometry, a vHIT and SHIMP test, as well as a survey including known symptoms and audiovestibular symptoms. RESULTS general symptoms as reported by our patients largely reflect what reported by others in the literature. 4 (8.3%) patients reported hearing loss, 2 (4.2%) tinnitus, 4 dizziness (8.3%), 1 spinning vertigo (2%), 1 dynamic imbalance (2%), 3 static imbalance (6.3%). Most audiovestibular symptoms have regressed. Thresholds at pure tone audiometry and vHIT gain were within normality range in all post-Covid-19 patients.

A survey by the RNID showed that 77% of BSL users had difficulty communicating with hospital staff, and 33% left consultations with their family doctor unsure about instructions or taking incorrect medication doses.10 30% avoided seeing their family doctors because of communication difficulties.10 It is important to note that from August 2016, the Accessible Information Standard introduced a legal requirement in England for NHS organisations to ask for, record and meet communication needs.11 Clinical case A recent trauma on-call shift saw the admission of a 95-yearold male who had fallen and broken his hip. A study by Reeves in 2002 found that BSL interpreters were present at just 17% of GP and 7% of ED consultations, despite over half of the sample expressing desired support from these services.17 An interpreter had not been engaged for 42% of scheduled GP appointments where it would have been useful and 57% of A&E attendees would have found it useful for the doctor or nurse to know BSL, or for there be a 24-hour interpreter service.17 The 2018 Good Practice Report by the RNID echoes this, with 64% of patients leaving GP consultations feeling unclear at least some of the time.18 The reality is that while interpreting services are generally available, either in person or virtually, staff are often unaware of how to access them. Doctor-patient interactions in general practice or the hospital setting are often under time constraints outside the clinician's control and interpreters often need advance notice, with technological barriers to virtual consultations requiring specific apps and planning.17 The confounding factor of cognitive state Hearing loss has been shown to be independently associated with delirium in the ED.19 Patients are concomitantly often affected by chronic cognitive conditions such","Abou-Abdallah, Michel Lamyman Abigail",Clinical Medicine,602,1

However, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) provides significant improvements in accessibility, turnaround time and portability. Characteristics that gives developing countries the opportunity to perform genome surveillance. The most used protocol to sequence SARS-CoV-2 with ONT is an amplicon-sequencing protocol provided by the ARTIC Network which requires DNA ligation. Ligation reagents can be difficult to obtain in countries like Bolivia. Thus, here we provide an alternative for library preparation using the rapid PCR barcoding kit (ONT). We mapped more than 3.9 million sequence reads that allowed us to sequence twelve SARS-CoV-2 genomes from three different Bolivian cities. The average sequencing depth was 324X and the average genome length was 29527 bp. Thus, we could cover in average a 98,7% of the reference genome. The twelve genomes were successfully assigned to four different nextstrain clades (20A, 20B, 20E and 20G) and we could observe two main lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Bolivia. Therefore, this alternative library preparation for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is effective to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants with high accuracy and without the need of DNA ligation. Hence, providing another tool to perform SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance in developing countries.","Rollano-Peñaloza, Oscar M.; Barrera, Carmen Delgado; Michel, Aneth Vasquez",bioRxiv,602,16

While DNA methylation signatures have been extensively employed in recent years as an alternative to flow cytometry to define cell populations in peripheral blood, this approach has not been tested in lung-derived samples. Here, we compared bronchoalveolar lavage with a more cost-effective and less invasive technique based on sputum induction and developed a DNA methylome-based algorithm that can be used to deconvolute the cell types in such samples. Results We analyzed the DNA methylome profiles of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes cells isolated from the pulmonary compartment. The cells were isolated using two different methods, sputum induction and bronchoalveolar lavage. A strong positive correlation between the DNA methylome profiles of cells obtained with the two isolation methods was observed, and in two of the donors, in which the correlation was best, a later analyses demonstrated that those subjects the samples were consistently derived from the lower part of the lungs. We also identified unique patterns of CpG methylation in DNA obtained from the two cell populations, which can be used as a signature to discriminate between the alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes by means of open-source algorithms. We validated our findings with external data and obtained results consistent with the previous findings. Conclusions Our analysis opens up a new possibility to identify different cell populations from lung samples and promotes sputum induction as a tool to study immune cell populations from the lung.","Das, Jyotirmoy; Idh, Nina; Sikkeland, Liv Ingunn Bjoner; Paues, Jakob; Lerm, Maria",bioRxiv,602,16

Therefore, the way we manage our food systems needs to be urgently changed if the goal is to achieve food security and sustainable development more quickly. This review paper analyzes the nexus “climate-smart agriculture-food systems-sustainable development” in order to draw sound ways that could allow rapid transformation of food systems in the context of climate change pressure. We followed an integrative review approach based on selected concrete example-experiences from ground-implemented projects across Africa (Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, in West Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania in East Africa). Mostly composed of examples from the Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) Research Program of the CGIAR (former Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research) and its partners, these also included ground initiatives from non-CGIAR that could provide demonstrable conditions for a transformative agriculture and food systems. The lessons learnt from the ground implementation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA), in the African context, were instrumental to informing the actions areas of the food-system transformation framework suggested in this paper (reroute, de-risk, reduce, and realign). Selected CSA example-cases to inform these action areas included 24 initiatives across Africa, but with a focus on the following studies for an in-depth analysis: (1) the climate-smart village approach to generate knowledge on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies and practices for their scaling, (2) the use of climate information services (CIS) to better manage climate variability and extremes, and (3) the science–policy interfacing to mainstream CSA into agricultural development policies and plans. The analysis of these examples showed that CSA can contribute driving a rapid change of food systems in Africa through: (1) the implementation of relevant climate-smart technologies and practices to reroute farming and rural livelihoods to new climate-resilient and low-emission trajectories;(2) the development and application of weather and climate information services (WCIS) that support de-risking of livelihoods, farms, and value chains in the face of increasing vagaries of weather and extreme events;(3) the use of climate-smart options that minimize waste of all the natural resources used for growing, processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing food, and therefore mitigating the carbon footprint attached to this food loss and waste;and (4) the realignment of policies and finance that facilitate action in the four proposed action areas through the identification of news ways to mobilize sustainable finance and create innovative financial mechanisms and delivery channels.","Zougmoré, Robert B.; Läderach, Peter Campbell Bruce M.",Sustainability,602,1

In this study we examined how socio-demographic and population health characteristics shape the geospatial variability in excess mortality patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Methods: Weekly all-cause mortality time series for all 32 Mexican states, from January 4, 2015 to April 10, 2021, were analyzed to estimate the excess mortality rates using Serfling regression models. The association between socio-demographic, health indicators and excess mortality rates were determined using multiple linear regression analyses. Finally, we used functional data analysis to characterize clusters of states with distinct mortality growth rate curves. Results: The overall all-cause excess deaths rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico until April 10, 2021 was estimated at 39.66 per 10 000 population. The lowest excess death rates were observed in southeastern states including Chiapas (12.72), Oaxaca (13.42) and Quintana Roo (19.41) whereas Mexico City had the highest excess death rate (106.17), followed by Tlaxcala (51.99) and Morelos (45.90). We found a positive association of excess mortality rates with aging index (P value<.0001), marginalization index (P value<.0001), and average household size (P value=0.0003) in the final adjusted model (Model R2=76%). We identified four distinct clusters with qualitatively similar excess mortality curves. Conclusion: Central states exhibited the highest excess mortality rates whereas the distribution of aging index, marginalization index, and average household size explained the variability in excess mortality rates across Mexico. Our findings can help tailor interventions to mitigate the mortality impact of the pandemic.","Dahal, S.; Luo, R.; Swahn, M. H.; Chowell, G.",,602,20

Design/methodology/approach The study used the extended values, beliefs, and norms (VBN) theory to examine the relationship between human service attributes and customers' revisit intention. We analyzed the causal relationships between the human service attributes of “trust,” “friendship,” and “customization,” and customers' perceived values, beliefs, norms, and revisit intention. In addition, multi-group analysis was performed according to the restaurants’ menu types. An online survey was conducted in January 2021 with adults aged 18 years or older who visited restaurants that provide human services within the past six months. The final sample included 314 participants. Findings The human service attributes of “friendship” and “customization” had a positive effect on the perceived value, and the “perceived value” had a positive effect on beliefs. “Beliefs” and “social norms” had positive effects on personal norms, whereas “personal norms” and “social norms” had positive effects on revisit intention. Additionally, restaurants’ menu types had a partially moderating effect.

Such a global mental health crisis requires identification of key mechanisms which contribute to distress during pandemic. Specificity of COVID-19 outbreak was lack of sufficient information at the beginning and, consequently, a high level of perceived uncertainty. The main aim of this study was to examine the influence of the intolerance of uncertainty to the experienced level of distress during the pandemic. Additionally, influence of media exposure and fear were examined. Total of 740 participants took part in an online study during the coronavirus outbreak in Serbia. Moderately high level of distress was recorded in our sample. About 1/3 of participants were in each group: no distress, moderately high and highly elevated. Results of serial mediation analysis showed that the intolerance of uncertainty had a significant direct effect on distress, but also indirect via fear of COVID-19 and media exposure. Higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty lead to more time spent on media looking for information, and consequently to higher fear and distress levels. Furthermore, it was shown that media exposure also increased the level of fear. Such results emphasized the importance of unambiguous, clear informing during the time of crisis which can decrease uncertainty, and provided some practical implication for media and authorities. © 2020 Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi Sad, Serbia.

One of the important ways to counteract the rumors in online social networks (OSNs) is to spread counter-rumors. In this work, we propose a Precedence based Competitive Cascade (PCC) model for the propagation of competing rumor and counter-rumor cascades. We have presented a model to compute a belief based precedence value by which a user chooses to believe the rumor or counter-rumor received during information propagation. The influence of the rumor and the counter-rumor cascades in the OSNs is analyzed by considering a neighborhood based propagation approach. Another challenging issue which has been addressed in this work is to select the minimal seed set of users for the initiation of the counter-rumor so as to reduce the message overhead in the application. This has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to select the minimal set of seed users for counter-rumor to minimize the effect of the rumor. We design a Decomposition based Multi-objective Genetic (DMOG) algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments are conducted on real-world data sets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed PCC model and DMOG algorithm by considering important parameters such as the precedence, budget and time delay.","Parimi, Priyanka Rout Rashmi Ranjan",Information Processing &amp; Management,602,16

The efficacy of various medication strategies at the behest of public health authorities are investigated. Without treatment, the median lethal dose - not previously considered in humans - is estimated at approximately 1,000 organisms. Results suggest that fatality can be averted if antibiotics are administered for at least 7 days, no later than 10 days post exposure. In a mass casualty setting, this can reduce symptomatic cases by 18% from the baseline involving no medication. Reductions of 59% are possible if medication can be disseminated no later than 5 days post exposure, mitigating otherwise severe pressure on healthcare services.

It affects public safety and well-being. A crucial step in the COVID-19 battle will be tracking the positive cases with convenient accuracy of diagnosis. However, the time of pandemics shows the emergent need for automated diagnosis to support medical staff decisions in different steps of diagnosis and prognosis of target disease like medical imaging through X-rays, CT-Scans, etc. Besides laboratory investigation steps, we propose a system that provides an automated multi-stage decision system supported with decision causes using deep learning techniques for tracking cases of a target disease (COVID-19 in our paper). Encouraged by the open-source Data sets for COVID-19 infected patients' chest radiology, we proposed a system of three Consecutive stages. Each stage consists of a deep learning binary classifier tailored for the detection of a specific COVID-19 infection feature from chest radiology, either X-ray or CT-scan. By integrating the three classifiers, a multi-stage diagnostic system was attained that achieves an accuracy of (87.980 %), (78.717%), and (84%) for the three stages, respectively. By no means a productionready solution, our system will help in reducing errors caused by human decisions, taken under pressure, and exhausting routines, and it will be reliable to take urgent decisions once the model performance achieves the needed accuracy.","Gomaa, M.

The severe competition over high-speed rail (HSR) by two countries, joined by French and German competitors, has been intensified for the benefit of China, taking all of its catchup benefits with its dubious sense of rule of law. This article asks if the two initiatives can coexist with the entry of India into the game and form an equilibrium of ?grand coalition?, benefiting all its players as ?win-win-win? game, which turns out to be feasible and unstable. Nevertheless, Japan still seems to have a good reason to keep India as a strategic partner of FOIP as well as a ?gateway? for Central and Western Asia with fragile states such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, and official development assistance (ODA) could play a significant catalyst role as ?human security? promoted by Professor Amartya Sen and ex-UNHCR Ms. Sadako Ogata.

To provide for such critical requirements it is essential to prioritize the forwarding of different types of data varies based on their throughput requirements and the delay sensitivities. In this paper, we study the network Quality of Service (QoS) control mechanism for e-Health services using the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) approach in a Fog based Healthcare Environment. We distinguish the data generated from various types of devices into priority classes looking at their priorities, throughput and privacy requirements in the application. Hence, we propose, OpenHealthQ, an OpenFlow based traffic shaping model using OpenFlow Queues to handle the healthcare data. OpenHealthQ provides a secure, on-demand and low-cost access to Healthcare 4.0's most demanding computing infrastructure in a distributed cloud architecture with SDN based fog nodes at the network's edge.

Several issues have hindered progress in HAR research, particularly due to the emergence of fog and edge computing, which brings many new opportunities (a low latency, dynamic and real-time decision making, etc.) but comes with its challenges. This paper focuses on addressing two important research gaps in HAR research: (i) improving the HAR prediction accuracy and (ii) managing the frequent changes in the environment and data related to user activities. To address this, we propose an HAR method based on Soft-Voting and Self-Learning (SVSL). SVSL uses two strategies. First, to enhance accuracy, it combines the capabilities of Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost classifiers using soft-voting. Second, to classify the most challenging data instances, the SVSL method is equipped with a self-training mechanism that generates training data and retrains itself. We investigate the performance of our proposed SVSL method using two publicly available datasets on six human activities related to lying, sitting, and walking positions. The first dataset consists of 562 features and the second dataset consists of five features. The data are collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone sensors. The results show that the proposed method provides 6.26%, 1.75%, 1.51%, and 4.40% better prediction accuracy (average over the two datasets) compared to GLM, DL, RF, and AdaBoost, respectively. We also analyze and compare the class-wise performance of the SVSL methods with that of DL, GLM, RF, and AdaBoost.","Albeshri, Aiiad",Algorithms,602,1

However, the amount of temporal variation in dispersal and its consequences for metapopulation dynamics is largely unknown for organisms with environmentally driven dispersal (e.g., many marine larvae, arthropods, and plant seeds). Here, we quantify variation in the dispersal kernel across seven years and monsoon seasons for a common coral reef fish, Amphiprion clarkii, using genetic parentage assignments. Connectivity patterns varied strongly among years and seasons in the scale and shape but not in the direction of dispersal. This interannual variation in dispersal kernels introduced temporal covariance among dispersal routes with overall positive correlations in connections across the metapopulation that may reduce stochastic metapopulation growth rates. The extent of variation in mean dispersal distance observed here among years is comparable in magnitude to the differences across reef fish species. Considering dispersal variability will be an important avenue for further metapopulation and metacommunity research across diverse taxa.","Catalano, Katrina A.; Dedrick, Allison G.; Stuart, Michelle R.; Puritz, Jonathan B.; Montes, Humberto R.; Pinsky, Malin L.",bioRxiv,602,26

OBJECTIVE To determine whether monitoring cytokine production could contribute to the better management of pediatric patients with HIV-1 infection. SETTING Clinical Immunology Laboratory and Pediatrics Department, University Hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS Ten Asian and 2 Eurasian children infected with HIV-1 by mother-to-child transmission were followed for up to 5 years while on treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Numbers of unstimulated and mitogen-activated cytokine-secreting cells (IFN-gamma, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) were measured by ELISPOT assay at frequent intervals, and correlations were sought with CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts and viral loads. RESULTS Mitogen-stimulated IL-2-secreting cells were directly associated with recovery of CD4+ cells. Correlations with viral load were found for Con A-induced IFN-gamma, Con A-induced IL-4, and unstimulated IL-10, suggesting that these cytokines were either suppressed by high virus levels or that higher cytokine levels suppressed virus. IFN-gamma, IL-2-, IL-4-, and IL-12-secreting cells induced by PHA, Con A, and/or SAC tended to increase for the first 3-4 years of treatment but declined thereafter. CONCLUSIONS Alterations in cytokine profiles were not associated with adverse clinical events and there was little evidence to indicate that monitoring cytokine enzyme-linked immunospots (ELISPOTs) could contribute to pediatric patient management.","Jones, Brian M; Chiu, Susan S S; Wong, Wilfred H S; Lim, Wilina W L; Lau, Yu-lung",MedGenMed : Medscape general medicine,602,19

The Conference was a follow-up to the WHO Conference of May 2005 in Phuket, Thailand on the Earthquake and Tsunami of 26 December 2004. The invitational meeting brought together representatives of 11 countries impacted by the events. The goal of the Conference was to produce a plan of action that meets the specific needs of the countries and ensure that the countries of the Region will be better equipped to cope with any future event. OBJECTIVES The objectives of the Conference were to: (1) identify gaps in the health needs of the affected and vulnerable populations for preparedness, responses, recovery, and rehabilitation; (2) determine the next steps in addressing these gaps; and (3) develop benchmarks and a corresponding framework for action that must be achieved to solidify the capacities and capabilities of the health sector to meet emergencies. METHODS Presentations of background papers, panel discussions, and Working Groups were used. Based, in part, on the materials presented, the Working Groups drafted benchmarks that could mark the progress in achieving the overall goal and proposed strategies that could be used to reach the benchmarks. Representatives of the participating countries summarized the current status of their respective countries relative to each of the defined benchmarks. RESULTS The benchmarks relate to: (1) legal framework for preparedness and response; (2) national disaster plan for preparedness and response; (3) budget; (4) rules of engagement for external actors; (5) community plan based on risk identification and vulnerability assessment; (6)community-based capacities; (7) local capacity for provision of essential services and supplies; (8) awareness and advocacy programs; (9) identification of hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities; (10) education and training; (11) ""safe"" health facilities; and (12) surveillance and early warning systems. There exists a wide range in the levels of preparedness at all levels in the affected countries particularly at the community level. The country representatives agreed that community-level preparedness, legal frameworks, local and national disaster plans, surveillance and early warning systems, and advocacy and awareness programs demand more attention. The strategies and mechanisms that will facilitate achievement of the benchmarks were grouped into seven categories: (1) monitoring, evaluation, surveillance, and assessments; (2) education and training (human resource development); (3) information and communications; (4) legislation, policies, and authority; (5) funding; (6) planning and preparedness; and (7) coordination and control. Any or all of the strategies suggested could be implemented by the countries in the Region. CONCLUSION The Conference delivered an important set of benchmarks and strategies that, when implemented, will facilitate the countries and the communities within them reaching better levels of preparedness and response to future events.

METHODS This cross-sectional study collected data from travelers to Christchurch International Airport, New Zealand, in winter 2008, via a health questionnaire, temperature testing, and respiratory sampling. RESULTS Forms were returned by 15 976 (68%) travelers. Of these, 17% reported at least 1 influenza symptom, with runny or blocked nose (10%) and cough (8%) most common. Respiratory specimens were obtained from 3769 travelers. Estimated prevalence of influenza was 1.1% (4% among symptomatic, 0.2% among asymptomatic). The sensitivity of screening criteria ranged from 84% for ""any symptom"" to 3% for a fever of 37.8 ÂºC or greater. The positive predictive value was low for all criteria. CONCLUSIONS Border screening using self-reported symptoms and temperature testing has limitations for preventing pandemic influenza from entering a country. Using ""any symptom"" or cough would lead to many uninfected people being investigated, yet some infected people would remain undetected. If more specific criteria such as fever were used, most infected people would enter the country despite screening.","Priest, Patricia C; Jennings, Lance C; Duncan, Alasdair R; Brunton, Cheryl R; Baker, Michael G",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,602,9

METHODS This is a prospective cohort of six patients treated at Grady Memorial Hospital Burn Center (Atlanta, GA) from 2008 to 2009. Burn patients undergoing multi-modality pain therapy for chronic, painful burns were identified and consented for intervention. All patients underwent operative excision of the painful scar and placement of a bilayer dermal matrix (Integra). After 3 weeks the silicone mesh was removed, excessive granulation tissue was debrided, and a new split-thickness skin graft was placed on the wound. Prescription history and a patient questionnaire were used to collect data. RESULTS All patients noticed improvement of symptoms post-operatively. Two patients (33%) experienced complete reduction of scar pain and three (50%) discontinued consumption of pain medications. At a mean follow up of 13 months, the average amount of narcotic-based pain medications decreased from 63.3 MED ([morphine equivalent per day], range: 30-135) before treatment to 7.5 MED (range: 0-20) postoperatively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Scar excision, interval placement of a bilayer dermal matrix, and subsequent skin grafting is a new technique that can improve, and in some cases ameliorate, burn scar related pain. ﻿﻿﻿.","Moyer, Hunter R; Yezhelyev, Maksym; Ingram, Walter L",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,602,1

Everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. The article focuses on pathogens monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all European Union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. Currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetti and Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC)/Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli (STEC). As particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. The article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ECDC but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: Streptococcus iniae, S. suis, S. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: Staphylococcus intermedius, S. pseudintermedius. Those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. The exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. These abilities derive from DNA rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. Substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.","Ciszewski, Marcin; Czekaj, Tomasz; Szewczyk, Eligia Maria",Medycyna pracy,602,28

Seroassays also included samples obtained in 2003 from eight red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) housed at the same institution. All individuals had been vaccinated with a Chinese canine vaccine that included modified live CDV, CPV, CAV, CCV, and CPIV. Positive antibody titers were found only against CDV, CPV, and T. gondii. Sera were negative for antibodies against the other six pathogens. Results indicate that the quality of the vaccine may not be reliable and that it should not be considered protective or safe in giant pandas and red pandas. Positive antibody titers against T. gondii were found in seven of the 19 giant pandas. The clinical, subclinical, or epidemiologic significance of infection with these pathogens via natural exposure or from modified live vaccines in giant pandas is unknown.

It causes diarrhea in adult animals (winter dysentery), as well as enteric and respiratory diseases in calves. The annual occurrence of BCoV epidemics in Sweden and Denmark led to this investigation, with the aim to deepen the knowledge of BCoV epidemiology at the molecular level. A total of 43 samples from outbreaks in both countries were used for PCR amplification and direct sequencing of a 624-nucleotide fragment of the BCoV S gene. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies were performed. The results showed (i) identical sequences from different animals in the same herds and from paired nasal and fecal samples, suggesting a dominant virus circulating in each herd at a given time; (ii) sequence differences among four outbreaks in different years in the same herd, indicating new introduction of virus; (iii) identical sequences in four different Danish herds in samples obtained within 2 months, implying virus transmission between herds; and (iv) that at least two different virus strains were involved in the outbreaks of BCoV in Denmark during the spring of 2003. This study presents molecular data of BCoV infections that will contribute to an increased understanding of BCoV epidemiology in cattle populations.","Liu, Lihong; Hägglund, Sara; Hakhverdyan, Mikhayil; Alenius, Stefan; Larsen, Lars Erik; Belák, Sándor",Journal of clinical microbiology,602,1

We report antibacterial properties of a novel antimicrobial peptidyl derivative, (2S)-2-(N(alpha)-benzyloxycarbonyl-arginyl-leucylamido)-1-[(E)-cinnamoylamido]-3- methylbutane, structurally based upon the aminoterminal segment of the inhibitory centre of the human cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C. METHODS Clinical isolates of group A, B, C and G streptococci were collected. The antibacterial activity of Cystapep 1 derivative was tested by agar well diffusion method. RESULTS Cystapep 1, displayed antibacterial activity against several clinically important Gram-positive bacteria. It displayed minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of about 16 microg/ml for both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In radial agar diffusion assays, groups A, B, C and G streptococci as well as staphylococci were generally susceptible to the action of Cystapep 1, whereas pneumococci and enterococci were less susceptible. No activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION Cystapep 1 also showed high activity against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) and multi-antibiotic resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), suggesting its mechanism of action to be different from most currently used antibiotics.","Jasir, A; Kasprzykowski, F; Lindström, V; Schalén, C; Grubb, A",The Indian journal of medical research,602,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: Between the onset of pandemics and January 2021, approximately 9000 patients have been treated for conf i rmed COVID-19 in the Olexandrivska Clinical Hospital. Assessment of all hospitalized patients included hematology, chemistries and proinf l ammatory cytokines - IL-6, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin. Diagnosis was conf i rmed by PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Chest X-ray was performed in all hospitalized cases, while CT was available approximately in 30% of cases during hospital stay. Lung ultrasound was proactively utilized to assess the type and extent of lung damage and to monitor the progress of disease in patients hospitalized into the ICU and Infection Unit (n=135). Ultrasound fi ndings were recorded numerically based on scales. RESULTS Results: In the setting of СOVID-19, bedside lung ultrasound has been promptly recognized as a tool to diagnose and monitor the nature and extent of lung injury. Lung ultrasound is a real time assessment, which helps determine the nature of a pathologic process af f ecting lungs. In this paper the accuracy of bedside LUS, chest X-ray and computer tomography are compared based on clinical cases, typical for COVID-19 lung ultrasound appearance is evaluated. Described in article data is collected in one of the biggest facility that deals with COVID-19. Chest X-ray was performed in all hospitalized cases, while CT was available approximately in 30% of cases during hospital stay. The cases presented in the paper indicate potential advantages to the use of ultrasound in limited resource healthcare settings, especially when the risk of transportation to CT outweighs the value of information obtained. CONCLUSION Conclusions: Grading of ultrasonographic findings in the lungs was suf f i cient for both initial assessment with identif ication of high risk patients, and routine daily monitoring. Hence, lung ultrsound may be used to predict deterioration, stratify risks and make clinical decisions.","Pronyuk, Khrystyna O; Kondratiuk, Liudmyla O; Vysotskyi, Andrii D; Golubovska, Olga A; Nikitina, Iryna M",Wiadomosci lekarskie,602,0

This has raised questions concerning the role of the transmembrane domain (TMD) in the correct native folding of the ectodomain. Here, we show that an ectodomain anchored in the membrane by a glycophosphatidylinositol is also folded in an alternative conformation, whereas replacement of the TMD of G by other peptide TMDs results in correct antigenicity of G. However, mutants with an insertion of a hydrophilic linker between the ectodomain and the TMD also fold in an alternative conformation.

We construct a deterministic compartmental model to examine the potential impact of preemptive mass influenza vaccination on SARS containment during a hypothetical SARS outbreak coinciding with a peak flu season. Our model was developed based upon the events of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, Canada. The relationship of different vaccination rates for influenza and the corresponding required quarantine rates for individuals who are exposed to SARS was analyzed and simulated under different assumptions. The study revealed that a campaign of mass influenza vaccination prior to the onset of flu season could aid the containment of a future SARS outbreak by decreasing the total number of persons with ILIs presenting to the health-care system, and consequently decreasing nosocomial transmission of SARS in persons under investigation for the disease.","Zeng, Qingling; Khan, Kamran; Wu, Jianhong; Zhu, Huaiping",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,602,22

In addition, although MRI is six to 10 times more sensitive than clinical exacerbations in indexing disease activity, any possible association between URTI and MRI activity has yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVES To examine the relation between URTI and disease activity, in multiple sclerosis patients participating in a placebo controlled trial of interferon beta-1a, as indexed both by clinical exacerbation rate and by the number and volume of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhancing lesions on MRI. ""At risk"" periods were defined around symptomatic URTI, with or without serological confirmation. RESULTS The relative risk of clinical relapse for serologically unconfirmed symptomatic URTI was 2.1 (p=0.004). Raised antiviral antibody titres conferred a relative risk of multiple sclerosis exacerbations that was 3.4 times higher than the ""not at risk"" periods (annual attack rates of 5.7 v 1.6, respectively, p=0.006). There was no definite relation between the number or the volume of active lesions on MRI and either symptomatic or serologically defined at risk periods. CONCLUSIONS These results confirm the previously reported association between viral infections and multiple sclerosis exacerbations and indicate that the relative risk may be even higher when viral infection is serologically confirmed. However, the results, perhaps because of the confounding effects of interferon beta-1a, do not provide convincing evidence of increased blood-brain barrier breakdown or inflammation during periods of virally induced immune stimulation.","Edwards, S; Zvartau, M; Clarke, H; Irving, W; Blumhardt, L D","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",602,20

To determine whether HECV-4408 infects gnotobiotic calves and induces cross-protective immunity against the virulent enteric BCoV DB2 strain, gnotobiotic calves (n = 4) were orally inoculated with HECV-4408 and then challenged with BCoV DB2 at postinoculation day (PID) 21. All calves inoculated with HECV-4408 developed diarrhea at PID 3 to 4 lasting 5 to 9 days. Fecal and nasal virus shedding were first detected by reverse transcription-PCR at PID 3 to 4 and at PID 2 to 4, respectively. After challenge with bovine coronavirus, no diarrhea or virus shedding was detected in calves inoculated with HECV-4408, but a mock-inoculated calf developed diarrhea and fecal and nasal shedding. Fecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum IgG antibodies were first detected at PID 7 and PID 14, respectively. At postchallenge day 7, serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody titers remained the same or increased only twofold compared to prechallenge titers. An additional two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with HECV-4408 and euthanized at PID 5. Moderate villous atrophy was observed in the small intestines, and viral antigen was detected in villous enterocytes of the small and large intestines by immunohistochemistry. These results support and extend the previous report that HECV-4408 is likely a variant of bovine coronavirus.

Of the six mutations mapping in the multifunctional replicase protein nsP2, three were located in the N-terminal helicase region and three were in the C-terminal protease domain. Wild-type and mutant nsP2s were expressed, purified, and assayed for nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase), RNA triphosphatase (RTPase), and protease activities in vitro at 24 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The protease domain mutants (ts4, ts6, and ts11) had reduced protease activity at 35 degrees C but displayed normal NTPase and RTPase. The helicase domain mutation ts1 did not have enzymatic consequences, whereas ts13a and ts9 reduced both NTPase and protease activities but in different and mutant-specific ways. The effects of these helicase domain mutants on protease function suggest interdomain interactions within nsP2. NTPase activity was not directly required for protease activity. The similarities of the NTPase and RTPase results, as well as competition experiments, suggest that these two reactions utilize the same active site. The mutations were also studied in recombinant viruses first cultivated at the permissive temperature and then shifted up to the restrictive temperature. Processing of the nonstructural polyprotein was generally retarded in cells infected with viruses carrying the ts4, ts6, ts11, and ts13a mutations, and a specific defect appeared in ts9. All mutations except ts13a were associated with a large reduction in the production of the subgenomic 26S mRNA, indicating that both protease and helicase domains influence the recognition of the subgenomic promoter during virus replication.","Balistreri, Giuseppe; Caldentey, Javier; Kääriäinen, Leevi; Ahola, Tero",Journal of virology,602,17

In order for medical student education to continue, virtual and online electives were designed and implemented expeditiously. We created a virtual curriculum that taught quality improvement (QI) skills within the context of the global pandemic. Methods: This 4-week curriculum enrolled 16 students. Students completed the revised QI knowledge application tool (QIKAT-R) before and after the course to assess QI knowledge. Students completed prereading, online modules, and received lectures on QI and incident command systems. Each group designed their own QI project related to our hospital system's response to the pandemic. Finally, groups presented their projects at a peer symposium and completed peer evaluations. Results: Students' QIKAT-R scores improved throughout the course from a mean of 5.5 (SD = 1.3) to a mean of 7.5 (SD = 1.1; p < 0.001). Students reported that the virtual learning experience delivered the material effectively, and all students agreed that they would participate in QI work in the future. Discussion: Patient safety and QI topics are content areas for multiple medical licensing examinations. Virtual learning is an effective way to deliver QI content to medical students and residents, especially when projects are trainee-led, QI-trained faculty serve as mentors, and the projects harmonize with institutional goals. Our virtual pandemic-focused curriculum has demonstrated efficacy in increasing medical student QI knowledge.","Donohue, Katelyn E; Farber, Dara L; Goel, Nidhi; Parrino, Christopher R; Retener, Norman F; Rizvi, Syedmehdi; Dittmar, Philip C",MedEdPORTAL,602,16

Facebook, being the biggest social media platform, plays a significant role in the spread of information influencing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) use social media as a platform to impart information regarding COVID-19; simultaneously, there is a spread of misinformation on social media, masking the credible sources of information. Our research aims to assess the utility of Facebook in providing misinformation and testing its ""fact-check policy."" Methods An online search was conducted on Facebook by a newly created account to eliminate bias. The Facebook search bar was used to investigate multiple keywords. Data were tabulated in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Descriptive statistical analysis of Facebook accounts and posts was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) while statistical importance was set a priority at a p-value of 0.05. Results Our study consisted of 454 Facebook posts. Most (22.5%) were posted by verified accounts and 23.9% by informal individual/group accounts. The tone for most (40.4%) COVID-19 information was serious while the most common (43.9%) topic was medical/public health. In total, 22.3% included misinformation, 19.6% were unverifiable, and 27.5% included correct information verifiable by the WHO or CDC. Conclusions Misinformation/unverifiable information related to the COVID-19 crisis is spreading at a distressing rate on social media. We quantified the misinformation and tested Facebook's ""fact-check policy."" We advise strict initiatives to control this infodemic and advise future researches to evaluate the accuracy of content being circulated on other social media platforms.","Ahmed, Naseem; Shahbaz, Tooba; Shamim, Asma; Shafiq Khan, Kiran; Hussain, S M; Usman, Asad",Cureus,602,1

Public Health England initiated a study, COVID-19 Surveillance in School KIDs (sKIDs), in primary schools when they partially reopened from June 1, 2020, after the first national lockdown in England to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence, and seroconversion in staff and students. METHODS: sKIDs, an active, prospective, surveillance study, included two groups: the weekly swabbing group and the blood sampling group. The swabbing group underwent weekly nasal swabs for at least 4 weeks after partial school reopening during the summer half-term (June to mid-July, 2020). The blood sampling group additionally underwent blood sampling for serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to measure previous infection at the beginning (June 1-19, 2020) and end (July 3-23, 2020) of the summer half-term, and, after full reopening in September, 2020, and at the end of the autumn term (Nov 23-Dec 18, 2020). We tested for predictors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity using logistic regression. We calculated antibody seroconversion rates for participants who were seronegative in the first round and were tested in at least two rounds. FINDINGS: During the summer half-term, 11 966 participants (6727 students, 4628 staff, and 611 with unknown staff or student status) in 131 schools had 40 501 swabs taken. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 4·1 (one of 24 463; 95% CI 0·1-21·8) per 100 000 students and 12·5 (two of 16 038; 1·5-45·0) per 100 000 staff. At recruitment, in 45 schools, 91 (11·2%; 95% CI 7·9-15·1) of 816 students and 209 (15·1%; 11·9-18·9) of 1381 staff members were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, similar to local community seroprevalence. Seropositivity was not associated with school attendance during lockdown (p=0·13 for students and p=0·20 for staff) or staff contact with students (p=0·37). At the end of the summer half-term, 603 (73·9%) of 816 students and 1015 (73·5%) of 1381 staff members were still participating in the surveillance, and five (four students, one staff member) seroconverted. By December, 2020, 55 (5·1%; 95% CI 3·8-6·5) of 1085 participants who were seronegative at recruitment (in June, 2020) had seroconverted, including 19 (5·6%; 3·4-8·6) of 340 students and 36 (4·8%; 3·4-6·6) of 745 staff members (p=0·60).

Access to laboratory confirmation is limited and thus most reported figures are based on clinical diagnosis alone, the accuracy of which is uncertain. This systematic review assesses the diagnostic accuracy of the traditional (1997) and revised (2009) WHO clinical case definitions for dengue fever, the basis for most national guidelines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, OpenGrey, and the annual Dengue Bulletin were searched for studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the unmodified clinical criteria. Two reviewers (NR/SL) independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias using a modified QUADAS-2. Additional records were found by citation network analysis. A meta-analysis was done using a bivariate mixed-effects regression model. Studies that modified criteria were analysed separately. This systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020165998). We identified 11 and 12 datasets assessing the 1997 and 2009 definition, respectively, and 6 using modified criteria. Sensitivity was 93% (95% CI: 77-98) and 93% (95% CI: 86-96) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Specificity was 29% (95% CI: 8-65) and 31% (95% CI: 18-48) for the 1997 and 2009 definitions, respectively. Diagnostic performance suffered at the extremes of age. No modification significantly improved accuracy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnostic accuracy of clinical criteria is poor, with significant implications for surveillance and public health responses for dengue control. As the basis for most reported figures, this has relevance to policymakers planning resource allocation and researchers modelling transmission, particularly during COVID-19.","Raafat, Nader; Loganathan, Shanghavie; Mukaka, Mavuto; Blacksell, Stuart D; Maude, Richard James",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,602,16

METHODS: A PRISMA guided systematic review was conducted using the databases Ovid-Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science to identify relevant articles discussing ethical issues relating to research in low prevalence COVID-19 countries. RESULTS: The search yielded 133 original articles of which only 2 fit the inclusion criteria and aim, with neither specific to low prevalence. Most of the available literature focused on clinical management and resource allocation related to high prevalence countries. These results will be discussed under the ethical dimensions of equity, individual liberty, privacy and confidentiality, proportionality, public protection, provision of care, reciprocity, stewardship and trust.. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review failed to identify articles relating to COVID-19 research ethics, specific to low prevalence countries. It shows that there is a significant gap in the literature that warrants further investigation. Common ethical principles were used to present a distinct set of challenges experienced by a country with a low prevalence of COVID-19.

The etiologic agent of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infects the intestinal epithelium, and can induce GI symptoms similar to the human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). An international surveillance epidemiology study (SECURE-IBD) reported that the standardized mortality ratio trends higher in IBD patients (1.5-1.8) and that mesalamine/sulfasalazine therapy correlates with poor outcome. The goal of our study was to experimentally address the relationship between mesalamine and SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication, and/or pathogenesis. MethodsViral infection was performed with a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and EGFP (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 virus derived from an infectious cDNA clone of 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020. Primary human ileal spheroids derived from healthy donors were grown as 3D spheroids or on 2D transwells. We assessed the effect of 10 mM mesalamine (Millipore Sigma) on viral RNA levels, as well as the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin II-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), TMPRSS4, Cathepsin B (CTSB) and CTSL by qRT-PCR. 8-12 week old K18-ACE2 were treated orally with PBS or mesalamine at 200 mg/kg daily. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 1x103 FFU of SARS-CoV-2. Mice were weighed daily and viral titers were determined 7 days post infection (dpi) by qRT-PCR. For the intestinal viral entry model, VSV-SARS-CoV-2 was injected into a ligated intestinal loop of anesthetized K18-ACE2 mice and tissues were harvested 6 hours post-infection. ResultsWe found no change in viral RNA levels in human intestinal epithelial cells in response to mesalamine. Expression of ACE2 was reduced following mesalamine treatment in enteroids, while CTSL expression was increased. Mice receiving mesalamine lost weight at similar rates compared to mice receiving vehicle control. Mesalamine treatment did not change viral load in the lung, heart, or intestinal tissues harvested at 7 dpi. Pretreatment with mesalamine did not modulate intestinal entry of the chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2 in K18-ACE2 mice. ConclusionsMesalamine did not alter viral entry, replication, or pathogenesis in vitro or in mouse models. Mesalamine treatment reduced expression of the viral receptor ACE2 while concurrently increasing CTSL expression in human ileum organoids.","Alvarado, David M; Son, Juhee; Thackray, Larissa B.; Diamond, Michael; Ding, Siyuan; Ciorba, Matthew A.; Group, - Washington University IBD Investigators",,602,1

Outcome measures were administered at patients’ initial and final appointment. Information was merged into a single database and imported into IBM SPSS for retrospective analysis. The following measures were administered at the beginning and end of treatment and were used to evaluate patient progress;Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS), Life Skills Profile (LSP), Session Rating Scale (SRS), Outcome Rating Scale (ORS).ResultTwo cohorts were derived from the clinic;the first cohort (n = 90;53 females;37 males;M = 35.72 years;SD = 12.12 years) comprised of those patients whose care occurred between 23/09/2019 and 22/03/2020 and did not receive telehealth appointments. The second cohort (n = 122;68 females;54 males;M = 36.2 years;SD = 12.78 years) were those patients who presented to the clinic and were discharged between 23/03/2020 and 21/09/2020 and received at least one telehealth appointment. In the pre-telehealth cohort, mean HoNOS scores at baseline were 17.87 compared to 13.53 at discharge, mean LSP scores at baseline were 10.76 compared to 9.01 at discharge, mean SRS scores at baseline were 34.17 compared to 36.04 at discharge, and mean ORS scores at baseline were 12.97 compared to 21.28 at discharge. In the post-telehealth cohort, mean HoNOS scores at baseline were 14.45 compared to 10.50 at discharge, mean LSP scores at baseline were 7.85 compared to 7.19 at discharge, mean SRS scores at baseline were 36.04 compared to 35.36 at discharge, and mean ORS scores at baseline were 18.83 compared to 15.85 at discharge.ConclusionResults show that telehealth did not impact negatively on the therapeutic effect of clinical sessions, highlighted by similar reductions in HoNOS and LSP scores. It was seen in the post-telehealth cohort that there was worsening in the subject-rated scales (SRS and ORS) which was not seen in the pre-telehealth face-to-face cohort. Thus, there seems to be a discernible negative difference from the patient's perspective in the clinical sessions. This may be due to the difficulties in therapeutic alliance using the telehealth platform. We appreciate that there are a number of confounding factors, especially the effect of COVID-19 isolation. Telehealth is a useful addition to our assessment and treatment paradigms and its use should continue;however, we should be aware of the potential negative effect on therapeutic alliance.","Dhar, Arup Edwards Liam Waerea Moana",BJPsych Open,602,16

This process affects over 1 million patients annually within the specialty of family medicine. The purpose of this project was to implement a structured, year-end reassignment system in a family medicine residency program. METHODS: Our structured reassignment process took place from December 2017 through June 2020. Panel lists of current, active patients were generated and residents were responsible for reassigning their own panels during a panel reassignment night. We created a tip sheet that addressed patient complexity and continuity, a risk stratification algorithm based on patients' medical and social complexity, and a tool that tracked the number of patients assigned to each future provider. Outcome measures included a resident satisfaction survey administered in 2018-2020 and patient-provider continuity measured with a run chart from December 2016 through August 2020. RESULTS: The resident survey response rate was 75%. Seventy-three percent felt the panel reassignment night was very helpful; 87% thought the reassignment timeline was extremely reasonable, and 87% indicated that they had the necessary information to reassign their patients. Residents also felt confident that their patients were reassigned appropriately (33% extremely confident, 67% somewhat confident). Patient continuity improved with a 13-point run above the median, indicating nonrandom variation. Patient continuity remained above the median until the impact of COVID-19 in April 2020. CONCLUSION: Our structured reassignment process was received positively by residents and resulted in improved patient continuity.","Compton, Rebekah; Sebring, Amanda; Dalrymple, Sarah; Rollins, Lisa K",Fam Med,602,16

The article also presents the results of a study examining the relationships between COVID-19 demands (e.g., lack of personal protective equipment, concerns about infecting family members), resources (meaningful work, social support), and mental health strain within a sample of emergency medicine personnel over six consecutive weeks. COVID-related demands and hours worked were hypothesized to be positively related to mental health strain, whereas meaningful work and social support were hypothesized to be negatively related to mental health strain. Hours worked the prior week were hypothesized to exacerbate the positive relationships between COVID-19 demands and mental health strain, whereas the resources of meaningful work and social support were expected to buffer the relationships. Multilevel models controlling for mental health strain the prior week revealed that COVID-19 demands, along with hours worked, were each related to higher mental health strain during the week. Hours worked magnified the within-person relationship between personal COVID-19 demands and mental health strain. Contrary to hypotheses, social support and meaningful work were not related to mental health strain.

As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded in late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was at the forefront in the development of risk communication strategies. The WHO introduced a range of activities with the purpose of enabling the public to avail verified and timely information on COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Given the various WHO activities to protect the public health during COVID-19, it is important to investigate the extent of familiarity and uptake of the WHO recommendations among the public during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: To do this, we conducted a large-scale Pan-European survey covering around 7500 individuals that are representative of populations from seven European countries, collected online during April 2-April 15, 2020. We use descriptive statistics including proportions and correlations and graphical representations such as bar charts to analyze and display the data. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that information from the WHO in the context of COVID-19 is well trusted and acted upon by the public. Overall familiarity and adherence were quite high in most countries. Adherence was higher for social distancing recommendations compared to hygiene measures. Familiarity and adherence were higher among older, female, and highly educated respondents. However, country level heterogeneities were observed in the level of trust in information from the WHO, with countries severely affected by the pandemic reporting lower levels of trust. CONCLUSION: Our findings call for efforts from health authorities to get regular feedback from the public on their familiarity and compliance with recommendations for preventive measures at all stages of the pandemic, to further develop and adapt risk communication as the pandemic evolves.","Varghese, Nirosha Elsem; Sabat, Iryna; Neumann-Böhme, Sebastian; Schreyögg, Jonas; Stargardt, Tom; Torbica, Aleksandra; van Exel, Job; Barros, Pedro Pita; Brouwer, Werner",PLoS One,602,16

However, existing methods often lack the essential ability to generate examples with requested properties, such as the age of the person in the photo or the weight of the generated molecule. Incorporating such additional conditioning factors would require rebuilding the entire architecture and optimizing the parameters from scratch. Moreover, it is difficult to disentangle selected attributes so that to perform edits of only one attribute while leaving the others unchanged. To overcome these limitations we propose PluGeN (Plugin Generative Network), a simple yet effective generative technique that can be used as a plugin to pre-trained generative models. The idea behind our approach is to transform the entangled latent representation using a flow-based module into a multi-dimensional space where the values of each attribute are modeled as an independent one-dimensional distribution. In consequence, PluGeN can generate new samples with desired attributes as well as manipulate labeled attributes of existing examples. Due to the disentangling of the latent representation, we are even able to generate samples with rare or unseen combinations of attributes in the dataset, such as a young person with gray hair, men with make-up, or women with beards. We combined PluGeN with GAN and VAE models and applied it to conditional generation and manipulation of images and chemical molecule modeling. Experiments demonstrate that PluGeN preserves the quality of backbone models while adding the ability to control the values of labeled attributes.","Wolczyk, Maciej; Proszewska, Magdalena; Maziarka, Lukasz; Zikeba, Maciej; Wielopolski, Patryk; Kurczab, Rafal; 'Smieja, Marek",,602,16

Results728,047 children in the N3C were tested for SARS-CoV-2; of these, 91,865 (12.6%) were positive. Among the 5,213 (6%) hospitalized children, 685 (13%) met criteria for severe disease: mechanical ventilation (7%), vasopressor/inotropic support (7%), ECMO (0.6%), or death/discharge to hospice (1.1%). Male gender, African American race, older age, and several pediatric complex chronic condition (PCCC) subcategories were associated with higher clinical severity (p[≤]0.05). Vital signs (all p[≤]0.002) and many laboratory tests from the first day of hospitalization were predictive of peak disease severity. Children with severe (vs moderate) disease were more likely to receive antimicrobials (71% vs 32%, p<0.001) and immunomodulatory medications (53% vs 16%, p<0.001). Compared to those with acute COVID-19, children with MIS-C were more likely to be male, Black/African American, 1-to-12-years-old, and less likely to have asthma, diabetes, or a PCCC (p<0.04). MIS-C cases demonstrated a more inflammatory laboratory profile and more severe clinical phenotype with higher rates of invasive ventilation (12% vs 6%) and need for vasoactive-inotropic support (31% vs 6%) compared to acute COVID-19 cases, respectively (p<0.03). ConclusionsIn the largest U.S. SARS-CoV-2-positive pediatric cohort to date, we observed differences in demographics, pre-existing comorbidities, and initial vital sign and laboratory test values between severity subgroups.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the ""phosphate tweezer"" CLR01, a ""carboxylate tweezer"" CLR05, and a ""phosphate clip"" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.","Weil, Tatjana; Groß, Rüdiger; Röcker, Annika; Bravo-Rodriguez, Kenny; Heid, Christian; Sowislok, Andrea; Le, My-Hue; Erwin, Nelli; Dwivedi, Mridula; Bart, Stephen M; Bates, Paul; Wettstein, Lukas; Müller, Janis A; Harms, Mirja; Sparrer, Konstantin; Ruiz-Blanco, Yasser B; Stürzel, Christina M; von Einem, Jens; Lippold, Sina; Read, Clarissa; Walther, Paul; Hebel, Marco; Kreppel, Florian; Klärner, Frank-Gerrit; Bitan, Gal; Ehrmann, Michael; Weil, Tanja; Winter, Roland; Schrader, Thomas; Shorter, James; Sanchez-Garcia, Elsa; Münch, Jan",J Am Chem Soc,602,16

Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine.

Pulmonary infection secondary to sepsis caused by CRKP has been reported only rarely in kidney transplant recipients. Here we report an interesting and complicated case in which CRKP was initially isolated in a culture of renal graft preservation solution, yet was not detected in the daily cultures from collection of surgical drainage. Prophylactic tigecycline was terminated at post-transplantation day 10 because of the occurrence of acute pancreatitis. Five days later, the patient suddenly developed a multisite infection with CRKP involving the bloodstream, urinary tract, and lungs, indicating probable transmission from the donor. Fortunately, the infection was controlled quickly and effectively with a combination therapy consisting of ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) and carbapenem, which was suggested by the results of disc diffusion susceptibility testing. However, the CRKP infection reappeared in the bloodstream and urinary tract soon after the treatment of acute rejection. The combination regimen was continued for another 15 days, and the patient ultimately recovered. During the following 15 months of observation, the patient's renal graft function remained stable, without recurrence of the CRKP infection. In conclusion, the combined use of CZA and carbapenem was safe and produced an optimal therapeutic effect on the severe multisite infection caused by CRKP in a renal transplant recipient, thus providing a reference case for treating such patients.","Wang, Zhiqiang; Ma, Ke; Chen, Zhongju; Guo, Zhiliang; Zhao, Guangyuan; Guo, Hui; Zhu, Lan; Chen, Gang",Transplant. proc,602,4
212791,212791,212791,A Review of State Guidelines for Elective Orthopaedic Procedures During the COVID-19 Outbreak,17.9847,6.4914985,2020,"During the first wave of COVID-19, hospitals were overwhelmed with the high number of admitted patients. An accurate prediction of the most likely individual disease progression can improve the planning of limited resources and finding the optimal treatment for patients. However, when dealing with a newly emerging disease such as COVID-19, the impact of patient- and disease-specific factors (e.g. body weight or known co-morbidities) on the immediate course of disease is by and large unknown. In the case of COVID-19, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission of pneumonia patients is often determined only by acute indicators such as vital signs (e.g. breathing rate, blood oxygen levels), whereas statistical analysis and decision support systems that integrate all of the available data could enable an earlier prognosis. To this end, we propose a holistic graph-based approach combining both imaging and non-imaging information. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal similarity metric to build a population graph for clustering patients and an image-based end-to-end Graph Attention Network to process this graph and predict the COVID-19 patient outcomes: admission to ICU, need for ventilation and mortality. Additionally, the network segments chest CT images as an auxiliary task and extracts image features and radiomics for feature fusion with the available metadata. Results on a dataset collected in Klinikum rechts der Isar in Munich, Germany show that our approach outperforms single modality and non-graph baselines. Moreover, our clustering and graph attention allow for increased understanding of the patient relationships within the population graph and provide insight into the network's decision-making process.","Keicher, Matthias; Burwinkel, Hendrik; Bani-Harouni, David; Paschali, Magdalini; Czempiel, Tobias; Burian, Egon; Makowski, Marcus R.; Braren, Rickmer; Navab, Nassir; Wendler, Thomas",,602,3

Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study involving 142 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate inflammation divided into three treatment groups (pulses of methylprednisolone alone [group I], tocilizumab alone [group II] and methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab [group III]). The aim was to assess intergroups differences in the clinical course with a 60-day follow-up and related analytical factors. Results: 14 patients (9,8%) died: 8 (10%) in group I and 6 (9,5%) in groups II and III. 15 (10,6%) were admitted to ICU: 2 (2,5%) from group I, 4 (28,5%) from group II and 9 (18,4%) from group III. The mean hospital stay was longer in group II and clinical outcome was not associated with treatment. Conclusions: Tocilizumab seems to be not associated with better clinical outcomes and should be reserved for clinical trial scenario, since its widespread use may result in higher rate of ICU admission and longer mean hospital stay without differences in mortality rate and potentially adverse events.","Aomar-Millán, Ismael Francisco; Salvatierra, Juan; Torres-Parejo, Úrsula; Nuñez-Nuñez, María; Hernández-Quero, José; Anguita-Santos, Francisco",,602,16

METHODS: We quantitatively analyzed ""coronavirus"" digital footprints on the Internet, in particular, on Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by EventRegistry, from 15.01 to 07.04.2020 (before and after official introduction of COVID-19 to Poland on 04.03.2020). We present results on trend analysis supported by statistical techniques. RESULTS: We identified six major temporal clusters of the interest on the topic COVID-19: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Physical distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield. There was an exponential increase of the interest when the Polish government ""declared a war against disease"" around 11/12.03.2020 with a massive response activity. Later on, there was a decay in the interest with additional phases related to physical distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act associated with pronounced local peaks. We have found that declarations of response strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So already enacted or in force events do not affect the interest to such an extent. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial search term ""antiviral mask"" in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia ""SARS-CoV-2"" as well as official COVID-19 incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual burden of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Interest in COVID-19 (measured by topic intensity on the Internet) is unrelated to the officially notified viral pressure (measured by incidence) and probably physical risk of acquiring infection in Poland. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.","Jarynowski, Andrzej; Wójta-Kempa, Monika; Belik, Vitaly",Przegl Epidemiol,602,16

CONCLUSION: In preparation of possible future pandemic outbreaks, key ethical aspects are to adapt patient management to local resources and infection prevalence, and circulate clear institutional guidelines.","Simon, François; Plisson, Laetitia; Heutte, Natacha; Leboulanger, Nicolas; Barry, Béatrix; Babin, Emmanuel; Parietti-Winkler, Cécile",Etique &amp; sante (Imprime),602,10
220217,220217,220217,Elective colorectal cancer surgery at the oncologic hub of Lombardy inside a pandemic COVID-19 area,17.841703,6.6494493,2020,"A frequently mentioned factor holding back the introduction of new vaccines on the market are their prohibitively long development timelines. These hamper their potential societal benefit and impairs the ability to quickly respond to emerging new pathogens. This is especially worrisome since new pathogens are emerging at all-time high rates of over one per year, and many age-old pathogens are still not vaccine preventable.Through interviews with 20 key-opinion-leaders (KOLs), this study identified innovation barriers that increase vaccine development timelines. These innovation barriers were visualized, and their underlying causes revealed by means of qualitative root cause analysis. Based on a survey the innovation barriers were quantitatively ranked based on their relative impact on both regular, and Covid-19 vaccine development timelines. KOLs identified 20 key innovation barriers, and mapping these barriers onto the Vaccine Innovation Cycle model revealed that all phases of vaccine development were affected. Affected by most barriers is the area between the preclinical studies and the market entry. Difficult hand-off between academia and industry, lack of funding, and lack of knowledge of pathogen targets were often mentioned as causes. Quantitative survey responses from 93 KOLs showed that general vaccine development and Covid-19 vaccine development are impacted by distinct sets of innovation barriers. For the general vaccine development three barriers were perceived of the highest impact; limited ROI for vaccines addressing disease with limited market size, limited ROI for vaccines compared to non-vaccine projects, and academia not being able to progress beyond proof of principle. Of highest impact on Covid-19 vaccine development, are lack of knowledge concerning pathogen target, high risk of upscaling unlicensed vaccines, and proof of principle not meeting late-stage requirements. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that barriers hampering timelines in vaccine development are present across the Vaccine Innovation Cycle. Prioritizing the impact of barriers in general, and in Covid-19 vaccine development, shows clear differences that can be used to inform policies to speed up development in both war and peace time.","Janse, Marga; Brouwers, Thomas; Claassen, Eric; Hermans, Peter; van de Burgwal, Linda",Front Public Health,602,23

This cross-sectional study attempts to reveal the underlying mental health conditions, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS), depression, and insomnia, relating to the pandemic situation, and to further examine the combined effects of gender and age on the COVID-19 related mental health consequences. An online survey was conducted among 2,992 adults in China from February 1st 2020 to February 10th 2020. The study uses binary logistic regression to analyze the potential factors associated with PTSD, depression, and insomnia. The results indicate that the prevalence of PTSS, depression, and insomnia are 19.5, 26.9, and 19.6% respectively during the COVID-19. Men and women show different rates of PTSS and depression, whereas no insomnia is found in both males and females. The females above 50 years of age have a lower level of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.448, 95%CI: 0.220-0.911, Cohen's d = -0.443) as compared with females aged 18-25; while the highest effect sizes for PTSS (OR = 2.846, 95%CI: 1.725-4.695, Cohen's d = 0.537) and the depression (OR = 2.024, 95%CI: 1.317-3.111, Cohen's d = 0.314) are seen in males aged 26 to 30. Besides gender, education, living conditions, direct exposure to COVID-19, the post mental and the physical health condition is related to PTSS, depression, and insomnia. Our study suggests that high-risk groups, especially those having two or more related factors and young men, should be the focus of mental health intervention.","Liu, Chengbin; Liu, Danxia; Huang, Ning; Fu, Mingqi; Ahmed, Jam Farooq; Zhang, Yanjun; Wang, Xiaohua; Wang, Yiqing; Shahid, Muhammad; Guo, Jing",Front Public Health,602,20

However, it remained to be addressed why this was the case. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To find the factors that potentially protect females from COVID-19, we recruited all confirmed patients hospitalized at three branches of Tongji Hospital (n=1902) from January 28 to March 8, 2020, and analyzed the correlation between menstrual status (n=509ï¼including 68 from Mobile Cabin Hospital)/female hormones (n=78)/ cytokines related to immunity and inflammation(n=263), and the severity/clinical outcomes in female patients under 60 years of age.Non-menopausal female patients had milder severity and better outcome compared with age-matched men (p<0.01/p<0.01). Menopausal patients had longer hospitalization times than non-menopausal patients ( hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46ï¼p= 0.033). Both anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol (E2) showed a negative correlation with severity of infection (AHR=0.146/0.304, 95%CI = [0.026-0.824]/[0.092-1.001], p=0.029/0.05). E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF&#945; in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023), and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030). CONCLUSION: Menopause is an independent risk factor for female COVID-19 patients. AMH and E2 are potential protective factors, negatively correlated with COVID-19's severity, among which E2 is attributed to its regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation. Hormone supplement might be a potential therapy for COVID-19 patients.","Ding, Ting; Zhang, Jinjin; Wang, Tian; Cui, Pengfei; Chen, Zhe; Jiang, Jingjing; Zhou, Su; Dai, Jun; Wang, Bo; Yuan, Suzhen; Ma, Wenqing; Ma, Lingwei; Rong, Yueguang; Chang, Jiang; Miao, Xiaoping; Ma, Xiangyi; Wang, Shixuan",Clin. infect. dis,602,1

Common fabrics of cotton, polyester, nylon, and silk had filtration efficiency of 5-25%, polypropylene spunbond had filtration efficiency 6-10%, and paper-based products had filtration efficiency of 10-20%. An advantage of polypropylene spunbond is that it can be simply triboelectrically charged to enhance the filtration efficiency (from 6 to >10%) without any increase in pressure (stable overnight and in humid environments).

In contemporary psychiatry, it is commonly suggested that this connection is a causal connection that has been established through empirical discovery. Herein, I examine the extent to which this claim can be sustained. I argue that the connection between mental disorder and increased suicide risk is not wholly causal but is partly conceptual. This in part relates to the way suicidality is built into the definitions of some psychiatric diagnoses. It also relates to the broader normative assumption that suicidal behavior is by definition mentally disordered behavior. The above has significant epistemological implications, which I explore. I propose that the claim that suicide is connected with mental disorder cannot be justified solely by appealing to empirical evidence but also warrants a justification on conceptual and normative grounds.","Maung, Hane Htut",J. med. philos,602,1

The Association of Korean Medicine (AKOM) established the COVID-19 telemedicine center of Korean medicine (KM telemedicine center) in Daegu and Seoul. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the results of the KM telemedicine center and the clinical possibility of using herbal medicines for COVID-19. METHODS: All procedures were conducted by voice call following standardized guidelines. The students in the reception group obtained informed consent from participants and they collected basic information. Subsequently, Korean Medicine doctors assessed COVID-19-related symptoms and prescribed the appropriate herbal medicine according to the KM telemedicine guidelines. The data of patients who completed the program by June 30, 2020, were analyzed. RESULTS: From March 9 to June 30, 2020, 2324 patients participated in and completed the KM telemedicine program. Kyung-Ok-Ko (n=2285) was the most prescribed herbal medicine, and Qingfei Paidu decoction (I and II, n=2053) was the second most prescribed. All COVID-19-related symptoms (headache, chills, sputum, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue, muscle pain, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, dyspnea, chest tightness, diarrhea, and loss of appetite) improved after treatment (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The KM telemedicine center has provided medical service to 10.8% of all patients with COVID-19 in South Korea (as of June 30, 2020), and it is still in operation. We hope that this study will help to establish a better health care system to overcome COVID-19.","Jang, Soobin; Kim, Dongsu; Yi, Eunhee; Choi, Gunhee; Song, Mideok; Lee, Eun-Kyoung",JMIR Public Health Surveill,602,15

However, the association of ACE2 expression levels with immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming in LUAD remains lacking. We investigated the expression level of ACE2, an association of ACE2 expression level with various types of immune signatures, immune ratios, and pathways. We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) R package to identify the gene modules and investigated prognostic roles of hub genes in LUAD. Overexpression of ACE2 level was found in LUAD and ACE2 expression was negatively associated with various types of immune signatures including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ regulatory T cells, NK cells, and T cell activation. Besides, ACE2 upregulation was not only associated with CD8+ T cell/CD4+ regulatory T cell ratios but also linked with downregulation of immune-markers including CD8A, KLRC1, GZMA, GZMB, NKG7, CCL4, and IFNG. Moreover, the ACE2 expression level was found to be associated with the enrichment level of various metabolic pathways and it was also found that the metabolic pathways are directly positively correlated with the increased expression levels of ACE2, indicating that the overexpression of ACE2 is associated with metabolic reprogramming in LUAD. Furthermore, WGCNA based analysis revealed the gene modules in the high-ACE2-expression-level group of LUAD and identified GCLC and SLC7A11 hub genes which are not only highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma but also correlated with the poor survival prognosis. Our analysis of ACE2 in LUAD tissues suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also associated with immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming. This study underlines the clue for understanding the clinical significance of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients with LUAD comorbidity.","Uddin, Md Nazim; Akter, Rehana; Li, Mengyuan; Abdelrahman, Zeinab",Chem Biol Interact,602,1

Strikingly, men account for the majority of COVID-19 deaths, with current figures ranging from 59% to 75% of total mortality. However, despite clear implications in relation to COVID-19 mortality, most research has not considered sex as a critical factor in data analysis. Here, we highlight fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females, and how these may make significant contributions to the male-biased COVID-19 mortality. We present preclinical evidence identifying the influence of biological sex on the expression and regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the main receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. However, we note that there is a lack of reports showing that sexual dimorphism of ACE2 expression exists and is of functional relevance in humans. In contrast, there is strong evidence, especially in the context of viral infections, that sexual dimorphism plays a central role in the genetic and hormonal regulation of immune responses, both of the innate and the adaptive immune system. We review evidence supporting that ineffective anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, coupled with a predisposition for inappropriate hyperinflammatory responses, could provide a biological explanation for the male bias in COVID-19 mortality. A prominent finding in COVID-19 is the increased risk of death with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and age. We contextualize how important features of sexual dimorphism and inflammation in COVID-19 may exhibit a reciprocal relationship with comorbidities, and explain their increased mortality risk. Ultimately, we demonstrate that biological sex is a fundamental variable of critical relevance to our mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pursuit of effective COVID-19 preventative and therapeutic strategies.","Bienvenu, Laura A; Noonan, Jonathan; Wang, Xiaowei; Peter, Karlheinz",Cardiovasc Res,602,21

Since the first detection, in December 2019, there have been no effective drug therapy options for treating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, healthcare professionals are using chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, convalescent plasma and some other options of treatments. This study aims to compare the biological, molecular, pharmacological, and clinical characteristics of these three treatment modalities for SARS-COV-2 infections, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Convalescent Plasma, and Remdesivir. Methods: A search was conducted in the ""Institute of Science Information (ISI)-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library databases, Scopus, and Google Scholar"" for peer reviewed, published studies and clinical trials through July 30, 2020. The search was based on keywords ""COVID-19"" SARS-COV-2, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, convalescent plasma, remdesivir and treatment modalities. Results: As of July 30, 2020, a total of 36,640 relevant documents were published. From them 672 peer reviewed, published articles, and clinical trials were screened. We selected 17 relevant published original articles and clinical trials: 05 for chloroquine and/or hydroxychloroquine with total sample size (nâ¯=â¯220), 05 for Remdesivir (nâ¯=â¯1,781), and 07 for Convalescent Plasma therapy (nâ¯=â¯398), with a combined total sample size (nâ¯=â¯2,399). Based on the available data, convalescent plasma therapy showed clinical advantages in SARS-COV-2 patients. Conclusions: All three treatment modalities have both favorable and unfavorable characteristics, but none showed clear evidence of benefit for early outpatient disease or prophylaxis. Based on the current available data, convalescent plasma therapy appears to show clinical advantages for inpatient use. In the future, ongoing large sample size randomized controlled clinical trials may further clarify the comparative efficacy and safety of these three treatment classes, to conclusively determine whom to treat with which drug and when to treat them.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Zaidi, Syed Ziauddin A; Shang, Trisha; Zhang, Jennifer Y; Al-Khlaiwi, Thamir; Bukhari, Ishfaq A; Akram, Javed; Klonoff, David C",,602,16

These foreign microbes can cause various diseases such as rhinitis, tuberculosis, dysentery and sometimes fatal viral diseases like AIDS and COVID-19 which are incurable till date. So to safeguard our body from such infection we have a potent system that is known as the immune system. This immune system helps in the removal of microbes by the means of immune cells like lymphocytes (B-cells and T-cells), macrophages and monocytes etc. these cells either remove the foreign particle from the blood stream itself or from the target site. Immunity can be enhanced by using immunity boosters and having a balanced lifestyle.

Identification of high-risk cases is critical for early intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop deep learning models that can rapidly identify high-risk COVID-19 patients based on computed tomography (CT) images and clinical data. METHODS: We analyzed 297 COVID-19 patients from five hospitals in Daegu, South Korea. A mixed artificial convolutional neural network (ACNN) model, combining an artificial neural network for clinical data and a convolutional neural network for 3D CT imaging data, was developed to classify these cases as either high risk of severe progression (ie, event) or low risk (ie, event-free). RESULTS: Using the mixed ACNN model, we were able to obtain high classification performance using novel coronavirus pneumonia lesion images (ie, 93.9% accuracy, 80.8% sensitivity, 96.9% specificity, and 0.916 area under the curve [AUC] score) and lung segmentation images (ie, 94.3% accuracy, 74.7% sensitivity, 95.9% specificity, and 0.928 AUC score) for event versus event-free groups.

Using hierarchical ascendant classification on principal component analysis of multidimensional variables, and multivariate analyses with generalised additive models, we assessed the associations between several factors (spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic between Feb 7 and March 17, 2020, the national lockdown, demographic population structure, baseline intensive care capacities, baseline population health and health-care services, new chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine dispensations, economic indicators, degree of urbanisation, and climate profile) and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates. Incidence rate was defined as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases per 100â000 inhabitants, mortality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per 100â000, and case fatality rate as the cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 deaths per cumulative number of in-hospital COVID-19 cases. FINDINGS: From March 19 to May 11, 2020, hospitals in metropolitan France notified a total of 100â988 COVID-19 cases, including 16â597 people who were admitted to intensive care and 17â062 deaths. There was an overall cumulative in-hospital incidence rate of 155·6 cases per 100â000 inhabitants (range 19·4-489·5), in-hospital mortality rate of 26·3 deaths per 100â000 (1·1-119·2), and in-hospital case fatality rate of 16·9% (4·8-26·2). We found clear spatial heterogeneity of in-hospital COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates, following the spread of the epidemic. After multivariate adjustment, the delay between the first COVID-19-associated death and the onset of the national lockdown was positively associated with in-hospital incidence (adjusted standardised incidence ratio 1·02, 95% CI 1·01-1·04), mortality (adjusted standardised mortality ratio 1·04, 1·02-1·06), and case fatality rates (adjusted standardised fatality ratio 1·01, 1·01-1·02). Mortality and case fatality rates were higher in departments with older populations (adjusted standardised ratio for populations with a high proportion older than aged >85 years 2·17 [95% CI 1·20-3·90] for mortality and 1·43 [1·08-1·88] for case fatality rate). Mortality rate was also associated with incidence rate (1·0004, 1·0002-1·001), but mortality and case fatality rates did not appear to be associated with baseline intensive care capacities. We found no association between climate and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence, or between economic indicators and in-hospital COVID-19 incidence or mortality rates. INTERPRETATION: This ecological study highlights the impact of the epidemic spread, national lockdown, and reactive adaptation of intensive care capacities on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. It provides information for future geo-epidemiological analyses and has implications for preparedness and response policies to current and future epidemic waves in France and elsewhere.

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Humans with viral respiratory infections, exposed to systemic NSAIDs. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Acute severe adverse outcomes, healthcare utilisation, quality of life and long-term survival. RESULTS: We screened 10 999 titles and abstracts and 738 full texts, including 87 studies. No studies addressed COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; none examined inpatient healthcare utilisation, quality of life or long-term survival. Effects of NSAIDs on mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with viral respiratory infections are unclear (three observational studies; very low certainty). Children with empyema and gastrointestinal bleeding may be more likely to have taken NSAIDs than children without these conditions (two observational studies; very low certainty). In patients aged 3 years and older with acute respiratory infections, ibuprofen is associated with a higher rate of reconsultations with general practitioners than paracetamol (one randomised controlled trial (RCT); low certainty). The difference in death from all causes and hospitalisation for renal failure and anaphylaxis between children with fever receiving ibuprofen versus paracetamol is likely to be less than 1 per 10 000 (1 RCT; moderate/high certainty). Twenty-eight studies in adults and 42 studies in children report adverse event counts. Most report that no severe adverse events occurred. Due to methodological limitations of adverse event counts, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear whether the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of severe adverse outcomes in patients with viral respiratory infections. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence for the absence of such risk. This is a rapid review with a number of limitations.

Several diagnostic methods are reported for detecting the coronavirus in clinical, research, and public health laboratories. Some tests detect the infection directly by detecting the viral RNA and other tests detect the infection indirectly by detecting the host antibodies. A diagnostic test during the pandemic should help make an appropriate clinical decision in a short period of time. Recently reported diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 have varying throughput, batching capacity, requirement of infrastructure setting, analytical performance, and turnaround times ranging from a few minutes to several hours. These factors should be considered while selecting a reliable and rapid diagnostic method to help make an appropriate decision and prompt public health interventions. This paper reviews recent SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods published in journals and reports released by regulatory agencies. We compared the analytical efficiency including limit of detection, sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. In addition, we also looked into ease of use, affordability, and availability of accessories. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the methods and provide our perspectives on priorities for future test development.","Giri, Basant; Pandey, Shishir; Shrestha, Retina; Pokharel, Krisha; Ligler, Frances S; Neupane, Bhanu B",Anal. bioanal. chem,602,26

There is a lot of evidence for the possible role of oxidative stress in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). In the current study, we aimed to measure the levels of glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) in the serum of patients with Covid-19. A total of 96 individuals with and without Covid-19 were enrolled and divided into four groups, including hospitalized group in non-intensive care units (non-ICU) (n=35), hospitalized group in intensive care units with endotracheal intubation (EI) (ICU with EI) (n=19), hospitalized group in intensive care units without endotracheal intubation (ICU without EI) (n=24), and healthy people without Covid-19 disease as our control group (n=18).The present study revealed that the TOS level was significantly lower in the group of control (P = 0.001), and level of (GSH) remarkably increased in the patients' groups (P < 0.001). TAC activity in non-ICU group of patients had no significant difference in comparison with control group. However, in hospitalized patients' groups in ICU with and without EI this activity was significantly different from control group (P<0.001). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the levels of TOS, GSH, and TAC with blood Oxygen saturation (SpO2), fever, duration of hospitalization, and the prognosis of this disease (P<0.001). Area under the curve (AUC) (CI, 95%) of TOS, TAC and GSH-C to predict death among patients were respectively 0.907 (0.841, 0.973), 0.735 (0.626, 0.843) and 0.820 (0.725, 0.914). ROC curve analysis showed that TOS, TAC and GSH-C have the potential specificity and sensitivity to distinguish between alive and dead patients. We found that elevated levels of oxidative stress and reduction of antioxidant indices can aggravate disease's severity in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Therefore, it can be suggested to apply antioxidant agents as one of the effective therapeutic strategies in these groups.","Karkhanei, Behrouz; Ghane, Elaheh Talebi; Mehri, Fereshteh",New Microbes New Infect,602,24

The outcomes were of 100% survival, and none of recipients developed COVID. One potential donor was asymptomatic positive for COVID, responded well to conservative treatment, and was later accepted as a donor. LT program during the COVID pandemic can successfully function after putting in place standard protocols for infection control. These can be implemented with minimal extra involvement of healthcare infrastructure, hence without diversion of resources from COVID management.

We describe 13 cases of nonhypercapnic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) of varied etiology, who were treated successfully in PP without the need for intubation. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula, supplementary oxygen with venturi face mask, or nasal cannula were used variedly in these patients. Mechanical ventilatory support is offered to patients with AHRF when other methods, such as NIV and oxygen via high-flow nasal cannula, fail. Invasive mechanical ventilation is fraught with complications which could be immediate, ranging from worsening of hypoxemia, worsening hemodynamics, loss of airway, and even death. Late complications could be ventilator-associated pneumonia, biotrauma, tracheal stenosis, etc. Prone position is known to improve oxygenation and outcome in adult respiratory distress syndrome. We postulated that positioning an unintubated patient with AHRF in PP will improve oxygenation and avoid the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and thereby its complications. Here, we describe a series of 13 patients with hypoxemic respiratory of varied etiology, who were successfully treated in the PP without endotracheal intubation. Two patients (15.4%) had mild, nine (69.2%) had moderate, and two (15.4%) had severe hypoxemia. Oxygenation as assessed by PaO2/FiO2 ratio in supine position was 154 ± 52, which improved to 328 ± 65 after PP. Alveolar to arterial (A-a) O2 gradient improved from a median of 170.5 mm Hg interquartile range (IQR) (127.8, 309.7) in supine position to 49.1 mm Hg IQR (45.0, 56.6) after PP. This improvement in oxygenation took a median of 46 hours, IQR (24, 109). Thus, voluntary PP maneuver improved oxygenation and avoided endotracheal intubation in a select group of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. This maneuver may be relevant in the ongoing novel coronavirus disease pandemic by potentially reducing endotracheal intubation and the need for ventilator and therefore better utilization of critical care services.

However, little is known about temporal aspects of SARS-CoV-2 intrahost diversity and the extent to which shared diversity reflects convergent evolution as opposed to transmission linkage. Here we use high depth of coverage sequencing to identify within-host genetic variants in 325 specimens from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and infected employees at a single medical center. We validated our variant calling by sequencing defined RNA mixtures and identified viral load as a critical factor in variant identification. By leveraging clinical metadata, we found that intrahost diversity is low and does not vary by time from symptom onset. This suggests that variants will only rarely rise to appreciable frequency prior to transmission. Although there was generally little shared variation across the sequenced cohort, we identified intrahost variants shared across individuals who were unlikely to be related by transmission. These variants did not precede a rise in frequency in global consensus genomes, suggesting that intrahost variants may have limited utility for predicting future lineages. These results provide important context for sequence-based inference in SARS-CoV-2 evolution and epidemiology.","Valesano, Andrew L; Rumfelt, Kalee E; Dimcheff, Derek E; Blair, Christopher N; Fitzsimmons, William J; Petrie, Joshua G; Martin, Emily T; Lauring, Adam S",PLoS Pathog,602,24

Moreover, it has become a global pandemic. This is of great value in describing the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients in detail and looking for markers which are significant to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study, 476 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from a consecutive series. After screening, a total of 395 patients were included in this study. All-cause death was the primary endpoint. All patients were followed up from admission till discharge or death. RESULTS: The main symptoms observed in the study included fever on admission, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The most common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Patients with lower CD4+T cell level were older and more often male compared to those with higher CD4+T cell level. Reduced CD8+T cell level was an indicator of the severity of COVID-19. Both decreased CD4+T [HR:13.659; 95%CI: 3.235-57.671] and CD8+T [HR: 10.883; 95%CI: 3.277-36.145] cell levels were associated with in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients, but only the decrease of CD4+T cell level was an independent predictor of in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets were common in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases of COVID-19. It was the CD8+T cell level, not the CD4+T cell level, that reflected the severity of the patient's disease. Only reduced CD4+T cell level was independently associated with increased in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Prognostic Factors of Patients With COVID-19, NCT04292964 .

There is situation where normality is being questioned in the post pandemic era. Many regulations such as Quarantine, self-isolation, social-distancing, and travel restrictions have been advised to prevent the spread of covid-19. After several months of quarantine, the world is now slowly pacing its way back to normality as the vaccine has been invented and brought into use.

We studied fatigue using neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations in post-COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Neuropsychological assessment included: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale, cognitive tests, and computerized tasks. Neurophysiological examination was assessed before (PRE) and 2 min after (POST) a 1-min fatiguing isometric pinching task and included: maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following ulnar nerve stimulation, resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and silent period (SP) duration in right FDI following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. Maximum pinch strength was measured. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg-Category-Ratio scale. Patients manifested fatigue, apathy, executive deficits, impaired cognitive control, and reduction in global cognition. Perceived exertion was higher in patients. CMAP and MEP were smaller in patients both PRE and POST. CMAP did not change in either group from PRE to POST, while MEP amplitudes declined in controls POST. SP duration did not differ between groups PRE, increased in controls but decreased in patients POST. Patients' change of SP duration from PRE to POST was negatively correlated to FSS. Abnormal SP shortening and lack of MEP depression concur with a reduction in post-exhaustion corticomotor inhibition, suggesting a possible GABAB-ergic dysfunction. This impairment might be related to the neuropsychological alterations. COVID-19-associated inflammation might lead to GABAergic impairment, possibly representing the basis of fatigue and explaining apathy and executive deficits.","Ortelli, Paola; Ferrazzoli, Davide; Sebastianelli, Luca; Engl, Michael; Romanello, Roberto; Nardone, Raffaele; Bonini, Ilenia; Koch, Giacomo; Saltuari, Leopold; Quartarone, Angelo; Oliviero, Antonio; Kofler, Markus; Versace, Viviana",J Neurol Sci,602,26

Neste contexto, objetivou-se avaliar a produção de forragem, a composição bromatológica e a ciclagem de nutrientes do capim-marandu consorciado ou não com o amendoim forrageiro. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o inteiramente ao acaso com medidas repetidas no tempo, considerando as estações do ano (outono, inverno, primavera e verão). A ciclagem de nutriente foi determinada em seis profundidades de solo (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 1520, 20-40 e 40-60 cm). O experimento foi realizado na Estação Experimental de Zootecnia do Extremo Sul da Bahia, da Comissão Executiva do Plano da Lavoura Cacaueira - CEPLAC, localizada em Itabela (16039S e 39030O), durante o período de março de 2013 a abril de 2014. Para a determinação da produção de forragem e dos constituintes bromatológicos foi realizada a cada 28 dias uma coleta em dupla amostragem da forragem presente em quadrado metálico com área de 1 m². O material coletado foi separado em material morto, material verde, folha, haste e planta inteira do amendoim. As amostras de raízes foram coletadas com um cubo de ferro (20x20x20 cm). As amostras de liteira foram coletadas em uma moldura de ferro de 20x20 cm. Após, todas as amostras foram pesadas, secas, moídas e enviadas ao laboratório. As características avaliadas foram: produção de forragem verde (PMV), produção de matéria seca (PMS), teores de matéria seca (MS), proteína bruta (PB), fibra em detergente neutro (FDN), fibra em detergente ácido (FDA) e isótopo Carbono-13. Também foi avaliada a ciclagem de nutrientes quanto ao seu teor de macro e micro nutrientes. Foi realizada a ANOVA e a comparação entre médias pelo teste de Tukey a 5% de probabilidade. Não houve efeito de interação entre os sistemas de manejo e as estações do ano (P>0,05), porém, houve efeito (P<0,05) entre os sistemas sobre a produção de forragem. As médias para PMV foram 17,75 e 25,21% para o consórcio e monocultivo respectivamente. Para a PMS as médias foram 33,88 e 35,89% para o consórcio e monocultivo respectivamente.

It is largely committed by male against their female intimate partner. This is often associated with the region's unique social and cultural norms which subordinate women throughout their lives. IPV is an ongoing concern in Bhutan. The country's age-old traditions and customs are closely related to culture of silence among women experiencing IPV. This study examined women's responses to intimate partner violence (IPV) in Bhutan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore sensitising concepts such as how and when women recognised IPV and how they responded to it. Fifteen women who had sought supportive services at the institution `RENEW' (Respect, Educate, Nurture, Empower Women) as a result of IPV participated in the interview. The Trans-theoretical model of behaviour change (TTM) was used as a theoretical framework to understand women's cognitive, affective and behavioural change processes. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify the patterns of women's responses. From the analysis, women's experiences of IPV and their responses were located within the four stages of change, including contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance. Women used nine traditional processes of change among which consciousness raising and helping relationships were critical and appeared across all four stages of change. This study provides important insights of Bhutanese women's cognitive and behavioural responses to IPV. The appearance of consciousness raising and helping relationships across all the stages of change represents a potential opportunity for intervention to initiate and promote changes in women's response to IPV in the early stages.","Choden, Phuntsho; Armstrong, Kerry; Sendall, Marguerite C",J Interpers Violence,602,29

Early cholecystectomy has many reported advantages. Operation-related morbidity and mortality have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, our aim is to present our general clinical approach to patients who were diagnosed with AC during the pandemic and our percutaneous cholecystostomy experience during this period. METHODS: This study included 72 patients who were presented to our hospital's emergency room between March 11 and May 31, 2020, with AC. Patients were divided into three groups based on their treatment: outpatients (Group 1), inpatients (Group 2) and patients undergoing percutaneous cholecystostomy (Group 3). These three groups were compared by their demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: There were 36 (50%) patients in Group 1, 25 (34.7%) patients in Group 2, and 11 (15.3%) patients in Group 3. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar. The CRP and WBC levels of the patients in Group 3 were significantly higher compared to the other groups. Moreover, the wall of the gallbladder was thicker and the size of the gallbladder was larger in Group 3. Patients had percutaneous cholecystostomy at the median of 3.5 days and the length of hospital stay was longer compared to Group 2 (3.9 days versus 9.2 days, p=0.00). The rate of re-hospitalization after discharge was similar in Group 2 and Group 3, but none of the patients in Group 1 required hospitalization. None of 72 patients developed an emergency condition requiring surgery, and there was no death. CONCLUSION: Although many publications emphasize that laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) can be performed with low morbidity at the first admission in acute cholecystitis, it is a clinical condition that can be delayed in the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar emergencies. Thus, percutaneous cholecystostomy should be effectively employed, and its indications should be extended if necessary (e.g., younger patients, patients with lower CCI or ASA). This approach may enable us to protect both patients and healthcare professionals that perform the operation from the risk of COVID-19.","Çiyiltepe, Hüseyin; Yildirim, Gülsah; Fersahoglu, Mehmet Mahir; Aydin, M Timuçin; Özcabi, Yetkin; Bulut, Nuriye Esen; Tasdelen, Iksan; Fersahoglu, Ayse Tuba; Yananli, Zühal Demirhan; Aydin, Ibrahim; Agca, Birol; Karakas, Hakki Muammer; Akyüz, Umit; Memisoglu, Kemal",Ulus Travma Acil Cerrahi Derg,602,20

Abnormal liver tests, mainly transaminase elevations, have been reported in hospitalized patients. We describe a syndrome of cholangiopathy in patients recovering from severe COVID-19 characterized by marked elevation in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) accompanied by evidence of bile duct injury on imaging. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to our institution from March 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020, on whom the hepatology service was consulted for abnormal liver tests. Bile duct injury was identified by abnormal liver tests with serum ALP > 3x upper limit of normal and abnormal findings on magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography. Clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological findings were recorded in a Research Electronic Data Capture database. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified, 11 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 58 years. Mean time from COVID-19 diagnosis to diagnosis of cholangiopathy was 118 days. Peak median serum alanine aminotransferase was 661 U/L and peak median serum ALP was 1855 U/L. Marked elevations of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers were common. Magnetic resonance cholangiopacreatography findings included beading of intrahepatic ducts (11/12, 92%), bile duct wall thickening with enhancement (7/12, 58%), and peribiliary diffusion high signal (10/12, 83%). Liver biopsy in 4 patients showed acute and/or chronic large duct obstruction without clear bile duct loss. Progressive biliary tract damage has been demonstrated radiographically. Five patients were referred for consideration of liver transplantation after experiencing persistent jaundice, hepatic insufficiency, and/or recurrent bacterial cholangitis.

This article aims to capture the ESG implementation practices and challenges of the financial investors and banks operating in the Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. By analyzing survey data of 37 financial market players, the results reveal that around 81% of the respondents already use ESG data when evaluating their investments, which can partly be explained by the regulatory drivers coming from the large share of private equity and venture funds managing local and international public funding. Moreover, a substantial average weight of 0.39 is found to be attributed to the sustainability factors in the investment evaluation process, which is rather high given the general perception of the ESG being a recent addition to the investment evaluation tools. While 51% of the respondents admitted that Covid-19 pandemic has made no changes in their ESG practices, there are other common challenges named by the investors e.g. lack of general and quantifiable ESG data from the side of the companies and struggles to find matching benchmarks for the large share of the small and midsized companies dominating the Baltic investment market. By addressing the obstacles highlighted by this research, the policy makers can explore the ways how to foster a wider adoption of ESG policies in the Baltic investment universe.","Zumente, I.; Bistrova, J.",Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues,602,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the prognosis of patients with lung cancer by delaying elective diagnostic procedures. A 66 year old man with past medical history of tobacco and polysubstance abuse initially presented to the emergency department with bilateral pedal edema. Chest imaging showed a right apical, spiculated cavitary mass. The patient missed his initial scheduled biopsy appointment and wanted to wait until pandemic subsided to reschedule. Ten weeks later, he presented to the hospital with rightsided sharp chest pain, associated with hemoptysis. CT-guided biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and the patient was initially planned to undergo surgical resection, however his functional status declined while pursuing pre-operative workup. He had progressive worsening hemoptysis, despite radiation treatment, requiring multiple transfusions of blood products. Interventional radiology performed bronchial artery embolization with interval improvement, however he progressed requiring endotracheal intubation with endobronchial blocker placement. Bleeding continued despite local treatment and family decided on palliative extubation. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to delayed diagnosis of lung cancer. Analysis of 20 institutions in the United States showed a 46.8% decrease in new lung cancer diagnoses in April 2020 versus April 20192. In Korea, three university hospitals found a significant increase in patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer compared to prior years3. UK Health Service data modeling predict 4.8-5.3% increased lung cancer related mortality from pandemic delayed diagnosis5. In our case, the diagnosis was delayed due to the patient's uncertainty about accessing the medical system during a pandemic. This is not uncommon-the pandemic has been cited as a reason for refusing breast lesion biopsy4. Clinicians need to be aware of this fear and make efforts to reassure patients of the additional safety protocols in place. The American College of Surgery recommends that procedures for high risk cancers, such as lung cancer, are high acuity on the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale and diagnosis and staging to start treatment not be delayed, if feasible, during the pandemic6,7. Lung cancer may be uniquely impacted by pandemic staffing shortages as pulmonologists are deployed to surging ICUs. Our patient delayed care during a surge and did not have a risk/benefit discussion with a clinician. This highlights the need to develop additional patient outreach systems to ensure timely access to care during a pandemic.","Gupta, P.; Acosta Sanchez, I.; Kovitz, K.

An updating article,17.972683,6.184749,2020,"BACKGROUND: Downloading a COVID-19 contact tracing app may be effective in reducing users' worry about COVID-19 and psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: This 2.5-month prospective study aimed to investigate the association of downloading a COVID-19 contact tracing app, the COVID-19 Contact Confirming Application (COCOA), released by the Japanese government, with worry about COVID-19 and psychological distress in a sample of employed adults in Japan. METHODS: A total of 996 full-time employed respondents to an online survey conducted May 22-26, 2020 (baseline), were invited to participate in a follow-up survey August 7-12, 2020 (follow-up). A high level of worrying about COVID-19 and high psychological distress were defined by baseline and follow-up scores on a single-item scale and the Kessler 6 (K6) scale, respectively. The app was released between the two surveys, on June 17. Participants were asked at follow-up if they downloaded the app. RESULTS: A total of 902 (90.6%) of 996 baseline participants responded to the follow-up survey. Among them, 184 (20.4%) reported that they downloaded the app. Downloading of the contact tracing app was significantly negatively associated with psychological distress at follow-up after controlling for baseline variables, but not with worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that using a government-issued COVID-19 contact tracing app may be beneficial for the mental health of employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kawakami, Norito; Sasaki, Natsu; Kuroda, Reiko; Tsuno, Kanami; Imamura, Kotaro",JMIR Ment Health,602,1

METHODS: This is an observational study of 921 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 respiratory infection to Hospital General Universitario Ciudad Real from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Following data were collected including patient demographic information, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapeutic interventions during the hospitalization and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 78years, and 59.2% of patients had a history of hypertension. Patients with previous treatment with RAS inhibitor (42.4%) showed lower risk of the primary composite endpoint (mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation). Treatment with RAS inhibitor (both outpatient treatment and during hospitalization) had neither effect on mortality nor need for invasive ventilation. There were no differences in time-to-event analysis between groups. CONCLUSIONS: RAS inhibitor treatment prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 respiratory infection was associated with lower risk of the primary composite endpoint and did not show neither impact on mortality nor need for invasive mechanical ventilation, even if these drugs were prescribed during hospitalization.","Martínez-Del Río, Jorge; Piqueras-Flores, Jesús; Nieto-Sandoval Martín de la Sierra, Patricia; Negreira-Caamaño, Martín; Águila-Gordo, Daniel; Mateo-Gómez, Cristina; Salas-Bravo, Daniel; Rodríguez-Martínez, Marta",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),602,21

METHODS: We conducted a quality-improvement initiative from May 28-June 25, 2020, during the first 4 weeks of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital labor and delivery unit. All consecutive patients presenting for delivery without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms were offered testing over four 1-week phases. Phase I documented the rate of testing uptake. Phase II recorded patients' reasons for declining testing. Phase III used phase II findings to create and implement shared decision-making tools. Phase IV offered each patient who declined nasopharyngeal testing an oropharyngeal alternative. The primary outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake by phase. RESULTS: Of 270 patients, 223 (83%) accepted testing and 47 (17%) declined. Maternal age and mode of delivery were similar between groups, whereas testing uptake was higher among nulliparous, White, Hispanic, or privately insured patients. There was a significant increase in the primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 testing across phases I-IV, from 68% to 76% to 94% to 95%, respectively (Somers' D 0.45; 95% CI of association 0.30-0.59). The most commonly cited reason for declining testing was concern regarding testing discomfort. In subgroup analyses by race and insurance type, there was a significant increase in testing uptake across phases I-IV for Black patients (56%, 54%, 91%, 92%; Somers' D 0.36; 95% CI of association 0.28-0.64), White patients (76%, 93%, 96%, 100%; Somers' D 0.59; 95% CI of association 0.38-0.8), those with Medicaid insurance (60%, 64%, 88%, 92%; 95%; Somers' D 0.39; CI of association 0.22 to 0.56), and those with private insurance (77%, 96%, 97%, 100%; Somers' D 0.63; 95% CI of association 0.40-0.86). CONCLUSION: Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake significantly increased through a rapid-cycle improvement initiative.

Few scientific studies have investigated hospital costs and stays of patients at the end of life, and even fewer studies have analysed their evolution over time. In this paper, we exploit hospitalisation data for the Lombardy region of Italy with the aim of studying the evolution of hospital casemix, costs and stays of chronic patients, and compare the last year of life of two cohorts of patients who died in 2005 and 2014. Despite an overall three-year increase in the age at death, the results showed a significant decrease in hospital costs and use due to reduced interventions and length of hospital stays. However, this was not associated with an increase in quality of life/conditions (as indicated by clinical casemix as a proxy) for end-of-life patients; patients' casemix characteristics and clinical condition, as measured by the number of comorbidities, disease severity, prevalence of pulmonary disease and heart failure diagnosis, significantly worsened over the decade.

Classical compartmental models are useful, however, likely oversimplify the complexity when studying epidemics. This study aimed to develop a multi-regional, hierarchical-tier mathematical model for better understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of COVID-19 spread and control. By incorporating the epidemiological and population flow data, we have successfully constructed a multi-regional, hierarchical-tier SLIHR model. With this model, we revealed insight into how COVID-19 was spread from the epicentre Wuhan to other regions in Mainland China based on the large population flow network data. By comprehensive analysis of the effects of different control measures, we identified that Level 1 emergency response, community prevention and application of big data tools significantly correlate with the effectiveness of local epidemic containment across different provinces of China outside the epicentre. In conclusion, our multi-regional, hierarchical-tier SLIHR model revealed insight into how COVID-19 spread from the epicentre Wuhan to other regions of China, and the subsequent control of local epidemics.

Budgetary constraints impede the regular delivery of public services, especially in developing countries. Energy efficiency and sustainable economic growth in Croatia can be improved with public-partnership models providing public services. However, this concept is often considered as not appropriate due to many misconceptions in public opinion. We analysed a survey of almost 1500 Croatian students with the aim of verifying the importance of formal education in the recognition of realistic aspects of PPP among the population, which represents important social capital. In comparison to other students, students who have been taught about public-private partnership models at university are more likely to recognise certain misconceptions about public-private partnerships and are more likely to think that it is possible to successfully implement such projects in Croatia. Compared with others, students in the field of energy have shown a greater tendency to apply models of public-private partnership in the energy sector, even though these concern the exploitation of natural resources where there is a traditional tendency to protect the autonomy of public governance. Compared to their male colleagues, female students are more prone to misconceptions about PPPs and are less supportive of private management of public infrastructure.","Bogovac, Jasna Dodig Domagoj Lugarić Tereza Rogić",Energies,602,16

There may be needs specific to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations in these circumstances that remain thus far unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with dementia and their family carers of BAME backgrounds, in relation to their experiences of community dementia care and the impact on their daily lives. DESIGN: 15 participants (persons with dementia and carers) were recruited for semistructured qualitative interviews. Respondents were of South Asian and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds. We used thematic analysis to analyse our data from a constructivist perspective, which emphasises the importance of multiple perspectives, contexts and values. RESULTS: There were a number of ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted BAME persons with dementia and carers with regard to their experiences of dementia community care and the impact on their everyday lives. In particular we identified eight key themes, with subthemes: fear and anxiety, food and eating (encompassing food shopping and eating patterns), isolation and identity, community and social relationships, adapting to COVID-19, social isolation and support structures, and medical interactions. Fear and anxiety formed an overarching theme that encompassed all others. DISCUSSION: This paper covers unique and underexplored topics in a COVID-19-vulnerable group. There is limited work with these groups in the UK and this is especially true in COVID-19. The results showed that such impacts were far-reaching and affected not only day-to-day concerns, but also care decisions with long-ranging consequences, and existential interests around fear, faith, death and identity.","West, Emily; Nair, Pushpa; Barrado-Martin, Yolanda; Walters, Kate R; Kupeli, Nuriye; Sampson, Elizabeth L; Davies, Nathan",BMJ Open,602,1

The epithelial cells form a tight barrier and secrete proteins that are major components of the mucosal immune response. Functional in vitro models of the human lung are essential for screening the epithelial response and assessing the toxicity and barrier crossing of drugs, inhaled particles, and pollutants. However, there is a lack of models to investigate the effect of chronic exposure without resorting to animal testing. Here, we developed a 3D model of the human bronchial epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and demonstrated its viability and functionality for 21 days without subculturing. We investigated the effect of reduced Fetal Bovine Serum supplementation in the basal medium and defined the minimal supplementation needed to maintain a functional epithelium, so that the amount of exogenous serum proteins could be reduced during drug testing. The long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome was fully characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry in two preclinical models using Calu-3 or primary NHBE cells. 408 common secreted proteins were identified while significant differences in protein abundance were observed with time, suggesting that 7-10 days are necessary to establish a mature secretome in the Calu-3 model. The associated Reactome pathways highlight the role of the secreted proteins in the immune response of the bronchial epithelium. We suggest this preclinical 3D model can be used to evaluate the long-term toxicity of drugs or particles on the human bronchial epithelium, and subsequently to investigate their effect on the epithelial cell secretions.","Sanchez-Guzman, Daniel; Boland, Sonja; Brookes, Oliver; Mc Cord, Claire; Lai Kuen, René; Sirri, Valentina; Baeza Squiban, Armelle; Devineau, Stéphanie",Sci Rep,602,1

This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Internet use and related risk factors among the general public in China. METHODS: A large-sample cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 24 to April 30, 2020, in China, and 20,472 participants completed the survey. We investigated the prevalence and severity of Internet addiction based on the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and explored the risk factors related to increases in time spent on Internet use and severity of Internet addiction, as well as severe Internet addiction. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Internet addiction was 36.7% among the general population during the pandemic, and that of severe Internet addiction was 2.8%, according to IAT scores. Time spent on recreational Internet use had significantly increased during the pandemic, and almost half of participants reported increases in the severity of Internet addiction. Risk factors for increases in time spent on Internet use and severity of Internet addiction and severe Internet addiction included having fewer social supporters, perceiving pressure and impact on mental health status due to COVID-19, and being over-engaged in playing videogames.

Health systems worldwide have moved quickly to implement telemedicine in diverse settings to reduce infection, but little is understood about how best to connect acutely ill patients with nearby clinical team members, even in the next room. OBJECTIVE: To inform these efforts, this paper provides an early example of inpatient telemedicine implementation and its perceived acceptability and effectiveness. METHODS: Using purposive sampling, this study conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with nurses (n=5) and attending (n=5) and resident (n=15) physicians on a single COVID-19 unit within Stanford Health Care to evaluate implementation outcomes and perceived effectiveness of inpatient telemedicine. Semi-structured interview protocols and qualitative analysis were framed around the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework and identified key themes using a rapid analytic process and consensus approach. RESULTS: All clinical team members reported wide reach of inpatient telemedicine, with some use for almost all COVID-19 patients. Inpatient telemedicine was perceived to be effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and personal protective equipment (PPE) use without significantly compromising quality of care. Physician workflows remained relatively stable as most standard clinical activities were conducted via telemedicine following the initial intake examination, though resident physicians reported reduced educational opportunities given limited opportunities to conduct physical exams. Nurse workflows required significant adaptations to cover non-nursing duties such as food delivery and facilitating technology connections for patients and physicians alike. Perceived patient impact included consistent care quality, with some considerations around privacy. Reported challenges included: patient-clinical team communication and personal connection with the patient, perceptions of patient isolation, ongoing technical challenges, and certain aspects of the physical exam. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical team members reported inpatient telemedicine encounters as acceptable and effective in reducing COVID-19 exposure and PPE use. Nurses adapted their workflows more than physicians to implement the new technology and bore a higher burden of in-person care and technical support. Recommendations for improved inpatient telemedicine use include information technology (IT) support and training, increased technical functionality, and remote access for the clinical team.","Safaeinili, Nadia; Vilendrer, Stacie; Williamson, Emma; Zhao, Zicheng; Brown-Johnson, Cati; Asch, Steven M; Shieh, Lisa",,602,1

We propose and compare multiple time-series prediction techniques which incorporate auxiliary variables. One type of approach is based on spatio-temporal graph neural networks which forecast the pandemic course by utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture and human mobility data. Nodes in this graph represent the state-level deaths due to COVID-19, edges represent the human mobility trend and temporal edges correspond to node attributes across time. The second approach is based on a statistical technique for COVID-19 mortality prediction in the United States that uses the SARIMA model and eXogenous variables. We evaluate these techniques on both state and national levels COVID-19 data in the United States and claim that the SARIMA and MCP models generated forecast values by the eXogenous variables can enrich the underlying model to capture complexity in respectively national and state levels data. We demonstrate significant enhancement in the forecasting accuracy for a COVID-19 dataset, with a maximum improvement in forecasting accuracy by 64.58% and 59.18% (on average) over the GCN-LSTM model in the national level data, and 58.79% and 52.40% (on average) over the GCN-LSTM model in the state level data.

Diabetes is an established risk associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with COVID-19 has not been reported yet. METHODS: In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The clinical features, treatment strategies and prognosis data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was followed up until March 12, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%).

We aimed to describe the association of COVID-19 and T-wave inversion (TWI) in a large case series. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of confirmed COVID-19 cases with at least one electrocardiogram (ECG) in a large hospital in New York City (March 23, 2020-April 23, 2020). Patients with new TWI or pseudonormalization were further analyzed. Mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation were the main outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 3225 patients were screened; 195 (6%) were selected for further analysis: 181 with TWI and 14 with T-wave pseudonormalization. Mean age was 66 ± 7 years; 51% were male. TWI were more commonly noted in the lateral (71%), followed by anterior (64%), inferior (57%), and septal (26%) leads. A total of 44 patients (23%) had elevated troponin. A total of 50 patients died (26%). Mortality rates of 35%, and 52% were observed in patients with diffuse TWI, and elevated troponin, respectively. Mortality rate of 80% was observed in patients with both elevated troponin and diffuse TWI. Additionally, 30% of the entire cohort and 58% of patients with elevated troponin required invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that new TWI is a relatively common finding in COVID-19 patients.

Even mild insufficiencies of Zn cause alterations in haematopoiesis and immune functions, resulting in a proinflammatory phenotype and a disturbed redox metabolism. Although immune system malfunction has the most obvious effect, the functions of several tissue cell types are disturbed if Zn supply is limiting. Adhesion molecules and tight junction proteins decrease, while cell death increases, generating barrier dysfunction and possibly organ failure. Taken together, Zn deficiency both weakens the resistance of the human body towards pathogens and at the same time increases the danger of an overactive immune response that may cause tissue damage. The case numbers of Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) are still increasing, which is causing enormous problems for health systems and economies. There is an urgent need to reduce both the number of severe cases and the resulting deaths. While therapeutic options are still under investigation, and first vaccines have been approved, cost-effective ways to reduce the likelihood of or even prevent infection, and the transition from mild symptoms to more serious detrimental disease, are highly desirable. Nutritional supplementation might be an effective option to achieve these aims.

Concomitant liver disease could increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, and chronic liver disease patients sometimes require frequent admission and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thus, clarifying the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 in outpatients with liver disease is essential for preventing nosocomial infections. We aimed to clarify the time-dependent changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence in liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, in an area of Japan experiencing a second wave of COVID-19. METHODS: We included the preserved sera of 100, 300, and 300 consecutive liver disease outpatients, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, from May 2019, March 2020, and May 2020, respectively. The sera were analyzed immunochromatographically to detect immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (KURABO) and by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2-assay (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: Analysis of 100 cases from May 2019, before COVID-19 became pandemic, revealed that the specificity of immunochromatographic tests and Elecsys were 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93-99.8%) and 100% (95% CI, 97-100%), respectively. Analysis of 300 cases from March 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0.3% (1/300; 95% CI, 0-1.8%) for COVID-19 by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Analysis of 300 cases from May 2020 revealed a seroprevalence of 0% (0/300; 95% CI, 0-1.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay has high specificity. The cumulative seroprevalence of COVID-19 by the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay in outpatients with liver disease in Sapporo, who were asymptomatic for COVID-19, was 0.17% (1/600; 95% CI, 0.0-0.9%) until May 2020.","Suda, Goki; Ogawa, Koji; Kimura, Megumi; Maehara, Osamu; Kitagataya, Takashi; Ohara, Masatsugu; Tokuchi, Yoshimasa; Kubo, Akinori; Yamada, Ren; Shigesawa, Taku; Suzuki, Kazuharu; Kawagishi, Naoki; Nakai, Masato; Sho, Takuya; Natsuizaka, Mitsuteru; Morikawa, Kenichi; Sakamoto, Naoya",Hepatol. res,602,10

Its most common form, chronic plaque or psoriasis vulgaris, is a consequence of genetic susceptibility, particularly in the presence of the HLA-C*06:02 risk allele, and of environmental triggers such as streptococcal infection, stress, smoking, obesity, and alcohol consumption. There are several phenotypes and research has separated pustular from chronic plaque forms. Immunological and genetic studies have identified IL-17 and IL-23 as key drivers of psoriasis pathogenesis. Immune targeting of these cytokines and of TNF&#945; by biological therapies has revolutionised the care of severe chronic plaque disease.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed extensive intrahepatic duct dilatation with 'beading' but common bile duct sparing. Given the patient had no primary liver disease prior to admission, we considered secondary causes of cholestatic liver injury; this led us to an unusual diagnosis of secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients.

To do this, our approach repeatedly makes use of a heuristic for optimisation to efficiently find the best combination of the hyperparameters of a convolutional deep learning model. The framework starts with optimising a basic convolutional neural network which represents the starting point for the evolution process. Subsequently, at most two additional convolutional layers are added, at a time, to the previous convolutional structure as a result of a further optimisation phase. Each performed phase maximises the the accuracy of the system, thus requiring training and assessment of the new model, which gets gradually deeper, with relevant COVID-19 chest X-ray images. This iterative process ends when no improvement, in terms of accuracy, is recorded. Hence, the proposed method evolves the most performing network with the minimum number of convolutional layers. In this light, we simultaneously achieve high accuracy while minimising the presence of redundant layers to guarantee a fast but reliable model. Our results show that the proposed implementation of such a framework achieves accuracy up to 99.11%, thus being particularly suitable for the early detection of COVID-19.","Khishe, Mohammad Caraffini Fabio Kuhn Stefan",Mathematics,602,16

However, with more than 2 billion vaccination doses administered to date, reports of rare adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are beginning to emerge. In late February 2021, atypical thrombotic events following immunization with the adenoviral vector-based ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine were first reported, and similar events have also been observed in recipients of the adenoviral vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and the mRNA-based BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines. These manifestations of atypical thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 vaccine immunization are now collectively referred to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Although the reported incidence remains very low and does not affect the overall benefit of immunization, it is also true that if left untreated, VITT can be debilitating or even fatal. Therefore, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview regarding the incidence, pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of VITT, as well as considerations for special populations, based on the currently available evidence in the literature. It is hoped that this will enhance awareness of this vaccine side effect, so that cases of VITT may be identified and treated in a timely and appropriate manner.","Chen, P. W.; Tsai, Z. Y.; Chao, T.

Herein, an efficient HER electrocatalyst based on flowerlike S-doped Ni2P mesoporous nanosheets supported on nickel foam (S-Ni2P NSs/NF) was developed through an effective approach. The obtained S-Ni2P NSs/NF catalyst required low overpotential of only 87.5 mV and 179.1 mV to reach current density of 10 and 50 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, a small Tafel slope of 62.1 mV dec-1 for S-Ni2P NSs/NF demonstrated that HER process occurred with very fast kinetics. Besides high HER activity, the synthesized S-Ni2P NSs/NF catalyst exhibited superior stability and long-term durability toward HER, which had ability to operate over 30 h without degradation in catalytic performance. The unique flower-like nanosheets structure with excellent mesoporous characteristics of S-Ni2P NSs/NF resulted in maximizing electrochemical active surface area for providing a large number of electrocatalytic active sites. In addition, S doping effect could modulate electronic structure of Ni species in Ni2P, leading to accelerating rate adsorption of reaction intermediates on the surface of catalysts toward improving HER kinetics. The results not only demonstrate S-Ni2P NSs/NF as active catalyst for HER, but also offer effective strategy for improving catalytic activity of earth-abundant transition metal-based HER catalysts.","L L, D Thi; Tuyen, P N K; Vu, Thien Y",,602,16

Although pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a variety of cardiovascular complications have been reported. An integrated diagnostic algorithm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with suspected cardiac involvement (laboratory findings of myocardial injury and electrocardiographic changes) may help to avoid unnecessary examinations and minimize the risk of operator infection. Due to its mobility and bedside feasibility, echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in this clinical setting. It quickly provides information on ventricular functions, pulmonary hypertension, valve disease and pericardial effusion. In case of ST-segment elevation (STE), urgent coronary angiography should be performed. Cardiac ultrasound helps distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial disease and may detect pericardial disease. Transmural ischemic electrocardiographic changes, with or without early elevated troponin levels or echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, will determine the need for early invasive coronary angiography. Computed tomography (CT) through its multiple applications (chest CT; CT pulmonary angiography and coronary CT angiography; late iodine enhancement CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance might be helpful in reinforcing or redirecting diagnostic hypothesis emerged by other clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The current pandemic makes it challenging to perform serial invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing in COVID-19 patients and high serum troponin level. Nevertheless, thoughtful and systematic use of an appropriate multimodality imaging strategy is clinically relevant to detect cardiac injury and distinguish myocardial infarction from, myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome and pulmonary embolism.","Citro, Rodolfo; Pontone, Gianluca; Bellino, Michele; Silverio, Angelo; Iuliano, Giuseppe; Baggiano, Andrea; Manka, Robert; Iesu, Severino; Vecchione, Carmine; Asch, Federico Miguel; Ghadri, Jelena Rima; Templin, Christian",Trends cardiovasc. med,602,12

We examined the latent structure of stress and adversity related to the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women, potential antecedents of COVID-19-related stress and adversity in this population, and associations with prenatal depressive symptoms. METHOD: We surveyed 725 pregnant women residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in March-May 2020, 343 of whom provided addresses that were geocoded and matched by census tract to measures of community-level risk. We compared their self-reported depressive symptoms to women matched on demographic factors and history of mental health difficulties who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: Women who were pregnant during the pandemic were nearly twice as likely to have possible depression than were matched women who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Individual- and community-level factors tied to socioeconomic inequality were associated with latent factors of COVID-19-related stress and adversity. Beyond objective adversity, subjective stress responses were strongly associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Highlighting the role of subjective responses in vulnerability to prenatal depression and factors that influence susceptibility to COVID-19-related stress, these findings inform the allocation of resources to support recovery from this pandemic and future disease outbreaks. In addition to policies that mitigate disruptions to the environment due to the pandemic, treatments that focus on cognitions about the self and the environment may help to alleviate depressive symptoms in pregnant women.","King, Lucy S; Feddoes, Daisy E; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S; Humphreys, Kathryn L; Gotlib, Ian H",Psychol Med,602,1

We hypothesized that using a 200 m fast walking test (200 mFWT) and telerehabilitation would create an effective alternative cardiac rehabilitation (CR) intervention that could improve cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants (n = 19, mean age 60.4 ± 9.6) of the 8-week intervention performed regular physical exercise at the target heart rate zone determined by calculations based on the 200 mFWT results. In our study, the participants were supervised using telerehabilitation. A total of 84% of participants completed the 8-week intervention. No adverse events were reported during telerehabilitation. The study participants noted a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in cardiorespiratory fitness expressed by an 8% reduction in the walking test time (&#916; 8.8 ± 5.9 s). Home-based telerehabilitation based on 200 mFWT effectively increased the cardiorespiratory fitness in people with CHD with a low to moderate cardiovascular risk. This was a novel approach in CR during the COVID-19 pandemic. As research in this area is justified, this paper may serve as an alternative method of providing healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and as a basis for further upcoming randomized controlled trials.","Batalik, Ladislav; Konecny, Vladimir; Dosbaba, Filip; Vlazna, Daniela; Brat, Kristian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),602,25

Particularly on the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, biological sequence data play an important role in detecting diseases, analyzing the mechanism and discovering specific drugs. In recent years, pretraining models that have emerged in natural language processing have attracted widespread attention in many research fields not only to decrease training cost but also to improve performance on downstream tasks. Pretraining models are used for embedding biological sequence and extracting feature from large biological sequence corpus to comprehensively understand the biological sequence data. In this survey, we provide a broad review on pretraining models for biological sequence data. Moreover, we first introduce biological sequences and corresponding datasets, including brief description and accessible link. Subsequently, we systematically summarize popular pretraining models for biological sequences based on four categories: CNN, word2vec, LSTM and Transformer. Then, we present some applications with proposed pretraining models on downstream tasks to explain the role of pretraining models. Next, we provide a novel pretraining scheme for protein sequences and a multitask benchmark for protein pretraining models. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in pretraining models for biological sequences.","Song, Bosheng; Li, Zimeng; Lin, Xuan; Wang, Jianmin; Wang, Tian; Fu, Xiangzheng",Brief Funct Genomics,602,33

At the same time, several high throughput screenings of drugs have been reported to inhibit the viral components during the early course of infection but with little proven efficacies. Here, we investigate the drug repurposing strategies to counteract the coronavirus infection which involves several potential targetable host proteins involved in viral replication and disease progression. We report the high throughput analysis of literature-derived repurposing drug candidates that can be used to target the genetic regulators known to interact with viral proteins based on experimental and interactome studies. In this work we have performed integrated molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations through an expedite in silico process where the number of screened candidates reduces sequentially at every step based on physicochemical interactions. We elucidate that in addition to the pre-clinical and FDA approved drugs that targets specific regulatory proteins, a range of chemical compounds (Nafamostat, Chloramphenicol, Ponatinib) binds to the other gene transcription and translation regulatory proteins with higher affinity and may harbour potential for therapeutic uses. There is a rapid growing interest in the development of combination therapy for COVID-19 to target multiple enzymes/pathways. Our in silico approach would be useful in generating leads for experimental screening for rapid drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 interacting host proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Methods: Two hundred seventy COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed, including 146 males and 124 females, with median age of 51 (9,89). The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 270 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. Results: 264 cases (95.74%) were positive at the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (2.22%) were negative, after multiple inspections, 270 cases (100%) were positive. According to the number of lung segments involved in the lesion, the lesions range from &lt;30% of the lung area (Common type), 30–50% (Severe type), and&gt; 50% (Critical type). At the first CT exam, 136 cases (50.37%) of the common type, 89 cases (32.96%) of the severe type and 45 cases (16.67%) of the critical type. At the second CT exam, 84 cases (31.11%) of the common type, 103 cases (38.15%) of the severe type and 83 cases (30.74%) of the critical type. In the third CT exam, there were 151 cases (55.93%) of the common type, 86 cases (31.85%) of the severe type and 33 cases (12.22%) of the critical type. The differences in image typing were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. Conclusion: In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.","Lu, Xuefang; Gong, Wei; Peng, Zhoufeng; Zeng, Feifei; Liu, Fang",Front.

From a total of 14 MSI-H metastatic prostate cancer patients at participating centers, nine patients with mCRPC with 56% bone, 33% nodal, 11% liver and 11% soft-tissue metastases and a median PSA of 29.3 ng/dL, were treated with pembrolizumab after 2 lines of therapy for CRPC. The estimated median time on pembrolizumab was 9.9 (95% CI 1.0 to 18.8) months. Four patients (44%) achieved PSA50 after a median of 4 (3-12) weeks after treatment initiation including three patients with >99% PSA decline. Among the patients evaluable for radiographic response (n=5), the response rate was 60% with one complete response and two partial responses. Best response was observed after a median of 3.3 (1.4-7.6) months. At time of cut-off, four patients were still on pembrolizumab while four patients discontinued therapy due to progressive disease and one due to COVID-19 infection. Half of the patients with PSA50 had both MSI-H and pathogenic alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in their G360 assays. The use of liquid biopsy to identify metastatic prostate cancer patients with MSI-H is feasible in clinical practice and may overcome some of the obstacles associated with prostate cancer tumor tissue testing. The robust activity of pembrolizumab in selected patients supports the generalized testing for MSI-H.","Barata, Pedro; Agarwal, Neeraj; Nussenzveig, Roberto; Gerendash, Benjamin; Jaeger, Ellen; Hatton, Whitley; Ledet, Elisa; Lewis, Brian; Layton, Jodi; Babiker, Hani; Bryce, Alan; Garje, Rohan; Stein, Cy; Kiedrowski, Lesli; Saylor, Philip; Sartor, Oliver",J. immunotherap. cancer,602,20

More than 216 countries are struggling against the transmission of the disease, recovery and motility. Till date more than 0.948 million deaths out of 30.369 million confirmed cases are reported by WHO. Most of the nations adopted partial or complete 'lockdown' and imposed 'social distancing' to control the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and its consequence. Though global economic growth declined due to nationwide lockdown, there are certain positive impacts on environment. This review article has discussed the effects of nationwide lockdown aiming to community transmission COVID-19 on animal life behaviour and atmospheric environment in different aspects. In the lockdown period, the levels of NO2 and carbon emission remarkably decrease in atmosphere due to restricted consumption of fossil fuel by industries, thermal power stations and air transportations. The concentration of NO2 dropped by 45-54% in the atmosphere of most populated cities in Europe. The intensities of particulate matters PM2.5 and PM10 decreased by 43% and 31% respectively, at lower atmosphere indicating improvement in air qualities in different parts of world caused by less traffic and construction activities. SPM reduced up to 15.9%, showing improvement in surface water quality. New deserted bank has developed due to less river activities in this period. Noise pollution remarkably dropped below 60 db even in crowded cities. Thus, the atmospheric environment has resumed some extent in all respect by means of such global-wide lockdown aiming to control COVID-19 pandemic. The behavioural changes of wild animals, birds, butterfly, pets and street animals that reflected on ecosystem of their relative region indicate the non-interference of human activities on lives of natural creatures during lockdown period. There is certain correlation between atmospheric change with the behavioural changes of natural creature during lockdown period. The objective of this study is to focus the critical analysis of the effect of human activities on atmospheric environment for sustainable ecosystem in long term. Significantly, there is ample scope of research on sustainable development of atmospheric environment and ecosystem of creature in absence of human being.","Bar, Harekrishna",Environ Dev Sustain,602,21

Some guidelines have already been published for urogynecology; however, no specific documents have been produced on physiotherapy in urogynecology. This article aimed to offer guidance regarding physiotherapy in urogynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A group of experts in physiotherapy in women's health performed a literature search in the Pubmed, PEDro, Web of Science and Embase databases and proposed a clinical guideline for physiotherapy management of urogynecological disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. This document was reviewed by other physiotherapists and a multidisciplinary panel, which analyzed the suggested topics and reached consensus. The recommendations were grouped according to their similarities and allocated into categories. RESULTS: Four categories of recommendations (ethics and regulation issues, assessment of pelvic floor muscle function and dysfunction, health education and return to in-person care) were proposed. Telephysiotherapy and situations that need in-person care were also discussed. Regionalization is another topic that was considered. CONCLUSION: This study provides some guidance for continuity of the physiotherapist's work in urogynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering the World Health Organization recommendations and the epidemiological public health situation of each region. Telephysiotherapy can also be used to provide continuity of the care in this area during the COVID-19 pandemic, opening new perspectives for physiotherapy in urogynecology.","Ferreira, Cristine Homsi Jorge; Driusso, Patricia; Haddad, Jorge Milhem; Pereira, Simone Botelho; Fernandes, Ana Carolina Nociti Lopes; Porto, Debora; Reis, Bianca Manzan; Mascarenhas, Lilian Rose; Brito, Luiz Gustavo Oliveira; Ferreira, Elizabeth Alves Gonçalves",Int. urogynecol. j.

However, most HIV-positive persons initiate ART when their CD4 count decreases below 500 × 109 cells/L. Consequences of delayed ART on risk for non-AIDS-defining and AIDS-defining cancer, one of the most common reasons for death in HIV, are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term risk difference for cancer with the immediate ART strategy. DESIGN: Multinational prospective cohort study. SETTING: The D:A:D (Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV Drugs) study, which included HIV-positive persons from Europe, Australia, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 8318 HIV-positive persons with at least 1 measurement each of CD4 cell count and viral load while ART-naive (study period, 2006 to 2016). MEASUREMENTS: The parametric g-formula was used, with adjustment for baseline and time-dependent confounders (CD4 cell count and viral load), to assess the 10-year risk for non-AIDS-defining and AIDS-defining cancer of immediate versus deferred (at CD4 counts <350 and <500 × 109 cells/L) ART initiation strategies. RESULTS: During 64 021 person-years of follow-up, 231 cases of non-AIDS-defining cancer and 272 of AIDS-defining cancer occurred among HIV-positive persons with a median age of 36 years (interquartile range, 29 to 43 years). With immediate ART, the 10-year risk for non-AIDS-defining cancer was 2.97% (95% CI, 2.37% to 3.50%) and that for AIDS-defining cancer was 2.50% (CI, 2.37% to 3.38%). Compared with immediate ART initiation, the 10-year absolute risk differences when deferring ART to CD4 counts less than 500 × 109 cells/L and less than 350 × 109 cells/L were 0.12 percentage point (CI, -0.01 to 0.26 percentage point) and 0.29 percentage point (CI, -0.03 to 0.73 percentage point), respectively, for non-AIDS-defining cancer and 0.32 percentage point (CI, 0.21 to 0.44 percentage point) and 1.00 percentage point (CI, 0.67 to 1.44 percentage points), respectively, for AIDS-defining cancer. LIMITATION: Potential residual confounding due to observational study design. CONCLUSION: In this young cohort, effects of immediate ART on 10-year risk for cancer were small, and further supportive data are needed for non-AIDS-defining cancer.

Elective surgical cases have been largely postponed, and surgery departments are struggling to correctly and equitably determine which cases need to proceed. A resource to objectively prioritize and track time sensitive cases would be useful as an adjunct to clinical decision-making. METHODS: A multidisciplinary working group at Emory Healthcare developed and implemented an adjudication tool for the prioritization of time sensitive surgeries. The variables identified by the team to form the construct focused on the patient's survivability according to actuarial data, potential impact on function with delay in care, and high-level biology of disease. Implementation of the prioritization was accomplished with a database design to streamline needed communication between surgeons and surgical adjudicators. All patients who underwent time sensitive surgery between 4/10/20 and 6/15/20 across 5 campuses were included. RESULTS: The primary outcomes of interest were calculated patient prioritization score and number of days until operation. 1767 cases were adjudicated during the specified time period. The distribution of prioritization scores was normal, such that real-time adjustment of the empiric algorithm was not required. On retrospective review, as the patient prioritization score increased, the number of days to the operating room decreased. This confirmed the functionality of the tool and provided a framework for organization across multiple campuses. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an in-house adjudication tool to aid in the prioritization of a large cohort of canceled and time sensitive surgeries. The tool is relatively simple in its design, reproducible, and data driven which allows for an objective adjunct to clinical decision-making. The database design was instrumental in communication optimization during this chaotic period for patients and surgeons.","Davis, S Scott; Williford, Michael L; Isenburg, Scott; Klopman, Matthew; Sweeney, John F; Boden, Scott D",Surg. endosc,602,20

We further calculated the time of peak infectivity and quantified the proportion of secondary infections during the incubation period.ResultsThe median incubation period was 7.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.9â7.5) days. The median serial and generation intervals were similar, 4.7 (95% CI: 4.2â5.3) and 4.6 (95% CI: 4.2â5.1) days, respectively. Paediatric cases < 18 years had a longer incubation period than adult age groups (p = 0.007). The median incubation period increased from 4.4 days before 25 January to 11.5 days after 31 January (p < 0.001), whereas the median serial (generation) interval contracted from 5.9 (4.8) days before 25 January to 3.4 (3.7) days after. The median time from symptom onset to discharge was also shortened from 18.3 before 22 January to 14.1 days after. Peak infectivity occurred 1 day before symptom onset on average, and the incubation period accounted for 70% of transmission.ConclusionThe high infectivity during the incubation period led to short generation and serial intervals, necessitating aggressive control measures such as early case finding and quarantine of close contacts.","Lu, Qing-Bin; Zhang, Yong; Liu, Ming-Jin; Zhang, Hai-Yang; Jalali, Neda; Zhang, An-Ran; Li, Jia-Chen; Zhao, Han; Song, Qian-Qian; Zhao, Tian-Shuo; Zhao, Jing; Liu, Han-Yu; Du, Juan; Teng, Ai-Ying; Zhou, Zi-Wei; Zhou, Shi-Xia; Che, Tian-Le; Wang, Tao; Yang, Tong; Guan, Xiu-Gang; Peng, Xue-Fang; Wang, Yu-Na; Zhang, Yuan-Yuan; Lv, Shou-Ming; Liu, Bao-Cheng; Shi, Wen-Qiang; Zhang, Xiao-Ai; Duan, Xiao-Gang; Liu, Wei; Yang, Yang; Fang, Li-Qun",Euro surveill,602,10

Whether its cardiac involvement is a specific feature consisting of myocarditis, or simply due to microvascular injury and systemic inflammation, is yet unclear and presently debated. Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID-19 and other causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID-19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy). When compared to the non-COVID-19, mortality (COVID-19 = 38.2% vs. non-COVID-19 = 51.3%, P = 0.142) and impairment of systolic function were not significantly different. Surprisingly, myocardial injury was even more frequent in non-COVID-19 (96.4% vs. 78.1% P = 0.004). Although inflammatory activity [C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6] was indifferent, d-dimer and thromboembolic incidence (COVID-19 = 23.7% vs. non-COVID-19 = 5.3%, P = 0.002) driven by pulmonary embolism rates (COVID-19 = 17.1% vs. non-COVID-19 = 2.6%, P = 0.005) were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury was frequent in severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, but still less frequent than in similarly severe pneumonias of other origin, indicating that cardiac involvement may not be a specific feature of COVID-19.

However, less is known about its impact on vulnerable populations, such as veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Data were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative cohort of U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. 19.2% of veterans screened positive for SI peri-pandemic. Relative to veterans without SI, they had lower income, were more likely to have been infected with COVID-19, reported greater COVID-19-related financial and social restriction stress, and increases in psychiatric symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. A multivariable analysis revealed that older age, greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity, past-year SI, lifetime suicide attempt, psychosocial difficulties, COVID-19 infection, and past-year increase in psychiatric symptom severity were linked to peri-pandemic SI, while pre-pandemic higher income and purpose in life were protective. Among veterans who were infected with COVID-19, those aged 45 or older and who reported lower purpose in life were more likely to endorse SI. Monitoring for suicide risk and worsening psychiatric symptoms in older veterans who have been infected with COVID-19 may be important. Interventions that enhance purpose in life may help protect against SI in this population.","Na, Peter J; Tsai, Jack; Hill, Melanie L; Nichter, Brandon; Norman, Sonya B; Southwick, Steven M; Pietrzak, Robert H",J Psychiatr Res,602,2

Inclusion criteria required use of mechanical ventilation, the presence of ARDS, and a PaO2/FiO2 of &lt; 150 during the first 72 hours following intubation. The primary outcome was use of prone positioning within 48 hours of the first qualifying PaO2/FiO2. Secondary outcomes were time to prone positioning and in-hospital mortality. The proportions of patients placed in the prone position in 2019 versus 2020 was compared using Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of early prone position (within 6 hours) with inhospital mortality in univariate models and models adjusted for age, sex and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Results: Of 43 patients with COVID-19 that met inclusion criteria, 35 (81%) were proned within 48 hours of meeting oxygen criteria compared to 5 (25%) of 20 qualifying ARDS cases in 2019 (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 1). Among those patients in whom it was used, prone positioning was used within 6 hours of meeting in oxygen criteria in 37% vs. 10% of patients in the COVID-19 vs. pre-COVID-19 ARDS patients (p=0.04). Overall, 37% of COVID-19 participants and 50% of non-COVID-19 ARDS patients died. Those proned within 6 hours of meeting oxygen criteria had numerically lower mortality compared to those not proned or proned later (33 vs. 44%), but this was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in univariate or adjusted logistic regression models (adjusted odds ratio=0.43, 95% CI 0.12-1.57). Conclusions: Use of prone positioning for patients with moderate to severe ARDS markedly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Larger studies are needed to define the changes in prone positioning frequency in different settings and to understand why and how this rapid change in practice occurred. This understanding may inform interventions to more broadly implement evidence based ARDS care in a sustained fashion.","Hochberg, C.; Eakin, M. N.; Hager, D.

This is especially true with more frequent, higher intensity SRT. SRT delivered via telehealth has the potential to mitigate such travel-related financial, physical stress and psychological stress burdens. Hypothesis: The High-Intensity Tele-speech Therapy for Stroke (HITTS) pilot program will reduce burden for the stroke survivor:care partner dyad compared with in-person visits. Methods: We adapted evidence-based aphasia therapies implemented into a telehealth delivery model for four stroke survivor:care partner dyads over a six-week period. Following an initial face-toface evaluation, skilled SRT was delivered via telehealth for five hours per week. The projected cost of travel between their home and VA medical center (VAMC) was obtained via VA Managerial Accounting System. Appointment preparation and travel time was calculated based on a combination of dyad report and GoogleMaps. All completed a survey at the end of HITTS regarding potential value of HITTS, perceived burden, and open text fields. Results: HITTS saved dyads (mean ± SD) both money ($370.96 ± 63.26) and time (16.47 ± 3.55 hours) over the six-week period. Increased burden was commonly reported for in-person appointments but not for telehealth appointments. Patients more commonly reported physical burden of attending in-person appointments whereas care partners more commonly reported psychological burden (Table). Conclusions: Dyad burden was not associated with a high intensity STR program, likely attributable to the reduction in resources required to attend in-person visits. HITTS is a promising healthcare delivery model which can also promote social distancing and reduce COVID exposure for high-risk stroke patients and their care partners.(Figure Presented).","Mehta, S.; Sico, J.

Objective: To assess US adults' preferences regarding COVID-19 vaccine prioritization. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study involved 2 independent, online surveys of US adults aged 18 years and older, 1 conducted by Gallup from September 14 to 27, 2020, and the other conducted by the COVID Collaborative from September 19 to 25, 2020. Samples were weighted to reflect sociodemographic characteristics of the US population. Exposures: Respondents were asked to prioritize groups for COVID-19 vaccine and to rank their prioritization considerations. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study assessed prioritization preferences and agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Preliminary Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine. Results: A total of 4735 individuals participated, 2730 (1474 men [54.1%]; mean [SD] age, 59.2 [14.5] years) in the Gallup survey and 2005 (944 men [47.1%]; 203 participants [21.5%] aged 55-59 years) in the COVID Collaborative survey. In both the Gallup COVID-19 Panel and COVID Collaborative surveys, respondents listed health care workers (Gallup, 93.6% [95% CI, 91.2%-95.3%]; COVID Collaborative, 80.0% [95% CI, 78.0%-81.9%]) and adults of any age with serious comorbid conditions (Gallup, 78.6% [95% CI, 75.2%-81.7%]; COVID Collaborative, 72.9% [95% CI, 70.7%-74.9%]) among their 4 highest priority groups. Respondents of all political affiliations agreed with prioritizing Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (Gallup, 74.2% [95% CI, 70.6%-77.5%]; COVID Collaborative, 84.9% [95% CI, 83.1%-86.5%]), and COVID Collaborative respondents were willing to be preceded in line by teachers and childcare workers (92.5%; 95% CI, 91.2%-93.7%) and grocery workers (85.9%; 95% CI, 84.2%-87.5%). Older respondents in both surveys were significantly less likely than younger respondents to prioritize healthy adults aged 65 years and older among their 4 highest priority groups (Gallup, 23.7% vs 39.1% [&#967;2 = 2160.8; P < .001]; COVID Collaborative, 23.3% vs 28.8% [&#967;2 = 5.0198; P = .03]). COVID Collaborative respondents believed the 4 most important considerations for prioritization were preventing COVID-19 spread (78.4% [95% CI, 76.3%-80.3%]), preventing the most deaths (72.1% [95% CI, 69.9%-74.2%]), preventing long-term complications (68.9% [66.6%-71.9%]), and protecting frontline workers (63.8% [95% CI, 61.5%-66.1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: US adults broadly agreed with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's prioritization framework. Respondents endorsed prioritizing racial/ethnic communities that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and older respondents were significantly less likely than younger respondents to endorse prioritizing healthy people older than 65 years. This provides reason for caution about COVID-19 vaccine distribution plans that prioritize healthy adults older than a cutoff age without including those younger than that age with preexisting conditions, that aim solely to prevent the most deaths, or that give no priority to frontline workers or disproportionately affected communities.","Persad, Govind; Emanuel, Ezekiel J; Sangenito, Samantha; Glickman, Aaron; Phillips, Steven; Largent, Emily A",JAMA Netw Open,602,28
290715,290715,290715,Lung Fibrosis Sequelae After Recovery from COVID-19 Infection,17.82983,6.554888,2021,"PURPOSE: Acute appendicitis is one of the most common reasons for emergency medical consultation. While simple appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics or surgery, complex appendicitis including gangrene, abscess, and perforation requires appendectomy. During the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, an overall drop in emergency room consultations was observed. We therefore aimed to investigate the incidence and treatment strategies of acute appendicitis during that period. METHODS: Data of insurance holders with the ICD code for ""acute appendicitis"" or OPS procedure of appendectomy of a major health insurance company in Germany were analyzed retrospectively. Groups were built, containing of the means of March-June of 2017, 2018, and 2019, defined as ""pre-COVID group"" with the ""COVID group,"" defined as data from March to June of 2020. Data was analyzed by age, sex, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, diagnoses, and treatment. Data of the COVID group was analyzed for simultaneous COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic of early 2020, an overall reduction by 12.9% of patients presenting with acute appendicitis was noticeable. These results were mainly due to decreased rates of uncomplicated appendicitis, while complicated appendicitis was scarcely affected. Especially in the group of females < 40 years, a drastic reduction was visible. Rates of extended surgery did not change. Likewise, the complication rate like appendix stump leakage or need for re-operation did not differ. In March 2020, 4.8% of acute appendicitis patients had concomitant COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: In line with the overall drop of emergency room visits during the COVID-19 pandemic of spring 2020 in Germany, a significantly lowered number of patients with uncomplicated appendicitis were noticeable, whereas complicated appendicitis did not differ. Also, treatment and complication rate of acute appendicitis did not change. These findings might be a hint that acute appendicitis is not a progressing disease but caused by different entities for uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis and therefore another clue that uncomplicated appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics or observation. Nevertheless provided data does not cover outpatient treatment; therefore, no statement observation or antibiotics in outpatients can be made.","Köhler, Franziska; Acar, Laura; van den Berg, Anne; Flemming, Sven; Kastner, Carolin; Müller, Sophie; Diers, Johannes; Germer, Christoph-Thomas; Lock, Johann F; L039,; hoest, Helmut; Marschall, Ursula; Wiegering, Armin",Langenbeck&#039;s arch. surg,602,16

This study explored the factors mediating this association and whether older age was associated with increased mortality risk in the absence of other risk factors. METHODS: In UK Biobank, a population cohort study, baseline data were linked to COVID-19 deaths. Poisson regression was used to study the association between current age and COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: Among eligible participants, 438 (0.09%) died of COVID-19. Current age was associated exponentially with COVID-19 mortality. Overall, participants aged &#8805;75 years were at 13-fold (95% CI 9.13-17.85) mortality risk compared with those <65 years. Low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, high systolic blood pressure, low handgrip strength, and multiple long-term conditions were significant mediators, and collectively explained 39.3% of their excess risk. The associations between these risk factors and COVID-19 mortality were stronger among older participants. Participants aged &#8805;75 without additional risk factors were at 4-fold risk (95% CI 1.57-9.96, P = 0.004) compared with all participants aged <65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Higher COVID-19 mortality among older adults was partially explained by other risk factors. 'Healthy' older adults were at much lower risk.

The intravascular innate immune system (IIIS), including the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolysis systems, which is crucial for recognizing and eliminating microorganisms and debris in the body, is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 ARDS. Biomarkers for IIIS activation were studied in the first 66 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Uppsala University Hospital, both cross-sectionally on day 1 and in 19 patients longitudinally for up to a month, in a prospective study. IIIS analyses were compared with biochemical parameters and clinical outcome and survival. Blood cascade systems activation leading to an overreactive conjunct thromboinflammation was demonstrated, reflected in consumption of individual cascade system components, e.g., FXII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen and in increased levels of activation products, e.g., C4d, C3a, C3d,g, sC5b-9, TAT, and D-dimer. Strong associations were found between the blood cascade systems and organ damage, illness severity scores, and survival. We show that critically ill COVID-19 patients display a conjunct activation of the IIIS that is linked to organ damage of the lung, heart, kidneys, and death. We present evidence that the complement and in particular the kallikrein/kinin system is strongly activated and that both systems are prognostic markers of the outcome of the patients suggesting their role in driving the inflammation. Already licensed kallikrein/kinin inhibitors are potential drugs for treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Lipcsey, Miklós; Persson, Barbro; Eriksson, Oskar; Blom, Anna M; Fromell, Karin; Hultström, Michael; Huber-Lang, Markus; Ekdahl, Kristina N; Frithiof, Robert; Nilsson, Bo",Front Immunol,602,28

Methods: The clinical data of 38 young adults with femoral neck fracture who met the selection criteria between January 2018 and August 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the different methods of cannulated screw implanting, the patients were divided into two groups, 19 cases in each group. The trial group was treated with closed reduction and cannulated screw rhombic distribution internal fixation, while the control group was treated with closed reduction and cannulated screw inverted triangular distribution internal fixation. There was no significant differences in patients' gender, age, cause of injury, Garden classification of fracture, and time from injury to operation between the two groups ( P>0.05). The fracture healing time, the incidence of nonunion, femoral neck shortening, and femoral head necrosis were recorded and compared between the two groups; the effectiveness was evaluated by Harris score and visual analogue scale (VAS) score at last follow-up. Results: The incisions of the two groups healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 12-24 months with an average of 15.5 months. There were 1 case of fracture nonunion and 2 cases of shortening of femoral neck in the trial group; while there were 2 cases of fracture nonunion, 1 case of necrosis of femoral head, and 6 cases of femoral neck shortening in the control group; the difference in the incidence of complications (15.8% vs. 47.4%) between the two groups was significant ( &#967; 2=4.385, P=0.036). The remaining 18 cases in the trial group and 17 cases in the control group all achieved osteonal union, and the healing time was (14.8±1.6) weeks and (15.9±1.3) weeks, respectively, showing no significant difference between the two groups ( t=1.265, P=0.214). At last follow-up, Harris score and VAS score of the trial group were 88.9±4.3 and 1.1±0.7, respectively, while those of the control group were 86.9±5.9 and 1.3±0.9, respectively, showing no significant difference ( t=0.603, P=0.550; t=1.152, P=0.257). Hip function was evaluated in accordance with Harris score, the results were excellent in 12 cases, good in 6 cases, and fair in 1 case in the trial group, the excellent and good rate was 94.74%; the results were excellent in 10 cases, good in 7 cases, and fair in 2 cases in the control group, the excellent and good rate was 89.47%; there was no significant difference in the excellent and good rate between the two groups ( &#967; 2=0.368, P=0.544). Conclusion: The short-term effectiveness of the two kinds of cannulated screw implanting methods is clear, rhomboid fixation of 4 screws has strong stability with stress distribution, which can effectively reduce the incidence of femoral neck shortening, fracture nonunion, femoral head necrosis, and other complications.","Wang, Zhaodong; Guan, Jianzhong; Wu, Min; Zhu, Zhonglian; Zhou, Pinghui; Liu, Yajun; Xu, Chen; Zhao, Yupeng",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,602,23

Social isolation measures affect some populations more than others, and people with drug and/or alcohol disorders (SUDs) are more likely to be adversely affected. This study presents, for the first time, laboratory data on the use of alcohol and drugs in a high-risk population during Italy's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty subjects with SUDs were monitored for the use of illicit drugs and alcohol every 3 months before, during and after the lockdown, by hair analysis. The number of samples positive for heroin, cocaine, MDMA and cannabis fell considerably during the lockdown and then resumed to pre-lockdown levels when the period of confinement was over. Interestingly, the consumption of benzodiazepines and alcohol followed the opposite trend; both the number of benzodiazepine-positive samples and the level of alcohol consumption increased and remained high, even at the end of the lockdown. The confinement measures produced significant changes in drug/alcohol use patterns, with a shift toward the use of substances that were more easily accessible, used as self-medication for negative feelings, and used to alleviate the effects of abstinence from drugs that were no longer readily available.","Gili, Alessio; Bacci, Mauro; Aroni, Kyriaki; Nicoletti, Alessia; Gambelunghe, Angela; Mercurio, Isabella; Gambelunghe, Cristiana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),602,16

The analyses of these lesions benefited from different autopsy studies. Thus, these lesions were observed in different organs, tissues and cells. These observations allowed us to rapidly improve the knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with this emergent infectious disease. The virus can be detected in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, molecular biology and/or electron microscopy approaches. However, many uncertainties are still present concerning the direct role of the SARS-CoV-2 on the different lesions observed in different organs, outside the lung, such as the heart, the brain, the liver, the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney and the skin. In this context, it is pivotal to keep going to increase the different tissue and cellular studies in the COVID-19 positive patients aiming to better understanding the consequences of this new infectious disease, notably considering different epidemiological and co-morbidities associated factors.

The underlying pathological mechanisms of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), such as increased inflammatory and immune responses, endothelial damage, prothrombotic status, were expected to increase the incidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), but observational studies so far indicate an important reduction in ACS admissions and treatment, possibly because of the fear of contagion, reorganization of medical structures and reduction of physical activity.

They have different levels of tolerance to opioid effects which challenge the anesthesiologists in search of safe and effective opioid dosing perioperatively. The tested hypothesis is that simple measures introduced will allow us to measure tolerance qualitatively. Opioid effects on pain (analgesia) and dyspnea sensations (relieving effect) are tested. Patients were allocated to three groups according to pre-operative analgesics: (1) control, without any opioid analgesics, (2) weak opioid, and (3) strong opioid. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) and no-respiratory sensation period (NRSP) were measured at two points: before and 3 min after intravenous fentanyl administration. RESULTS: A total of 58 (43 controls, 9 weak opioids, and 6 strong opioids) patients were enrolled. PPT and NRSP, after iv 2 µg/kg ideal body weight (IBW) fentanyl, were significantly elevated in the control patients (PPT: 6.2 ± 2.1 N to 9.2 ± 3.9 N, p < 0.0001, NRSP: 17.8 ± 10.8 s to 22.8 ± 18.7 s, p < 0.005, paired t test). However, preoperative opioid use, though with tendency, did not show a significant decrease of the opioid effect. Due to an insufficient number of participants, no conclusion could be drawn. Further analysis of the data from control patients showed a significant difference between the two sexes in sensitivity to PPT and NRSP, as well as fentanyl effect on PPT. CONCLUSIONS: Current data showed a simple method of measuring the opioid effect on two dimensions: pain and respiration. Though not able to show a qualitative measurement of tolerance formation in opioid-users, data from control patients showed females to be more sensitive to pain and dyspnea but is less sensitive to the opioid effect. Further studies are necessary to show whether these gender differences serve as clinical relevance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN, UMIN 000011580.

Texture-based analysis in scope of other pulmonary diseases has been used to screen, monitor, and provide valuable information for several kinds of diagnoses. To differentiate COVID-19 patients from healthy subjects and patients with other pulmonary diseases is crucial. Our goal is to quantify lung modifications in two pulmonary pathologies: COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). For this purpose, we propose the use of a three-dimensional multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE3D) algorithm. The three groups tested (COVID-19 patients, IPF, and healthy subjects) were found to be statistically different for 9 scale factors ( p < 0.01 ). A complexity index (CI) based on the sum of entropy values is used to classify healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients showing an accuracy of 89.6 % , a sensitivity of 96.1 % , and a specificity of 76.9 % . Moreover, 4 different machine-learning models were also used to classify the same COVID-19 dataset for comparison purposes.","Gaudêncio, Andreia S; Vaz, Pedro G; Hilal, Mirvana; Mahé, Guillaume; Lederlin, Mathieu; Humeau-Heurtier, Anne; Cardoso, João M",Biomed Signal Process Control,602,13

However, young children can lack a fundamental understanding of germ transfer. A Germ's Journey educational resources were designed to support young children in learning about germs and handwashing. These resources include a book, website, song, online games and glo-gel activities that are informed by a behaviour change model. RESEARCH GAP: Prior research has not evaluated the impacts of these resources on behavioural outcomes. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Two intervention studies evaluated the impacts of these resources on both knowledge and behavioural outcomes. METHOD: In Study 1, children (n = 225) were recruited from four schools and randomly assigned by classrooms to participate in a multicomponent intervention (vs. control). In Study 2, children (n = 104) were recruited from a museum and randomly assigned to participate in a song intervention (vs. control). Trained observers recorded participants' engagement in six handwashing behaviours and their understanding of germs. These behavioural and knowledge outcomes were analysed using regression and related analyses. RESULTS: In Study 1, significant improvements were observed between baseline and follow up in the intervention group for both behavioural scores (Est = 0.48, SE = 0.14, t = 3.30, p = 0.001) and knowledge scores (Est = 2.14, SE = 0.52, z = 4.11, p < 0.001), whereas these improvements were not observed in the control group (ts < 1). In Study 2, the intervention group had significantly higher behavioural scores compared to the control group (Est. = -0.71, SE = 0.34, t = -2.07, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that specifically designed hand hygiene educational resources can improve handwashing practice and understanding in young children, and could lead to the reduction of the transmission of disease within this group.","Younie, Sarah; Mitchell, Chloe; Bisson, Marie-Josee; Crosby, Sapphire; Kukona, Anuenue; Laird, Katie",PLoS One,602,20

It is well demonstrated that malnutrition is related to worse outcomes in acute and chronic diseases. During this sanitary emergency the Clinical Nutrition Unit in Bologna developed an early nutrition protocol for hospital ad home COVID-19 patients. Methods and procedures Recently published recommendations regarding nutritional needs in COVID-19 patients and general Clinical Nutrition Guidelines were searched on PubMed. Results The hospital algorithm considered three different steps: oral feeding, enteral feeding and parenteral nutrition, recommending early nutrition therapy (within 24-48 hours of hospitalization). We arranged a modified oral ""COVID diet"" consisting in soft or creamy hypercaloric-hyperproteic meals in disposable packages . As far as artificial nutrition is concerned we chose hypercaloric, high-protein Oral Nutrition Supplements (ONS), enteral formulas and parenteral formulas, all enriched with EPA and DHA. Due to high micronutrients requirements each patient was recommended high-dose uniparenteral vitamin D and thiamine. For home COVID-19 patients screening using NRS-2003 was recommended: for those at low nutritional risk we provided general nutritional advice;for those at intermediate risk we suggested a dietitian consultation for personalized nutritional plan or ONS prescription. For those at high nutritional risk the nutritionist physician evaluation was suggested for disease-specific ONS or artificial nutrition prescription. All patients were suggested vitamin D 2000 IU / day and a multivitamin supplement.

During her most recent inpatient admission, she was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for catatonia. Our treatment team was hopeful that ECT was making a difference for this patient. However, she was only able to receive two sessions of treatment due to new hospital protocols related to the coronavirus pandemic. Although the patient was not suspected to have the coronavirus, she could no longer undergo ventilation with a bag and mask during the procedure. Bag-mask ventilation is known to aerosolise the coronavirus and other diseases and potentially put healthcare workers at risk. Although orotracheal intubation also aerosolises the coronavirus, this was the only means of airway management still allowed by anaesthesia providers at this time. Our psychiatry team estimated that the risks of intubation outweighed the benefits of treatment, and ECT was cancelled. Without additional ECT treatments, the patient again decompensated for several weeks before being stabilised on clozapine, haloperidol and lorazepam. Although she eventually had a positive treatment outcome, her hospital course was likely prolonged due to unforeseen events related to the novel coronavirus. We feel that the current medical climate is unprecedented and is interfering with necessary psychiatric treatment in an unanticipated way. Anaesthesiologists will need to be flexible while working with psychiatrists and identify safe ways to provide this necessary psychiatric treatment for patients.","Casano, Kelsey; Capone, Erin",Gen Psychiatr,602,4

Objectives This study sought to determine pediatric SARS-CoV-2 disease burden during local mitigation efforts by using antibody testing to compare seroprevalence estimates to cumulative PCR prevalence estimates. Study Design In this cross-sectional study, we collected 1142 strict phase and 1196 relaxed phase remnant blood specimens from patients less than 19-years-old in southwestern Pennsylvania (SWPA). Patients were excluded if their residential zip code was outside the region of interest, if they were under 6-months-old, or they had recently received antibody-modifying treatments. Demographic, encounter, and laboratory electronic medical record information was extracted. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG using an EUA ELISA, and PCR results were recorded from county health department data. Seroprevalence and Clopper-Pearson exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results The observed seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies in children during strictest mitigation was 0.53% (95% CI 0.19, 1.14) and 0.92% (95% CI 0.46,1.64) during moderately relaxed. Strict and relaxed phase PCR-based prevalence were significantly higher, 2.87% (95% CI 1.95, 4.08) and 3.64 (95% CI 3.01, 4.38), respectively. Conclusions Estimates of pediatric seroprevalence were significantly lower than cumulative PCR prevalence estimates, and less than adult seroprevalence estimates, potentially due to biological, population, or sampling differences. Biological differences in pediatric immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 may make serosurvey interpretation challenging and these differences warrant further study.","Rapsinski, Glenn J.; Freeman, Megan Culler Haidar Ghady Belle Steven H.; Hasskamp, Joanne H.; Wheeler, Sarah E.",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,602,33

Hence, this review was undertaken to analyse the available evidence on bioaerosols in OSPs, and their significance in COVID-19 transmission. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, bioRxiv and Lancet preprint databases for studies on bioaerosols in OSPs. Random-effects metanalysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of key bioaerosol characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB-SPEO tool; overall strength of evidence was assessed by the GRADE approach. Results: 17 studies were included in the systematic review, and 6 in different sets of meta-analyses. The pooled estimate of particle density was 390.74â¯µg/m3, Total Particle Count, 6.08â¯×â¯106/m3, and Microbial Air Contamination, 8.08â¯CFU/m3. Small sized particles (</â¯=â¯0.5 µm) were found to be 37 and 1604 times more frequent in the aerosol cloud in comparison to medium and large sized particles respectively. 4 studies reported that haemoglobin could be detected in aerosols, and one study showed that HIV could be transmitted by blood aerosolized by electric saw and burr. The risk of bias for all studies in the review was determined to be high, and the quality of evidence, low. Conclusion: Whereas there is evidence to suggest that OSPs generate large amounts of bioaerosols, their potential to transmit infectious diseases like COVID-19 is questionable. High-quality research, as well as consensus minimum reporting guidelines for bioaerosol research in OSPs is the need of the hour.","Sharma, Siddhartha; John, Rakesh; Patel, Sandeep; Neradi, Deepak; Kishore, Kamal; Dhillon, Mandeep S",,602,12

The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is extensively glycosylated with 22 occupied N glycan sites and is required for viral entry. In other glycosylated viral proteins, glycosylation is required for interaction with calnexin and chaperone-mediated folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, and prevention of this interaction leads to unfolded viral proteins and thus inhibits viral replication. As such, we investigated two iminosugars, celgosivir, a pro-drug of castanospermine, and UV-4, or N-(9-methoxynonyl)-1-deoxynojirimycin, a deoxynojirimycin derivative. Iminosugars are known inhibitors of the &#945;-glucosidase I and II enzymes and were effective at inhibiting authentic SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in a cell culture system. Celgosivir prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death and reduced viral replication and Spike protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in culture with Vero E6 cells. Castanospermine, the active form of celgosivir, was also able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, confirming the canonical castanospermine mechanism of action of celgosivir. The monocyclic UV-4 also prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced death and reduced viral replication after 24 hours of treatment, although the reduction in viral copies was lost after 48 hours. Our findings suggest that iminosugars should be urgently investigated as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","Clarke, Elizabeth C; Nofchissey, Robert A; Ye, Chunyan; Bradfute, Steven B",Glycobiology,602,30

Recent events, determined by the COVID-19 outbreak, forced us to develop methods of control, in order to lower the reproductive number and overall, reduce the number of cases. We propose a software simulation method centered on in what manner a virus spreads inside a closed space. This approach required the implementation of a simplified model of human behavior, while considering the factors that influence the rate of transmission between individuals. Agent-based simulation allowed us to identify different control and prevention means, which are efficient in reducing the natural evolution of a pandemic. The results of the analysis offered insight into the rate of spread and human behavior, or habits that led to a significant increase in the total number of infected agents. Recent literature discussed the simulation of disease spread among the inhabitants of larger areas or studied the way that the pathogen can be spread from person to person through droplets containing the virus. Though we strongly consider that previous studies offer important insight, preventing the spread among smaller groups can let us maintain our activity in a safe and supervised manner. The model has been validated by a series of simulations with respect to COVID-19 real data.","Vezeteu, P. V.; Nastac, D.

To inform the design of Internet-based interventions for older adults, the current study of U.S. older adults examines gender and age divides in searching for and sharing COVID-19 information on the Internet. METHODS: A secondary analysis of survey data from the Pew Research Center fielded March 19-24, 2020. Bivariate probit regressions jointly estimated how searching for and sharing information on the Internet about COVID-19 were associated with the age and gender of U.S. older adults (50 or older), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, younger older adults (50-64) were more likely than their older counterparts (65 or older) to search for and share information about COVID-19 and men, regardless of age, were less likely than women to share information. While men are usually more likely than women to search for information, women who are younger older adults were most likely to search for COVID-19 information. DISCUSSION: Internet-based interventions for older adults should consider how gender shapes their exposure to pandemic stressors. Men, who were already at risk of social isolation before the pandemic, may be candidates for interventions encouraging social uses of the Internet. Women between 50 and 64 were most likely among adults to provide care for another adult before the pandemic, which may be shaping their online information needs.","Campos-Castillo, Celeste",,602,14

To overcome these issues, we performed a global scale study considering 134,871 virologic-climatic-demographic data (209 countries, first 16 weeks of the pandemic). To analyze the relation among COVID-19, population density, and climate, a theoretical path diagram was hypothesized and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), a powerful statistical technique for the evaluation of causal assumptions. The results of the analysis showed that both climate and population density significantly influence the spread of COVID-19 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Overall, climate outweighs population density (path coefficients: climate vs. incidence = 0.18, climate vs. prevalence = 0.11, population density vs. incidence = 0.04, population density vs. prevalence = 0.05). Among the climatic factors, irradiation plays the most relevant role, with a factor-loading of - 0.77, followed by temperature (- 0.56), humidity (0.52), precipitation (0.44), and pressure (0.073); for all p < 0.001. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that climatic factors significantly influence the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

FE noise is attributed to a broadband part and narrowband components-forced expiratory wheezes (FEWs). FE respiratory noise is composed by acoustic and hydrodynamic mechanisms. An origin of the most powerful mid-frequency FEWs (400-600 Hz) is associated with the 0th-3rd levels of bronchial tree in terms of Weibel [(2009). Swiss Med. Wkly. 139(27-28), 375-386], whereas high-frequency FEWs (above 600 Hz) are attributed to the 2nd-6th levels of bronchial tree. The laboratory prototype of the apparatus is developed, which includes the electret microphone sensor with stethoscope head, a laptop with external sound card, and specially developed software. An analysis of signals by the new method, including FE time in the range from 200 to 2000 Hz and band-pass durations and energies in the 200-Hz bands evaluation, is applied instead of FEWs direct measures. It is demonstrated experimentally that developed FE acoustic parameters correspond to basic indices of lung function evaluated by spirometry and body plethysmography and may be even more sensitive to some respiratory deviations. According to preliminary experimental results, the developed technique may be considered as a promising instrument for acoustic monitoring human lung function in extreme conditions, including diving and space flights. The developed technique eliminates the contact of the sensor with the human oral cavity, which is characteristic for spirometry and body plethysmography. It reduces the risk of respiratory cross-contamination, especially during outpatient and field examinations, and may be especially relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Korenbaum, Vladimir I; Pochekutova, Irina A; Kostiv, Anatoly E; Malaeva, Veronika V; Safronova, Maria A; Kabantsova, Oksana I; Shin, Svetlana N",J Acoust Soc Am,602,15

Here, we show that AhR is activated in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus (CoV), and contributes to the upregulation of downstream effector TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP) during infection. Knockdown of TiPARP reduced viral replication and increased interferon expression, suggesting that TiPARP functions in a proviral manner during MHV infection. We also show that MHV replication induced the expression of other genes known to be downstream of AhR in macrophages and dendritic cells and in livers of infected mice. Further, we found that chemically inhibiting or activating AhR reciprocally modulated the expression levels of cytokines induced by infection, specifically, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), consistent with a role for AhR activation in the host response to MHV infection. Furthermore, while indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) drives AhR activation in other settings, MHV infection induced equal expression of downstream genes in wild-type (WT) and IDO1-/-macrophages, suggesting an alternative pathway of AhR activation. In summary, we show that coronaviruses elicit AhR activation by an IDO1-independent pathway, contributing to upregulation of downstream effectors, including the proviral factor TiPARP, and to modulation of cytokine gene expression, and we identify a previously unappreciated role for AhR signaling in CoV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses with human and agricultural significance. Characterizing the mechanisms by which coronavirus infection dictates pathogenesis or counters the host immune response would provide targets for the development of therapeutics. Here, we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is activated in cells infected with a prototypic coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), resulting in the expression of several effector genes. AhR is important for modulation of the host immune response to MHV and plays a role in the expression of TiPARP, which we show is required for maximal viral replication. Taken together, our findings highlight a previously unidentified role for AhR in regulating coronavirus replication and the immune response to the virus.","Grunewald, Matthew E.; Shaban, Mohamed G.; MacKin, Samantha R.; Fehr, Anthony R.; Perlman, Stanley",J.

For this reason, this study was performed to determine the prevalence of pain in patients with Covid-19 in the world by SR/MA method. Methodology: The researchers collected English language articles in which COVID-19 was confirmed and all SRs/MAs and case reports articles were excluded. Search was carried on at SCOPUS®, PubMed® / MEDLINE®, Web of Science®, Science Direct® and Google Scholar's search engine. To extract the data the checklist contained general information about articles, e.g. authors' names, year of publication, number of patients, country, journal's name, and specific information, e.g. prevalence and percentage of 'sore throat', 'abdominal pain' 'chest pain', 'headache' and 'myalgia'. Results: According to the findings, 326 articles were extracted in the initial search, 218 articles of these were classified as duplicate articles because of the frequency in their authors, magazines and sample size, and were excluded. Also, by reviewing the title, abstract and complete files of articles, 73 articles were excluded as being non-relevant. Out of 35 remaining articles 2 were SRs/MAs in the field of COVID-19 by Iranian authors, and were also excluded. In the remaining 33 articles included in this SR/MA study, the sample size was 3781 patients.

Subexponential and exponential models were developed to analyze and predict the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic. Probabilistic models were applied to assess the probability of secondary infections while availing public transport after the release of the lockdown. RESULTS: The model predicted that transition from subexponential to exponential transmission occurs around the eighth week after the reporting of a cluster of cases. The probability of secondary infections with a single index case in an enclosure of the city bus, the suburban train general coach, and the ladies coach was found to be 0.192, 0.074, and 0.114, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Nowcasting at the early stage of the epidemic predicts the probable time point of the exponential transmission and alerts the public health system. After the lockdown release, public transportation will be the major source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in metro cities, and appropriate strategies based on nowcasting are needed.","Krishnamurthy, Kamalanand; Ambikapathy, Bakiya; Kumar, Ashwani; Britto, Lourduraj De",JMIR Public Health Surveill,602,21

Vitamin D (VITD) deficiency has been suggested to alter SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the course of disease. Thus, we aimed to investigate associations of VITD status to disease presentation within the CovILD registry. This prospective, multicenter, observational study on long-term sequelae includes patients with COVID-19 after hospitalization or outpatients with persistent symptoms. Eight weeks after PCR confirmed diagnosis, a detailed questionnaire, a clinical examination, and laboratory testing, including VITD status, were evaluated. Furthermore, available laboratory specimens close to hospital admission were used to retrospectively analyze 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at disease onset. A total of 109 patients were included in the analysis (60% males, 40% females), aged 58 ± 14 years. Eight weeks after the onset of COVID-19, a high proportion of patients presented with impaired VITD metabolism and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. PTH concentrations were increased in patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, while VITD levels were not significantly different between disease severity groups. Low VITD levels at disease onset or at eight-week follow-up were not related to persistent symptom burden, lung function impairment, ongoing inflammation, or more severe CT abnormalities. VITD deficiency is frequent among COVID-19 patients but not associated with disease outcomes. However, individuals with severe disease display a disturbed parathyroid-vitamin-D axis within their recovery phase. The proposed significance of VITD supplementation in the clinical management of COVID-19 remains elusive.","Pizzini, Alex; Aichner, Magdalena; Sahanic, Sabina; Böhm, Anna; Egger, Alexander; Hoermann, Gregor; Kurz, Katharina; Widmann, Gerlig; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Weiss, Günter; Tancevski, Ivan; Sonnweber, Thomas; Löffler-Ragg, Judith",Nutrients,602,1

The aim was to identify possible tissue-specific patterns and signatures of variant selection for each respiratory compartment. Six patients, admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, were included in the study. Thirteen URT and LRT were analyzed by NGS amplicon-based approach on Ion Torrent Platform. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using both realized in-house and supplied by ThermoFisher programs. Phylogenesis showed clade V clustering of the first patients diagnosed in Italy, and clade G for later strains. The presence of quasispecies was observed, with variants uniformly distributed along the genome and frequency of minority variants spanning from 1% to ~30%. For each patient, the patterns of variants in URT and LRT were profoundly different, indicating compartmentalized virus replication. No clear variant signature and no significant difference in nucleotide diversity between LRT and URT were observed. SARS-CoV-2 presents genetic heterogeneity and quasispecies compartmentalization in URT and LRT. Intra-patient diversity was low. The pattern of minority variants was highly heterogeneous and no specific district signature could be identified, nevertheless, analysis of samples, longitudinally collected in patients, supported quasispecies evolution.","Rueca, Martina; Bartolini, Barbara; Gruber, Cesare Ernesto Maria; Piralla, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Giombini, Emanuela; Messina, Francesco; Marchioni, Luisa; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Di Caro, Antonino; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria",,602,16

Much of the current literature on mentoring in gastroenterology is based on expert opinion rather than data. In this study, we aimed to identify gender-related barriers to successful mentoring relationships from the mentor and mentee perspectives. METHODS: A voluntary, web-based survey was distributed to physicians at 20 academic institutions across the United States. Overall, 796 gastroenterology fellows and faculty received the survey link, with 334 physicians responding to the survey (42% response rate), of whom 299 (90%; 129 women and 170 men) completed mentorship questions and were included in analysis. RESULTS: Responses of women and men were compared. Compared with men, more women preferred a mentor of the same gender (38.6% women vs 4.2% men, P < 0.0001) but less often had one (45.5% vs 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Women also reported having more difficulty finding a mentor (44.4% vs 16.0%, P < 0.0001) and more often cited inability to identify a mentor of the same gender as a contributing factor (12.8% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0004). More women mentors felt comfortable advising women mentees about work-life balance (88.3% vs 63.8%, P = 0.0005). Nonetheless, fewer women considered themselves effective mentors (33.3% vs 52.6%, P = 0.03). More women reported feeling pressured to mentor because of their gender (39.5% vs 0.9% of men, P < 0.0001). Despite no gender differences, one-third of respondents reported negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their ability to mentor and be mentored. DISCUSSION: Inequities exist in the experiences of women mentees and mentors in gastroenterology, which may affect career advancement and job satisfaction.","Rabinowitz, Loren Galler; Grinspan, Lauren Tal; Zylberberg, Haley M; Dixon, Rebekah; David, Yakira N; Aroniadis, Olga C; Chiang, Austin; Christie, Jennifer; Fayad, Nabil F; Ha, Christina; Harris, Lucinda A; Ko, Cynthia W; Kolb, Jennifer; Kwah, Joann; Lee, Linda; Lieberman, David; Raffals, Laura E; Rex, Douglas K; Shah, Shailja C; Siddiqui, Uzma D; Smith, Michael S; Wallace, Michael; Williams, Renee; Woods, Karen; Crowe, Sheila E; Kumta, Nikhil A; Kim, Michelle Kang; Greenwald, David A",Am. j. gastroenterol.

Through an ethnographic-style exploration, we reveal multi-faceted spatial changes in the ritual performance, including the reconfiguration of home spaces, the performance of worship practices outside temple doors and the mobilization of digital spaces of communication to accumulate good fortune. Apart from these spatial strategies, local ritual transformation also produces temporal adaptations.

A posterior reduction is the most widespread treatment so far, although the development of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) is one of the possible complications of this procedure. The contour of the proximal part of the rod could influence the occurrence of PJK in SK patients. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the proximal rod contour on the occurrence of a PJK complication in SK patients. METHODS: This retrospective monocentric study was performed in the Nanjing Spine Surgery Department. All eligible patients had undergone posterior correction surgery with pedicle screws only between 2002 and 2017 and had at least 24 months of follow-up. The presence of PJK was quantified on radiographs using the proximal junctional angle (PJA > 10° at the last follow-up). The authors propose a new radiological parameter to measure the angulation of the proximal part of the instrumentation: the proximal contouring rod angle (PCRA) is the angle between the upper endplate of the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) and the lower endplate of the second vertebra caudal to the UIV. The patients were analyzed according to the presence or absence of PJK. A t-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and logistic regression analysis were performed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients treated for SK were included in this study. The mean age was 18.6 ± 8.5 years, and the mean follow-up was 42.5 ± 16.4 months. The mean correction rate of global kyphosis was 46.4% ± 13.7%. At the last follow-up, 17 patients (27.4%) presented with PJK. No significant difference was found between the PJK and non-PJK groups in terms of age and other preoperative variables. A significant difference in the postoperative PCRA was found between the PJK and non-PJK groups (8.2° ± 4.9° vs 15.7° ± 6.6°, respectively; p = 0.001). A postoperative PCRA less than 10.1° predicted a significantly higher risk for PJK (p = 0.002, OR 2.431, 95% CI 1.781-4.133). CONCLUSIONS: Under-contouring of the proximal part of the rods (lower than 10°) is a risk factor for PJK after posterior correction of SK.","Grelat, Michael; Du, Chang-Zhi; Xu, Liang; Sun, Xu; Qiu, Yong",J Neurosurg Spine,602,29

Governments responded with lockdowns and increases in transfers. Empirical evidence shows that lockdowns and healthcare saturation contribute to explain the cross-country variation in GDP drops even after controlling for COVID-19 cases and mortality. We explain this output-pandemia tradeoff as resulting from a shock to subsistence health demand that is larger at higher capital utilization in a model with entrepreneurs and workers. The health system moves closer to saturation as the gap between supply and subsistence narrows, which worsens consumption and income inequality. An externality distorts utilization, because firms do not internalize that lower utilization relaxes healthcare saturation. The optimal policy response includes lockdowns and transfers to workers. Quantitatively, strict lockdowns and large transfer hikes can be optimal and yield sizable welfare gains because they prevent a sharp rise in inequality. Welfare and output costs vary in response to small parameter changes or deviations from optimal policies. Weak lockdowns coupled with weak transfers programs are the worst alternative and yet are in line with what several emerging and least developed countries have implemented.","Mendoza, E.

Furthermore, patients with existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease, have a worse clinical outcome following contraction of the viral illness. A striking feature of COVID-19 pandemics is the high incidence of fatalities in advanced aged patients: this might be due to the prevalence of frailty and cardiovascular disease increase with age due to endothelial dysfunction and loss of endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study involved 172 individuals who had headache due to COVID-19 infection. A detailed analysis of such headache was done through a face-to-face interview. Patients with any other form of secondary headache were excluded. Labs, including lymphocytic count, C-reactive protein, D-dimer and ferritin and chest imaging, were made available. RESULTS: THE: majority of our patients had a diffuse headache (52.9%). It was pressing in 40.7%, with median intensity of 7 (assessed by visual analogue scale) and median frequency of 7 days/week. Patients with preexisting primary headache (52.9%) had significantly more frequent COVID-19 related headache than those without (47.1%) (p = 0.001). Dehydrated patients (64.5%) had more frequent COVID-19 related headache than those who were not dehydrated (35.5%) (p = 0.029). Patients with fever (69.8%) had significantly higher frequency and intensity of COVID-19 related headache compared to those without fever (30.2%) (p = 0.003, 0.012). Patients with comorbidities (19.8%) had significantly higher frequency and intensity of headache than those without comorbidities (80.2%) (p = 0.006, 0.003). After multiple linear regression, primary headache disorders, dehydration and comorbidities were considered predictors of frequency of COVID-19 related headache. Meanwhile, fever and dehydration were predictors of pain intensity. CONCLUSION: Healthcare providers of COVID-19 patients need to be aware of frequency and intensity predictors of COVID-19 related headache: Primary headache disorders, fever, dehydration, and comorbidities.","Magdy, Rehab; Hussein, Mona; Ragaie, Christine; Abdel-Hamid, Hoda M; Khallaf, Ahmed; Rizk, Hoda I; Dahshan, Ahmed",Cephalalgia,602,16

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system is not uniformly expressed in all of the human races, and current differences could explain some of the geographical discrepancies in infection around the world. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that the ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. As two-thirds of hypertensive patients take ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current antihypertensive drugs in COVID-19.

We report how a decision might be reached and reported on, to include or exclude these participants. We illustrate using a motivating scenario from the BREATHE trial (Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02426112) evaluating azithromycin for the treatment of chronic lung disease in people aged 6-19 years with HIV in Zimbabwe and Malawi. KEY POINTS: Including all enrolled and randomised participants in the primary analysis of a trial ensures an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect using intention-to-treat principles, and minimises the effects of confounding through balanced allocation to trial arm. Ineligible participants are sometimes enrolled, due to measurement or human error. Of 347 participants enrolled into the BREATHE trial, 11 (3.2%) were subsequently found to be ineligible based on lung function criteria. We assumed no safety risk of azithromycin treatment; their inclusion in the trial and subsequent analysis of the intervention effect therefore mirrors clinical practice. Senior trial investigators considered diurnal variations in the measurement of lung function, advantages of retaining a higher sample size and advice from the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and Trial Steering Committee, and decided to include these participants in primary analysis. We planned and reported analyses including and excluding these participants, and in our case the interpretation of treatment effect was consistent. CONCLUSION: The decision, by senior investigators, on whether to exclude enrolled participants, should reflect issues of safety, treatment efficacy, statistical power and measurement error. As long as decisions are made prior to finalising the statistical analysis plan for the trial, the risk of exclusions creating bias should be minimal. The decision taken should be transparently reported and a sensitivity analysis can present the opposite decision.","Rehman, Andrea M; Ferrand, Rashida; Allen, Elizabeth; Simms, Victoria; McHugh, Grace; Weiss, Helen Anne",BMJ Open,602,5

Many mathematical models have been proposed to investigate the inflection point (IP) and the spread pattern of COVID-19. However, no researchers have applied social network analysis (SNA) to cluster their characteristics. We aimed to illustrate the use of SNA to identify the spread clusters of COVID-19. Cumulative numbers of infected cases (CNICs) in countries/regions were downloaded from GitHub. The CNIC patterns were extracted from SNA based on CNICs between countries/regions. The item response model (IRT) was applied to create a general predictive model for each country/region. The IP days were obtained from the IRT model. The location parameters in continents, China, and the United States were compared. The results showed that (1) three clusters (255, n = 51, 130, and 74 in patterns from Eastern Asia and Europe to America) were separated using SNA, (2) China had a shorter mean IP and smaller mean location parameter than other counterparts, and (3) an online dashboard was used to display the clusters along with IP days for each country/region. Spatiotemporal spread patterns can be clustered using SNA and correlation coefficients (CCs). A dashboard with spread clusters and IP days is recommended to epidemiologists and researchers and is not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yie, Kyent-Yon; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chou, Willy; Su, Shih-Bin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),602,16

In vitro, we show that, although &#916;H69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. &#916;H69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of spike proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation. In addition, replacement of the H69 and V70 residues in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike (where &#916;H69/V70 occurs naturally) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus. Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild-type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on &#916;H69/V70.

Convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies against the virus has been used with some success. We did a systematic review to synthesize the available data on CP therapy for treatment of Covid-19 to study the efficacy and safety outcomes. Methods.: Two reviewers searched the published and pre-published literature between 1 January 2019 and 23 June 2020 for studies comparing the use of CP with standard therapy for Covid-19 patients. Data from the selected studies were abstracted and analysed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the quality of evidence was graded as per GRADE. Results.: We found 13 case series and 1 randomized trial that fulfilled our search criteria. Of the 12 case series with a total of 264 patients that reported the efficacy outcomes, 11 studies showed favourable results with survival benefit. The only RCT with 103 patients did not show any mortality benefit but was terminated early prior to complete enrolment. A single large study of 5000 patients reported safety outcomes and showed no major adverse events in patient streated with CP. Conclusion.: There is very low-quality evidence to suggest efficacy and safety of CP in patients with Covid-19 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 has severely crippled the healthcare system and has caused huge economic losses. Following the outbreak, the SARS-CoV-2 was recognized timely and its genome was sequenced, leading to the development of real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for its detection in clinical samples collected from suspected cases. The management of the pandemic is limited by a number of misconceptions and insufficient information about laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 to confirm the disease. This includes a lack of awareness about procedures for the collection, transport, testing, and handling of biological samples for COVID diagnosis.

This paper aims at estimating the impact on regional productive systems in Italy of the interplay between the epidemic and the mobility restriction measures put in place to contain the contagion. We focus then on the economic consequences of alternative lockdown lifting schemes. We leverage a massive dataset of human mobility which describes daily movements of over four million individuals in Italy and we model the epidemic spreading through a metapopulation SIR model, which provides the fraction of infected individuals in each Italian district. To quantify economic backslashes this information is combined with socio-economic data. We then carry out a scenario analysis to model the transition to a post-lockdown phase and analyze the economic outcomes derived from the interplay between (a) the timing and intensity of the release of mobility restrictions and (b) the corresponding scenarios on the severity of virus transmission rates. Using a simple model for the spreading disease and parsimonious assumptions on the relationship between the infection and the associated economic backlashes, we show how different policy schemes tend to induce heterogeneous distributions of losses at the regional level depending on mobility restrictions. Our work shed lights on how recovery policies need to balance the interplay between mobility flows of disposable workers and the diffusion of contagion.","Spelta, Alessandro; Flori, Andrea; Pierri, Francesco; Bonaccorsi, Giovanni; Pammolli, Fabio",Sci Rep,602,27

When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.","Haldar, Sattwick; Kaleeswaran, Dhananjayan; Rase, Deepak; Roy, Kingshuk; Ogale, Satishchandra; Vaidhyanathan, Ramanathan",,602,22

Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a model where age is a factor, considering the study area's age stratification. Additionally, we want to account for the effects of quarantine on the SEIR model. METHODS: We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR). RESULTS: The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to ""flatten"" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat. CONCLUSIONS: Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.","Bongolan, Vena Pearl; Minoza, Jose Marie Antonio; de Castro, Romulo; Sevilleja, Jesus Emmanuel",J Med Internet Res,602,20

In this essay, we describe the multilevel governmental response in Argentina to address gender-based violence during the first month of mandatory stay-at-home order amid the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. National and provincial governments enacted innovative and coordinated responses to gender-based violence that targeted systemic causes of gender-based violence, ensured continuity of existing services, and generated new communication strategies to allow nonverbal reporting during the pandemic. The Argentinean example suggests that governmental organizations should consider the gendered effects of government responses to emergencies and respond through a multilevel and cross-sectoral response to protect groups disproportionately affected by the crisis and resulting policy.","Polischuk, Luciana; Fay, Daniel L.",Am.

METHODS: We analyzed positive COVID-19 testing results counts within New York City ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) with Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. RESULTS: Spatial clustering accounted for approximately 32% of the variation in the data. There was a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of a positive COVID-19 test. (IDR = 4.8, 95% Cr I 2.4, 9.7) associated with the proportion of Black / African American residents. Increases in the proportion of residents older than 65 years, housing density and the proportion of residents with heart disease were each associated with an approximate doubling of risk. In a multivariable model including estimates for age, COPD, heart disease, housing density and Black/African American race, the only variables that remained associated with positive COVID-19 testing with a probability greater than chance were the proportion of Black/African American residents and proportion of older persons. CONCLUSIONS: Areas with large proportions of Black/African American residents are at markedly higher risk that is not fully explained by characteristics of the environment and pre-existing conditions in the population.","DiMaggio, Charles; Klein, Michael; Berry, Cherisse; Frangos, Spiros",Ann. epidemiol,602,16

The psychological status of cancer survivors is affected by their social environment. In this study, we investigated the psychological status and psychological symptoms of Chinese cancer survivors. METHODS: A longitudinal study design was adopted, and an online sample of cancer survivors was successfully recruited via the Internet communities of cancer support groups. From 14 February to 25 May, 111 cancer survivor families completed the symptom checklist 90 (SCL-90) online three times (T1:14 to 24 February; T2: 1 to 10 April; T3: 15 to 25 May). RESULTS: For survivors and their family members, the mean total score of the SCL-90 was 172.05 (13.30) and 142.76 (26.80) at T1, 155.91 (12.18) and 133.42 (15.93) at T2, and 142.75 (11.56) and 130.14 (14.16) at T3, respectively. The SCL-90 scores of cancer survivors were significantly higher than those of family members and Chinese norms at T1, T2, and T3. Nine psychological symptoms of the SCL-90 in cancer survivors significantly declined from T1 to T2 and T3. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on cancer survivors and their families.

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: A 3D printed facial flap simulator was designed from a computed tomography scan and manufactured out of silicone for low-cost, high-fidelity simulation. This simulator was tested by a group of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery trainees at a single institution. The simulator group was compared to a control group who completed an exercise on a traditional paper facial flap exercise. Both groups underwent didactic lectures prior to completing their respective exercises. Pre- and post-exercise Likert scale surveys measuring experience, understanding, effectiveness, and realism were completed by both groups. Central tendency, variability, and confidence intervals were measured to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: Trainees completing the facial flap simulator reported a statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvement in overall expertise in facial flap procedures, design of facial flaps, and excision of standing cutaneous deformities. No statistically significant improvement was seen in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees found the facial flap simulator to be an effective and useful training tool with a high level of realism in surgical education of facial reconstruction. Surgical simulators can serve as an adjunct to trainee education, especially during extraordinary times such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which significantly impacted surgical training.

We aimed to compare the exposure history, signs and symptoms, laboratory, and radiographic features of ED patients who tested positive and negative for COVID-19. Methods: This was a case-control study in seven EDs in Hong Kong from 20 January to 29 February 2020. Thirty-seven patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were age- and gender-matched to 111 controls. We compared the groups with univariate analysis and calculated the odds ratio (OR) of having COVID-19 for each characteristic that was significantly different between the groups with adjustment for age and presumed location of acquiring the infection. Results: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and reported symptoms between the groups. A positive contact history within 14 days (adjusted OR 37.61, 95% CI 10.86-130.19), bilateral chest radiograph shadow (adjusted OR 13.19, 95% CI 4.66-37.35), having prior medical consultation (adjusted OR 7.43, 95% 2.89 -19.09), a lower white blood cell count (adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11-1.51), and a lower platelet count (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.12) were associated with a higher odds of COVID-19 separately. A higher neutrophil count was associated with a lower odds of COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91). Conclusion: This study highlights a number of clinical features that may be useful in identifying high-risk patients for early testing and isolation while waiting for the test result.

However, the significance of thromboembolic complications has not been widely appreciated. The purpose of this review is to provide current knowledge of this serious problem. DESIGN: Narrative review. DATA SOURCES: Online search of published medical literature through PubMed using the term ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS,"" ""acute respiratory distress syndrome,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""coagulopathy,"" ""thrombus,"" and ""anticoagulants."" STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to coagulopathy and thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019, and anticoagulant therapy. Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration. Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions. In the initial phase of the infection, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal. Increased D-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism. In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended. The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system. Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients. D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Levi, Marcel; Connors, Jean Marie; Thachil, Jecko",Crit. care med,602,30

METHODS: A survey was sent to participating academic adult cardiac surgery centers in North America. Data regarding the effect of COVID-19 on cardiac surgery training were analyzed. RESULTS: Responses were received from 53 academic institutions with diverse geographic distribution. Cardiac surgery trainee re-deployment to alternative clinical duties peaked at the height of the pandemic. We stratified institutions based on high (n = 20) and low burden (n = 33) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The majority of institutions have converted didactics (high burden 90% vs low burden 73%) and interviews for jobs/fellowships (high burden 75% vs low burden 73%) from in-person to virtual. Institutions were mixed in preference for administration of the licensing examination, with the most common preference for examinations to be held remotely on normal timeline (high burden 45% vs low burden 30%) or in person with more than 3-month delay (high burden 20% vs low burden 33%). Despite the challenges experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic on trainee clinical experience, re-deployment, and decreased operative volume, institutions expected their trainees to graduate on schedule (high burden 95% vs low burden 91%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that actions taken during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in cardiac surgery training with transition of didactics and interviews virtually and re-deployment to alternative duties.

This newly established master (2019) is equipping groups of students with different religions and worldviews for chaplaincy and leadership. The religiously and culturally plural learning environment that the master is aiming for doesn't just foster understanding of cross-religious and cross-cultural situations and contexts. It also has ambitions of shaping and altering the learning perspectives in professional chaplaincy training towards acknowledging the importance of co-formation, not just formation, in order to emphasize the meaning of relationships in learning processes and not merely the enhancement of individual knowledge and skill acquirement. This article will reflect on the learning situation of an internship module during the spring of 2020 in the master programme mentioned above, when social – or rather physical – distancing suddenly was the rule among the population due to the covid-19 pandemic. How does one teach and learn the skills necessary for generic chaplaincy, existential care and religiously-/worldview-based leadership while being confined to home? The article draws on practice theory and empirical research from other contexts in order to derive learning outcomes for this particular internship module and establishes crucial questions around internship within academic theology in the Nordic context. The main questions are: What is the educational gain from the pluralily referred to above, and what happens to internship training when the spatial circumstances for professional practice are changed into mandatory physical distancing? The article claims that working on these two questions relates to overarching questions around the place of practice in Nordic academic theology. An implicit question is whether it is possible to view practice as something happening only in a confined space.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) have a vast potential to exponentially optimize health care research. The use of AI-driven tools in LMIC can help in eradicating health inequalities and decrease the burden on health systems. METHODS: The literature search for this Scoping review was conducted through the PubMed database using keywords: COVID-19, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Low Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). Forty-three articles were identified and screened for eligibility and 13 were included in the final review. All the items of this Scoping review are reported using guidelines for PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). RESULTS: Results were synthesized and reported under 4 themes. (a) The need of AI during this pandemic: AI can assist to increase the speed and accuracy of identification of cases and through data mining to deal with the health crisis efficiently, (b) Utility of AI in COVID-19 screening, contact tracing, and diagnosis: Efficacy for virus detection can a be increased by deploying the smart city data network using terminal tracking system along-with prediction of future outbreaks, (c) Use of AI in COVID-19 patient monitoring and drug development: A Deep learning system provides valuable information regarding protein structures associated with COVID-19 which could be utilized for vaccine formulation, and (d) AI beyond COVID-19 and opportunities for Low-Middle Income Countries (LMIC): There is a lack of financial, material, and human resources in LMIC, AI can minimize the workload on human labor and help in analyzing vast medical data, potentiating predictive and preventive healthcare. CONCLUSION: AI-based tools can be a game-changer for diagnosis, treatment, and management of COVID-19 patients with the potential to reshape the future of healthcare in LMIC.","Naseem, Maleeha; Akhund, Ramsha; Arshad, Hajra; Ibrahim, Muhammad Talal",J Prim Care Community Health,602,1

Considering the critical roles of testicular cells for the transmission of genetic information between generations, we analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of adult human testis. The mRNA expression of ACE2 was expressed in both germ cells and somatic cells. Moreover, the positive rate of ACE2 in testes of infertile men was higher than normal, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may cause reproductive disorders through pathway activated by ACE2 and the men with reproductive disorder may easily to be infected by SARS-CoV-2.

Accumulating evidence suggests that emotional and cognitive self-regulation is particularly needed to effectively cope with stress. Therefore, we investigated the predictive value of affective and inhibitory prefrontal control for stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis. MethodPhysical and mental health burden were assessed using an online survey, which was administered to 104 participants of an ongoing German at-risk birth cohort during the first wave in April 2020. Two follow-ups were carried out during the pandemic, one capturing the relaxation during summer and the other the beginning of the second wave of the crisis. Prefrontal activity during emotion regulation and inhibitory control were assessed prior to the COVID-19 crisis. ResultsIncreased inferior frontal gyrus activity during emotion regulation predicted lower stress burden at the beginning of the first and the second wave of the crisis. In contrast, inferior and medial frontal gyrus activity during inhibitory control predicted effective coping only during the summer, when infection rates decreased but stress burden remained unchanged. These findings remained significant when controlling for sociodemographic and clinical confounders such as stressful life events prior to the crisis or current psychopathology. ConclusionsWe demonstrate that differential stress-buffering effects are predicted by the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and cognitive regulation at different stages during the pandemic. These findings may inform future prevention strategies to foster stress coping in unforeseen situations.

Use of antivirals has given inconsistent results; thus systematic summaries of available evidence are required for any recommendations for treatment. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of antivirals for Covid-19. Methods.: The databases we searched were-Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv. Title/abstract screening, full-text screening and data abstraction were carried out in duplicate by two researchers. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method of random effects for meta-analysis. Results.: Twenty studies were found eligible for inclusion: 6 randomized controlled trials, 9 cohort studies and 5 case series. Moderate-quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit from the use of remdesivir in improving the number of recoveries (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07-1.31; I2 = 0%) and time to recovery in days (median -3.02; 95% CI -4.98 to -1.07; I2 = 97%). A possibility of lower mortality is suggested by low-quality evidence with remdesivir (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37, I2 = 58%). Moderate-quality evidence suggests no certain benefit of using lopinavir/ritonavir for Covid-19 compared to arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with arbidol or other medications used as controls. Conclusion.: Further evidence from randomized controlled trials is required for all antivirals to treat Covid-19.

Our study characterizes the patterns of anticoagulation use in COVID-19 patients and the risk of related bleeding. METHODS: This is a single center retrospective analysis of 355 adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 1 to May 31, 2020. Chi-square was used to analyze the relationship between degree of anticoagulant dose and bleeding events by site. Multivariable logistic regression was used to look at factors associated with inpatient death. RESULTS: 61% of patients were being treated with prophylactic doses of anticoagulation, while 7% and 29% were being treated with sub-therapeutic and therapeutic anticoagulation (TA) doses respectively. In 44% of patients, we found that the decision to escalate the dose of anticoagulation was based on laboratory values characterizing the severity of COVID-19 such as rising D-dimer levels. There were significantly higher rates of bleeding from non-CNS/non-GI sites (p = 0.039) and from any bleeding site overall (p = 0.019) with TA. TA was associated with significantly higher rates of inpatient death (41.6% vs 15.3% p < 0.0001) compared to those without. All patients who developed CNS hemorrhage died p = 0.011. After multivariable logistic regression, only age OR 1.04 95% CI (1.01 to 1.07) p = 0.008 and therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with inpatient mortality OR 6.16 95% CI (2.96 to 12.83) p &#8804; 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The use of TA was significantly associated with increased risk of bleeding. Bleeding in turn exhibited trends towards higher inpatient death among patients with COVID-19.

The data were collected online, downloaded by an Excel sheet, and transferred to IBM SPSS version 24. Using questionnaire containing four parts sociodemographic, knowledge, attitude, and practice assessing. Linear logistic regression and binary logistic regression were performed to test the association between the dependent and the independent variables. We reported the 95% confidence intervals of adjusted odds ratios with a statistical significance level at less than 0.05 p-values. Results and conclusion: A total of 441 health workers were included in this study. The majority of participants were from urban (88.7%), nurses (53.1%), male (88.4%), and have a degree educational level (66.7%). The mean knowledge level of respondents was 10.13 +/- 0.057 standard deviation. The majority of respondents had a positive attitude toward control of COVID-19, 88%, and 77% of respondents had confidence that Ethiopia will control COVID-19. Similarly, male (2.746, 95% confidence interval (1.23, 6.02)) and good knowledge level (1.98, 95% confidence interval (1.01, 3.09)) were found to be a determinant for attitude regarding control of COVID-19.

Knowledge, attitude, and practice of the participant health workers are considerable, but may not be enough to control the disease. Sex, age, and profession of the health workers were determinant factors for knowledge about COVID-19. Therefore, training has to be considered for updating health care workers on COVID-19 prevention and controlled at the national level.","Fetansa, G.; Etana, B.; Tolossa, T.; Garuma, M.; Tesfaye Bekuma, T.; Wakuma, B.; Etafa, W.; Fekadu, G.; Mosisa, A.",SAGE Open Medicine,602,16

However, the MoH OIA process was obfuscating, unduly long and responded only after they anticipated imminent intervention by the Office of the Ombudsman. The amount of information provided was massive, partly irrelevant and presented in an inconvenient format. It revealed that the MoH readiness process was incomplete, and permission for the SDHB to join the NBSP was given prematurely without following due process and despite concerns expressed by some MoH staff. Subsequently, the MoH has failed to admit that they made errors in this case or have any weaknesses in their readiness assessment process. The MoH readiness process failed to determine that the SDHB was not ready to join the NBSP in 2018. Concerns have been expressed in the public media that such failures have occurred with the assessment of other DHBs. The process needs to be overhauled or replaced before further permissions are granted to DHBs.

RECENT FINDINGS: Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. SUMMARY: According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.","Póvoa, Pedro; Coelho, Luís; Salluh, Jorge",Curr. opin. infect. dis,602,9

As of April 23, 2020, 2.7 million cases have been confirmed, over 190,000 people are dead, and about 750,000 people are reported recovered. Yet, there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections. Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false-negative tests. METHODS: We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this. RESULTS: Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide. As the confusion matrix indicates, our model is able to accurately identify true negatives (74) and true positives (32); this deep learning model identified three cases of false-positive and one false-negative finding from the healthy patient scans. CONCLUSIONS: Our COVID-19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient's CXRs, and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3% accuracy.","Vaid, Shashank; Kalantar, Reza; Bhandari, Mohit",Int Orthop,602,20

To prepare for the second wave, it is vital to anticipate caseload demand, and thus, the number of required hospital beds for admitted cases and plan interventions through scenario analysis. In the present study, we analyzed the first wave data by age group so that the age-specific number of hospital admissions could be projected for the second wave. Because the age-specific patterns of the epidemic were different between urban and other areas, we analyzed datasets from two distinct cities: Osaka, where the cases were dominated by young adults, and Hokkaido, where the older adults accounted for the majority of hospitalized cases. By estimating the exponential growth rates of cases by age group and assuming probable reductions in those rates under interventions, we obtained projected epidemic curves of cases in addition to hospital admissions. We demonstrated that the longer our interventions were delayed, the higher the peak of hospital admissions. Although the approach relies on a simplistic model, the proposed framework can guide local government to secure the essential number of hospital beds for COVID-19 cases and formulate action plans.","Hayashi, Katsuma; Kayano, Taishi; Sorano, Sumire; Nishiura, Hiroshi",,602,28

METHODS: All studies published between 01 January-15 June 2020 on COVID-19 cluster infections in English electronic databases were searched, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus. All included studies were independently screened and evaluated by two authors, and information from each study was extracted using a standard form. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were included, which involved 108 cluster infections from 13 countries, areas or territories. Seventy-two (66.7%) of the cluster infections were reported in China. The major types of cluster infections were families, community transmission, nosocomial infection, gatherings, transportation, shopping malls, conferences, tourists, religious organisations, workers, prisons, offices, and nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in various circumstances, and cluster infections play an important role in the rapid evolution of COVID-19 transmission. Prevention and control measures such as social distancing must be strictly implemented to contain these cluster infections.","Liu, Tao; Gong, Dexin; Xiao, Jianpeng; Hu, Jianxiong; He, Guanhao; Rong, Zuhua; Ma, Wenjun",Int J Infect Dis,602,25

METHODS: We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic visits after the implementation of a telemedicine protocol in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Crossover rates from telehealth to in-person visits were evaluated and guidelines for performing a telemedicine neurological exam were created based on the consensus of 16 neurosurgical attending providers over a four-month period. RESULTS: From March 23, 2020 to July 20, 2020, some 2157 telehealth visits were performed in our department. Some 26 were converted to in-person visits by the provider request with the most cited reason for conversion being the need for a more detailed patient evaluation. Based on these experiences, we created a graphical tutorial to address the key components of the neurological exam with adaptations specific to the telehealth visit. CONCLUSIONS: In response to the global coronavirus pandemic, telemedicine has become an integral part of neurosurgeons' daily practice. Telemedicine failures remain low but primarily occur due to a need for more comprehensive evaluations. We provide guidelines for the neurosurgical exam during telehealth visits in an effort to assuage some of these issues.","Basil, Gregory; Luther, Evan; Burks, Joshua D; Govindarajan, Vaidya; Urakov, Timur; Komotar, Ricardo J; Wang, Michael Y; Levi, Allan D",Cureus,602,12

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nationwide cohort. PATIENT(S): Reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellowship applicants and PDs participating in the 2020 application cycle. INTERVENTION(S): Anonymous survey sent to applicants and PDs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Descriptive study evaluating the experience and satisfaction of applicants and PDs with WBIs. RESULT(S): Forty-six percent of applicants and eligible PDs responded to our survey. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were adequate for conveying a sense of a program's strengths, faculty, diversity, clinical training, and research opportunities, but less than half responded that WBIs were adequate in providing a sense of the program's clinical site and facilities. After WBIs, both applicants (73%) and PDs (86%) were able to rank with confidence. The cost of WBIs was significantly lower for both applicants (median: $100) and programs (median: $100) than the costs previously reported for in-person interviews. The applicants interviewed at more programs than they would have if the interviews were on-site, and Zoom was the highest rated platform used. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were an adequate substitute, and that they should continue after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Furthermore, most of the PDs were planning to continue to use WBIs in some capacity. CONCLUSION(S): Both applicants and PDs had favorable experiences with and perceptions of WBIs, and most endorse the continued use of this interview modality.

However, risk and clinical outcome stratification remain a great challenge. We aimed to find the potential biomarker to predict the effect of neoadjuvant CCRT on rectal cancer. METHODS: We identified epiregulin (EREG) as the most significant predictive marker for neoadjuvant CCRT response from the published rectal cancer transcriptome data set GSE35452. We collected 172 biopsy specimens from rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CCRT followed by radical proctectomy, performed EREG immunohistochemistry, and analyzed the H-scores. We further examined the correlations between the expression level of EREG and clinicopathological features, tumor regression grade, and survival, including disease-specific survival (DSS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). RESULTS: High EREG expression was significantly related to early pretreatment (pre-Tx) and posttreatment (post-Tx) tumor status (T1, T2, p = 0.047 and p < 0.001), pre-Tx and post-Tx negative nodal status (N0, p < 0.001 and p = 0.004), less vascular and perineurial invasion (p = 0.015 and p = 0.023), and higher tumor regression grade (p < 0.001). In the survival analysis, high EREG expression was significantly associated with better DSS (p < 0.0001), LRFS (p = 0.0004), and MeFS (p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, high EREG expression remained prognostically significant for better DSS (p = 0.003; hazard ratio: 5.599). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that EREG is a potential predictive marker and therapeutic target in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant CCRT.","Lin, Cheng-Yi; Hsieh, Pei-Ling; Chou, Chia-Lin; Yang, Ching-Chieh; Lee, Sung-Wei; Tian, Yu-Feng; Shiue, Yow-Ling; Li, Wan-Shan",Oncology,602,17

359169,359169,359169,Psychological impacts of COVID-19,18.110882,6.24025,2021,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests an important role of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related cytokine release storm in severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Inhibition of the IL-6 pathway with tocilizumab has been employed successfully in some of these patients but the data is mostly consistent of case reports and series. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline from 22nd April 2020 and again on 27th April 2020 using the following search terms alone or in combination: ""COVID-19,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""COVID,"" ""anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibodies,"" ""anti-IL-6,"" ""tocilizumab,"" ""sarilumab,"" ""siltuximab."" We included studies that reported individual patient data. We extracted and analyzed individual level data on baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital complications, recovery rates, effect of patient characteristics on the primary outcome and changes in levels of inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-two records were identified through a systematic search, of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. A single study currently under review was also added. Eleven observational studies encompassing 29 patients were included in the present review. There were more males (24 [82.8%]), and hypertension was the most common comorbidity (16 [48.3%]). Over an average of 5.4 hospital days, the primary endpoint occurred in 6 (20.7%) patients. Among surviving patients, about 10% had worsened disease and 17% recovered. The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (8 [27.6%]). The IL-6 level was significantly higher after the initiation of tocilizumab with median (interquartile range) of 376.6 (148-900.6) pg/mL compared to the baseline of 71.1 (31.9-122.8) pg/mL (P = .002). Mean (standard deviation) levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased following treatment 24.6 (26.9) mg/L compared to baseline 140.4 (77) mg/L (P < .0001). Baseline demographics were not significantly different among survivors and nonsurvivors by Fisher's exact test. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated, which are supportive of cytokine storm. Following initiation of tocilizumab, there is elevation in the IL-6 levels and CRP levels dramatically decrease, suggesting an improvement in this hyperinflammatory state. Ongoing randomized control trials will allow for further evaluation of this promising therapy. IMPORTANCE: Recent data indicate that severe COVID-19 causes a cytokine release storm and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and IL-6 plays an important role. It is suggestive that anti-IL-6 results in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. However, to our knowledge, there is no individual patient data systematic review performed to summarize baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab.","Antwi-Amoabeng, Daniel; Kanji, Zahara; Ford, Brent; Beutler, Bryce D; Riddle, Mark S; Siddiqui, Faisal",J. med. virol,602,24

This work makes an assessment of wildlife susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing the similarities of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) -both recognized as receptors and protease for coronavirus spike protein- and the genetic variation of the viral protein spike in the recognition sites. The sequences from different mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and the sequence from SARS-CoV-2 S protein were obtained from the GenBank. Comparisons of aligned sequences were made by selecting amino acids residues of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S protein; phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the same sequences. The species susceptibility was ranked by substituting the values of amino acid residues for both proteins. Our results ranked primates at the top, but surprisingly, just below are carnivores, cetaceans and wild rodents, showing a relatively high potential risk, as opposed to lab rodents that are typically mammals at lower risk. Most of the sequences from birds, reptiles and amphibians occupied the lowest ranges in the analyses. Models and phylogenetic trees outputs showed the species that are more prone to getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, during this short pandemic period, a high haplotypic variation was observed in the RBD of the viral S protein, suggesting new risks for other hosts. Our findings are consistent with other published results reporting laboratory and natural infections in different species. Finally, urgent measures of wildlife monitoring are needed regarding SARS-CoV-2, as well as measures for avoiding or limiting human contact with wildlife, and precautionary measures to protect wildlife workers and researchers; monitoring disposal of waste and sewage than can potentially affect the environment, and designing protocols for dealing with the outbreak.","Martínez-Hernández, Fernando; Isaak-Delgado, Ana Belem; Alfonso-Toledo, Jorge Alberto; Muñoz-García, Claudia Irais; Villalobos, Guiehdani; Aréchiga-Ceballos, Nidia; Rendón-Franco, Emilio",,602,24

A descriptive qualitative approach was employed to provide a detailed account of three different community and partnership-led responses. Data were gathered from multiple sources and through first-hand participation in the COVID-19 responses. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. This study found that the main pandemic mitigation interventions implemented were public health measures, culturally sensitive communications, lobbying for policy change and economic and social support. These interventions, supported by the health promotion strategies of partnership, advocacy and empowerment, have proven to be extremely important to reduce potential inequities in exposure to the virus and in access to healthcare. The findings suggest that community-health partnerships between minority groups' organizations and healthcare professionals represent a viable approach to mitigate the disproportionate effects of a pandemic on Travellers and Roma.","Villani, Jacopo; Daly, Petra; Fay, Ronnie; Kavanagh, Lynsey; McDonagh, Sandra; Amin, Nurul",Glob Health Promot,602,20

Objective: To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management. Design, Setting, and Participants: Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. Results: Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir.

However, arrhythmia manifestations and treatment strategies used in these patients have not been well-described. We sought to better understand the cardiac arrhythmic manifestations and treatment strategies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients through a worldwide cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) sent an online survey (via SurveyMonkey) to electrophysiology (EP) professionals (physicians, scientists, and allied professionals) across the globe. The survey was active from March 27 to April 13, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1197 respondents completed the survey with 50% of respondents from outside the USA, representing 76 countries and 6 continents. Of respondents, 905 (76%) reported having COVID-19-positive patients in their hospital. Atrial fibrillation was the most commonly reported tachyarrhythmia whereas severe sinus bradycardia and complete heart block were the most common bradyarrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest and pulseless electrical activity were reported by 4.8% and 5.6% of respondents, respectively. There were 140 of 631 (22.2%) respondents who reported using anticoagulation therapy in all COVID-19-positive patients who did not otherwise have an indication. One hundred fifty-five of 498 (31%) reported regular use of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZM); concomitant use of AZM was more common in the USA. Sixty of 489 respondents (12.3%) reported having to discontinue therapy with HCQ + AZM due to significant QTc prolongation and 20 (4.1%) reported cases of Torsade de Pointes in patients on HCQ/chloroquine and AZM.

In infectious disease studies, one person's treatment may affect another individual's outcome, i.e., there may be interference between units. For example, use of bed nets to prevent malaria by one individual may have an indirect or spillover effect to other individuals living in close proximity. In some settings, individuals may form groups or clusters where interference only occurs within groups, i.e., there is partial interference. Inverse probability weighted estimators have previously been developed for observational studies with partial interference. Unfortunately, these estimators are not well suited for studies with large clusters. Therefore, in this paper, the parametric g-formula is extended to allow for partial interference. G-formula estimators are proposed of overall effects, spillover effects when treated, and spillover effects when untreated. The proposed estimators can accommodate large clusters and do not suffer from the g-null paradox that may occur in the absence of interference. The large sample properties of the proposed estimators are derived, and simulation studies are presented demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. The Demographic and Health Survey from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is then analyzed using the proposed g-formula estimators to assess the overall and spillover effects of bed net use on malaria.","Kilpatrick, Kayla W.; Hudgens, Michael G.",,602,19

Among these, multimodal analgesic regimens stand out as a promising treatment options. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations hold great potential as effective pillars in the multimodal pain management by providing adequate analgesia with fewer safety risks due to COX inhibitors' opioid-sparing effect. Thus, these combinations, either freely or in fixed-dose formulation, offer a feasible option for the prescribing clinicians who seek to maximise therapeutic effect while simultaneously minimise adverse effects. The selection of the appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and opioid agent at optimal doses is essential. It should be tailored to the patients' analgesic necessities, and his/her gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk, and potential concurrent aspirin use. Moreover, it should allow for addiction risk and the potential opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and constipation. To ensure an optimal match between the characteristics of the patient and the properties of the chosen medication, and to guide adequate and well-tolerated treatment decisions, it is of paramount importance to expand clinicians' knowledge of the currently available COX inhibitor/opioid receptor agonist combinations. This invited narrative review deals with the literature evidence covering the components of multimodal opioid-sparing analgesic regimens. Also, it provides insights into the clinically relevant choice criteria to ensure a patient-tailored analgesia.","Varrassi, Giustino; Yeam, Cheng Teng; Rekatsina, Martina; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Zis, Panagiotis; Paladini, Antonella",Drugs,602,10

Pandemic-related restrictions and reorganization of healthcare services may affect thyroid disease management. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To analyze and discuss the relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid diseases from several perspectives. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov were searched for this purpose by using free text words and medical subject headings as follows: ""sars cov 2"", ""covid 19"", ""subacute thyroiditis"", ""atypical thyroiditis"", ""chronic thyroiditis"", ""hashimoto's thyroiditis"", ""graves' disease"", ""thyroid nodule"", ""differentiated thyroid cancer"", ""medullary thyroid cancer"", ""methimazole"", ""levothyroxine"", ""multikinase inhibitor"", ""remdesivir"", ""tocilizumab"". Data were collected, analyzed, and discussed to answer the following clinical questions: ""What evidence suggests that COVID-19 may induce detrimental consequences on thyroid function?""; ""Could previous or concomitant thyroid diseases deteriorate the prognosis of COVID-19 once the infection has occurred?""; ""Could medical management of thyroid diseases influence the clinical course of COVID-19?""; ""Does medical management of COVID-19 interfere with thyroid function?""; ""Are there defined strategies to better manage endocrine diseases despite restrictive measures and in-hospital and ambulatory activities reorganizations?"". RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 may induce thyroid dysfunction that is usually reversible, including subclinical and atypical thyroiditis. Patients with baseline thyroid diseases are not at higher risk of contracting or transmitting SARS-CoV-2, and baseline thyroid dysfunction does not foster a worse progression of COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether low levels of free triiodothyronine, observed in seriously ill patients with COVID-19, may worsen the disease's clinical progression and, consequently, if triiodothyronine supplementation could be a tool for reducing this burden. Glucocorticoids and heparin may affect thyroid hormone secretion and measurement, respectively, leading to possible misdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in severe cases of COVID-19. High-risk thyroid nodules require a fine-needle aspiration without relevant delay, whereas other non-urgent diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions should be postponed. DISCUSSION: Currently, we know that SARS-CoV-2 could lead to short-term and reversible thyroid dysfunction, but thyroid diseases seem not to affect the progression of COVID-19. Adequate management of patients with thyroid diseases remains essential during the pandemic, but it could be compromised because of healthcare service restrictions. Endocrine care centers should continuously recognize and classify priority cases for in-person visits and therapeutic procedures. Telemedicine may be a useful tool for managing patients not requiring in-person visits.","Lisco, G; De Tullio, A; Jirillo, E; Giagulli, V A; De Pergola, G; Guastamacchia, E; Triggiani, V",J. endocrinol. invest,602,16

In addition to SARS-CoV-2 causing pneumonia, many studies have reported ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19. This article describes the effects and possible underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 on ischemic stroke.Materials and methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and other COVID-dedicated databases and the combination of the keywords 'SARS-CoV-2', 'COVID-19' and 'ischemic stroke' up to November 28, 2020.Results: SARS-CoV-2 invades the host through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is expressed not only in the lungs, but also in the brain and vascular endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection might cause direct vascular disease or enhance the immunogenic thrombosis environment through several mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection can modulate the host immune response and can cause inflammation, coagulation disorders, renin angiotensin system disorders, hypoxia, and stress disorders, which may lead to the occurrence of ischemic stroke.Conclusions: Some patients with COVID-19 can develop ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke has a high risk of causing disability and is associated with a high mortality rate. It is hoped that when medical staff treat patients with COVID-19, they would pay attention to the occurrence of ischemic stroke to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.","Song, Yuxia; Fan, Hongyang; Tang, XiaoJia; Luo, Yuhan; Liu, Peipei; Chen, Yingzhu",Int J Neurosci,602,16

The synaptic mechanism of iTBS has long been known to be an effective method to induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in humans. However, there is limited evidence as to whether the antidepressant effect of iTBS is associated with change in synaptic function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in preclinical study. Hence, we applied an antidepressant (i.e., fluoxetine)-resistant depression rat model induced by severe foot-shocks to investigate the antidepressant efficacy of iTBS in the synaptic pathology. The results showed that iTBS treatment improved not only the impaired LTP, but also the aberrant long-term depression in the PFC of antidepressant-resistant depression model rats. Moreover, the mechanism of LTP improvement by iTBS involved downstream molecules of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, while the mechanism of long-term depression improvement by iTBS involved downstream molecules of proBDNF. The aberrant spine morphology was also improved by iTBS treatment. This study demonstrated that the mechanism of the iTBS paradigm is complex and may regulate not only excitatory but also inhibitory synaptic effects in the PFC.","Lee, Chi-Wei; Wu, Han-Fang; Chu, Ming-Chia; Chung, Yueh-Jung; Mao, Wei-Chang; Li, Cheng-Ta; Lin, Hui-Ching",Cereb. cortex,602,24

All patients with acute hepatitis and known chronic infection were tested for HCV RNA, HCV genotyping, and NS3, NS5A, and NS5B HCV genomic region sequencing. To identify transmission clusters, phylogenetic trees were built for each gene employing Bayesian methods. FINDINGS: All patients with acute hepatitis were infected with HCV genotype 1b. Root-cause analysis, including a lookback procedure, excluded blood donors as the source of HCV transmission. The phylogenetic analysis, conducted on seven patients with acute infection and eight patients with chronic infection, highlighted four transmission clusters including at least one patient with chronic and one patient with acute HCV infection. All patients in the same cluster received a blood transfusion during the same day. Two patients with acute hepatitis spontaneously cleared HCV within four weeks and nine patients received ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir for six weeks, all achieving a sustained virological response. CONCLUSION: Combined use of root-cause analysis and molecular epidemiology was effective in ascertaining the origin of the HCV outbreak. Antiviral therapy avoided the chronic progression of the infection and further spread in care units and in the family environment.","Mazzucco, W; Chiara di Maio, V; Bronte, F; Fabeni, L; Pipitone, R M; Grimaudo, S; Ferraro, D; Marotta, C; Aragri, M; Macaluso, M; Vitale, F; Di Raimondo, F; Ceccherini-Silberstein, F; Di Marco, V",J Hosp Infect,602,20

The coronavirus main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug design. Further, &#945;-ketoamide is proved to be very effective as a reversible covalent-inhibitor against cysteine proteases. Herein, we report on the non-covalent to the covalent adduct formation mechanism of &#945;-ketoamide-based inhibitor with the enzyme active site amino acids by QM/SQM model (QM = quantum mechanical, SQM = semi-empirical QM). To uncover the mechanism, we focused on two approaches: a concerted and a stepwise fashion. The concerted pathway proceeds via deprotonation of the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys145 SÎ³H) and simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the &#945;-ketoamide warhead. In this work, we propose three plausible concerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the first step is proton transfer from Cys145 SÎ³H to His41 NÎ´ forming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks the &#945;-keto group to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl group plays an important role. Moreover, as the &#945;-keto group has two faces Si or Re for the nucleophilic attack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and R-thiohemiketal. We computed the structural, electronic, and energetic parameters of all stationary points including transition states via ONIOM and pure DFT method. Additionally, to characterize covalent, weak noncovalent interaction (NCI) and hydrogen-bonds, we applied NCI-reduced density gradient (NCI-RDG) methods along with Bader's Quantum Theory of Atoms-in-Molecules (QTAIM) and natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis.","Banerjee, Snehasis",Biophys Chem,602,30

CO-RADS categorization of the level of COVID-19 suspicion might improve diagnostic performance.PurposeTo investigate the value of chest CT with CO-RADS classification to screen for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and to determine its diagnostic performance in individuals with COVID-19 symptoms during the exponential phase of viral spread.Materials and MethodsIn this secondary analysis of a prospective trial (Clinical Trial Number: IRB B1172020000008), from March 2020 to April 2020, we performed parallel SARS-CoV-2 PCR and CT with categorization of COVID-19 suspicion by CO-RADS, for individuals with COVID-19 symptoms and controls without COVID-19 symptoms admitted to the hospital for medical urgencies unrelated to COVID-19. CT-CORADS was categorized on a 5-point scale from 1 (very low suspicion) to 5 (very high suspicion). AUC were calculated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals to predict positive SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and likelihood ratios for each CO-RADS score were used for rational selection of diagnostic thresholds.Results859 individuals (median 70 years, IQR 52-81, 443 men) with COVID-19 symptoms and 1138 controls (median 68 years, IQR 52-81, 588 men) were evaluated. CT-CORADS had good diagnostic performance (P<.001) in both symptomatic (AUC=.89) and asymptomatic (AUC=.70) individuals. In symptomatic individuals (41.7% PCR+), CO-RADS &#8805; 3 detected positive PCR with high sensitivity (89%, 319/358) and 73% specificity. In asymptomatic individuals (5.3% PCR+), a CO-RADS score &#8805; 3 detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with low sensitivity (45%, 27/60) but high specificity (89%).ConclusionCT-CORADS had good diagnostic performance in symptomatic individuals, supporting its application for triage. Sensitivity in asymptomatic individuals was insufficient to justify its use as first-line screening approach. Incidental detection of CO-RADS &#8805; 3 in asymptomatic individuals should trigger testing for respiratory pathogens.","De Smet, Kristof; De Smet, Dieter; Ryckaert, Thomas; Laridon, Emanuel; Heremans, Birgit; Vandenbulcke, Ruben; Demedts, Ingel; Bouckaert, Bernard; Gryspeerdt, Stefaan; Martens, Geert A",Radiology,602,16

The main IVD assays used for COVID-19 employ real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that takes a few hours. But the assay duration has been shortened to 45 min by Cepheid. Of interest is the point-of-care (POC) molecular assay by Abbott that decreased the assay duration to just 5 min. Most molecular tests have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) and are Conformité Européenne (CE) marked. A wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most prominent IAs are automated chemiluminescent IA (CLIA), manual ELISA, and rapid lateral flow IA (LFIA), which detect the immunoglobulinM(IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in persons in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ongoing research efforts and advances in complementary technologies will pave the way to new POC IVD assays in the coming months.

Several comorbidities have been related to mortality in COVID-19, as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease and chronic kidney disease. AIMS: To describe the main clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the major social security institution in Mexico, as well as the contribution of chronic comorbidities and the population attributable fraction related to them. METHODS: Data for all patients with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 in the institutional database was included for analysis. Demographic information, the presence of pneumonia and whether the patient was hospitalized or treated at home as an outpatient as well as comorbidities were analyzed. Case fatality rate was estimated for different groups. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals from a logistic regression model were estimated, as well as the population attributable fraction. RESULTS: By November 13, 2020, 323,671 subjects with COVID-19 infection have been identified. Case fatality rate is higher in males (20.2%), than in females (13.0%), and increases with age. Case fatality rate increased with the presence of obesity, hypertension and/or diabetes. Age and sex were major independent risk factors for mortality, as well as the presence of pneumonia, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, immunosuppression, and end-stage kidney disease. The population attributable fraction due to obesity in outpatients was 16.8%.

In addition to physical distancing, cleaning and disinfection routines, and using face coverings, building ventilation can also be an important risk mitigation measure for controlling exposure to SARS-CoV-2 indoors. A number of studies to date, however, have focused on ventilation in medical facilities (e.g. hospitals) as the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is higher there (because of the close proximity of workers to patients who have the disease and their treatment procedures). Few studies have focused on ventilation use in nonmedical settings (e.g. office buildings and school classrooms), despite the large population of workers and community members in these facilities.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database in Korea. The study population was defined as patients who visited all 402 EDs with medical conditions other than injuries between January 27 and May 31, 2020 (after-COVID) and for the corresponding time period in 2019 (before-COVID). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The main exposure was the COVID-19 outbreak, and the interaction variable was county per capita income tax. We calculated the risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality rates by COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the difference-in-difference of risk-adjusted rates between the before-COVID and after-COVID groups according to the county income tax using a multilevel linear regression model with the interaction term. RESULTS: A total of 11,662,167 patients (6,765,717 in before-COVID and 4,896,450 in after-COVID) were included in the study with a 1.6% crude in-hospital mortality rate. The risk-adjusted mortality rate in the after-COVID group was higher than that in the before-COVID group (1.82% vs. 1.50%, difference: 0.31% [0.30 to 0.33]; adjusted odds ratio: 1.22 [1.18 to 1.25]). The excess in-hospital mortality rate of the after-COVID in the lowest quartile group of county income tax was significantly higher than that in the highest quartile group (difference-in-difference: 0.18% (0.14 to 0.23); P-for-interaction: < 0.01). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was excess in-hospital mortality among patients who visited EDs, and there were disparities in excess mortality depending on community socioeconomic positions.","Jung, Eujene; Ro, Young Sun; Ryu, Hyun Ho; Shin, Sang Do; Moon, Sungwoo",J Korean Med Sci,602,10

Our Emergency Department (ED) was designated as a COVID-19 exclusive service. We report our first 500 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: From 14 March to 16 May 2020, we enrolled all patients admitted to our ED that had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal aspirate PCR. The outcomes included hospital discharge, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death, among others. RESULTS: From 2219 patients received in the ED, we included 506 with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We found that 333 patients were discharged home (65.9%), 153 died (30.2%), and 20 (3.9%) remained in the hospital. A total of 300 patients (59.3%) required ICU admission, and 227 (44.9%) needed invasive ventilation. The multivariate analysis found age, number of comorbidities, extension of ground glass opacities on chest CT and troponin with a direct relationship with all-cause mortality, whereas dysgeusia, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker and number of lymphocytes with an inverse relationship with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This was a sample of severe patients with COVID-19, with 59.2% admitted to the ICU and 41.5% requiring mechanical ventilator support. We were able to ascertain the outcome in majority (96%) of patients. While the overall mortality was 30.2%, mortality for intubated patients was 55.9%. Multivariate analysis agreed with data found in other studies although the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker as a protective factor could be promising but would need further studies.

Thus, we conducted a prospective analysis of breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers from age 60 until age 80. METHODS: Subjects had no history of cancer and both breasts intact at age 60 (n = 699). Women were followed until a breast cancer diagnosis, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy or death. We calculated the annual cancer rate and cumulative incidence of breast cancer (invasive and in situ) from age 60 to age 80. We assessed the associations between hormone replacement therapy, family history of breast cancer and bilateral oophorectomy and breast cancer risk. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, 61 invasive and 20 in situ breast cancers were diagnosed in the cohort. The mean annual rate of invasive breast cancer was 1.8% for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 1.7% for BRCA2 mutation carriers. The cumulative risk of invasive breast cancer from age 60 to 80 was 20.1% for women with a BRCA1 mutation and was 17.3% for women with a BRCA2 mutation. Hormone replacement therapy, family history and oophorectomy were not associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large prospective study indicate that the risk of developing breast cancer remains high after age 60 in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. These findings warrant further evaluation of the role of breast cancer screening in older mutation carriers.","Stjepanovic, Neda; Lubinski, Jan; Moller, Pal; Randall Armel, Susan; Foulkes, William D; Tung, Nadine; Neuhausen, Susan L; Kotsopoulos, Joanne; Sun, Ping; Sun, Sophie; Eisen, Andrea; Narod, Steven A",Breast cancer res. treat,602,1

However, tensors extracted from real-world data are often more complex due to: (i) Partial observation: Only a small subset (e.g., 5%) of tensor elements are available. (ii) Coarse observation: Some tensor modes only present coarse and aggregated patterns (e.g., monthly summary instead of daily reports). In this paper, we are given a subset of the tensor and some aggregated/coarse observations (along one or more modes) and seek to recover the original fine-granular tensor with low-rank factorization. We formulate a coupled tensor completion problem and propose an efficient Multi-resolution Tensor Completion model (MTC) to solve the problem. Our MTC model explores tensor mode properties and leverages the hierarchy of resolutions to recursively initialize an optimization setup, and optimizes on the coupled system using alternating least squares. MTC ensures low computational and space complexity. We evaluate our model on two COVID-19 related spatio-temporal tensors. The experiments show that MTC could provide 65.20% and 75.79% percentage of fitness (PoF) in tensor completion with only 5% fine granular observations, which is 27.96% relative improvement over the best baseline. To evaluate the learned low-rank factors, we also design a tensor prediction task for daily and cumulative disease case predictions, where MTC achieves 50% in PoF and 30% relative improvements over the best baseline.","Yang, Chaoqi; Singh, Navjot; Xiao, Cao; Qian, Cheng; Solomonik, Edgar; Sun, Jimeng",,602,16

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the delivery of in-person clinical care and clinical research. We conducted an online survey of active clinician members of the Parkinson Study Group (PSG) to evaluate the adoption of various non-face-to-face methods in clinical practice and research in PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a survey using the open-access online SurveyMonkey tool (http://www.surveymonkey.com). The survey had 27 items and was designed to elucidate clinical/research care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 414 active PSG members with weekly reminders and it remained accessible for 30 days from May 2020. RESULTS: We received 142 responses, of which 133 (93.7%) provided demographic data. The clinical use of virtual visits via synchronous video conferencing increased from 39.5% pre-COVID-19 to 94.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of access for patients (68.2%) and patient resistance (51.4%) were the top barriers for its use. Approximately 70% respondents stated that 75-100% of their research activities were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many sites had to fill out protocol deviations (38.2%), protocol exceptions (25.5%) or change their research profile due to layoffs (16.8%). The overall use of video conferencing increased from 30.3% to 64.1%. CONCLUSION: The current results suggest a need for flexibility in conducting office visits and clinical trials in PD patients. Technology has the potential to enhance patient care and convenience, when in-person visits can be challenging.","Shivkumar, Vikram; Subramanian, Thyagarajan; Agarwal, Pinky; Mari, Zoltan; Mestre, Tiago A",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,602,23

Surface Plasmon Resonance assays have been performed to determine the binding affinity between PDZ domain of wild type human PALS1 protein and tetradecapeptides representing the SLiMs sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins (E-SLiMs). SARS-CoV-2 E-SLiM binds to the human target protein with a higher affinity compared to SARS-CoV-1, showing a difference significantly greater than previously reported using the F318W mutant of PALS1 protein and shorter target peptides. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have provided clear evidence of the structural determinants driving this binding process. Specifically, the Arginine 69 residue in the SARS-CoV-2 E-SLiM is the key residue able to both enhance the specific polar interaction with negatively charged pockets of the PALS1 PDZ domain and reduce significantly the mobility of the viral peptide. These experimental and computational data are reinforced by the comparison of the interaction between the PALS1 PDZ domain with the natural ligand CRB1, as well as the corresponding E-SLiMs of other coronavirus members such as MERS and OCF43. Our results provide a model at the molecular level of the strategies used to mimic the endogenous SLiM peptide in the binding of the tight junctions of the host cell, explaining one of the possible reasons of the severity of the infection and pulmonary inflammation by SARS-CoV-2.","Lo Cascio, Ettore; Toto, Angelo; Babini, Gabriele; De Maio, Flavio; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Mordente, Alvaro; Della Longa, Stefano; Arcovito, Alessandro",,602,24

Within the past year, masks have been used as a public health response to limit the spread of the virus. This sudden change has rendered many face recognition based access control, authentication and surveillance systems ineffective. Official documents such as passports, driving license and national identity cards are enrolled with fully uncovered face images. However, in the current global situation, face matching systems should be able to match these reference images with masked face images. As an example, in an airport or security checkpoint it is safer to match the unmasked image of the identifying document to the masked person rather than asking them to remove the mask. We find that current facial recognition techniques are not robust to this form of occlusion. To address this unique requirement presented due to the current circumstance, we propose a set of re-purposed datasets and a benchmark for researchers to use. We also propose a contrastive visual representation learning based pre-training workflow which is specialized to masked vs unmasked face matching. We ensure that our method learns robust features to differentiate people across varying data collection scenarios. We achieve this by training over many different datasets and validating our result by testing on various holdout datasets. The specialized weights trained by our method outperform standard face recognition features for masked to unmasked face matching. We believe the provided synthetic mask generating code, our novel training approach and the trained weights from the masked face models will help in adopting existing face recognition systems to operate in the current global environment.

The results often largely depend on the approach used to value mortality risk reductions, typically expressed as the value per statistical life (VSL). Many analyses rely on a population-average VSL estimate; some adjust VSL for life expectancy at the age of death. We explore the implications of theory and empirical studies, which suggest that the relationship between age and VSL is uncertain. We compare the effects of three approaches: (1) an invariant population-average VSL; (2) a constant value per statistical life-year (VSLY); and (3) a VSL that follows an inverse-U pattern, peaking in middle age. We find that when applied to the U.S. age distribution of COVID-19 deaths, these approaches result in average VSL estimates of $10.63 million, $4.47 million, and $8.31 million. We explore the extent to which applying these estimates alters the conclusions of frequently cited analyses of social distancing, finding that they significantly affect the findings. However, these analyses do not address other characteristics of COVID-19 deaths that may increase or decrease the VSL estimates. Examples include the health status and income level of those affected, the size of the risk change, and the extent to which the risk is dreaded, uncertain, involuntarily incurred, and outside of one's control. The effects of these characteristics and their correlation with age are uncertain; it is unclear whether they amplify or diminish the effects of age on VSL.","Robinson, Lisa A; Sullivan, Ryan; Shogren, Jason F",Risk anal,602,16

This paper presents an epidemiological analysis of the first phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out between 3 and 27 March 2020 on a sample of 1389 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Poland. Data were obtained from epidemiological reports collected by the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate. Analysis includes the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, number of people quarantined, and number of laboratory tests performed. RESULTS The first case was confirmed on 4 March 2020. Over 24 days after the first case, the total number of confirmed infections rose to 1389 (34,000 laboratory tests were performed). The highest incidence rates (over 5 per 100,000) were observed in the 2 central administrative regions (Mazowieckie and Lódzkie) and in the south-western region of Dolnoslaskie, which borders the Czech Republic and Germany. Based on available data about age and sex, a clearly higher incidence was observed in the 20-29 years (4.0 per 100,000), 40-49 years (4.1 per 100,000), and 50-59 years (4.3 per 100,000) age groups. In the period analyzed (24 days), there were 16 confirmed deaths (average age 65.5 years; 81.2% males). CONCLUSIONS The proportion of women and men with confirmed COVID-19 infection was similar to the sex ratio in the general population. Infections were relatively less common in those aged under 20 years. The largest numbers of confirmed cases were detected in 3 of the 4 largest cities, each of which has an international airport.","Gujski, Mariusz; Raciborski, Filip; Jankowski, Mateusz; Nowicka, Paulina Maria; Rakocy, Kamil; Pinkas, Jaroslaw",Med Sci Monit,602,16

In this work, we develop a facile, time-saving, and surfactant-assisted method to fabricate a new Z-scheme heterojunction based on TiO2/BiOCl. This photocatalyst is rich in oxygen vacancy defects (TiO2-OV-BiOCl), and displays an excellent photocatalytic degradation performance for imidacloprid (IMD), and a possible degradation pathway of IMD is provided. The surfactant F127 plays an essential role in regulating the oxygen vacancy defects (OVDs) of TiO2-OV-BiOCl, where the OVD mainly exists in 5 layer BiOCl ultrathin nanosheets. Free radical trapping experiments demonstrate that the introduction of an OVD in BiOCl as a 'charge mediator' changes the charge-transfer mode from a type-II mechanism to a Z-scheme mechanism. The formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction leads to an excellent light utilization and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers with a prolonged lifetime compared to those of BiOCl and TiO2/BiOCl. This work highlights the critical role of an OVD in the construction of a Z-scheme heterojunction of TiO2/BiOCl, and it can be applied to construct efficient photocatalytic systems for pesticide degradation.","Yang, Bin; Zheng, Jiliang; Li, Wei; Wang, Rongjie; Li, Danya; Guo, Xuhong; Rodriguez, Raul D; Jia, Xin",,602,23

Because of the COVID-19 infection, the lockdown was introduced, but the effects on preschool wheezers are unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an improvement in outcomes during the lockdown, and these would be lost when the lockdown was eased. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent medical visits before and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We recorded the childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) and a clinical questionnaire. Data on symptoms, the need for medications and the use of healthcare resources were recorded. We compared these data with retrospective reports from the preceding year and prospectively acquired questionnaires after lockdown. RESULTS: We studied 85 preschool wheezers, mean age 4.9 years. During the lockdown, cACT score was significantly higher (median 25 vs. 23); families reported a dramatic drop in wheezing episodes (51 vs. none), significant reductions in the day and nighttime symptoms, including episodes of shortness of breath (p < .0001); the use of salbutamol and oral corticosteroids (OCS) dropped significantly (p < .0001) and 79 (95%) patients needed no OCS bursts during the lockdown. Finally, patients had significantly fewer extra medical examinations, as well as fewer Emergency Room visits (p < .0001). All were improved compared with the same time period from the previous year, but outcomes worsened significantly again after lockdown (cACT median: 22). CONCLUSIONS: During the national lockdown, children with persistent preschool wheeze showed a significant clinical improvement with reduction of respiratory symptoms, medication use for exacerbations, and use of healthcare resources. This trend reversed when lockdown restrictions were eased.","Ullmann, Nicola; Allegorico, Annalisa; Bush, Andrew; Porcaro, Federica; Negro, Valentina; Onofri, Alessandro; Cherchi, Claudio; De Santis, Simone; Rosito, Lorenza; Cutrera, Renato",Pediatr Pulmonol,602,21

To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21-40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).","Ahmed, Md Zahir; Ahmed, Oli; Aibao, Zhou; Hanbin, Sang; Siyu, Liu; Ahmad, Akbaruddin",Asian J Psychiatr,602,22

In this work, we combine a recently developed dynamical density functional theory model and an extended SIRD model with hysteresis to study effects of various measures and strategies using realistic parameters. Depending on intervention thresholds, a variety of phases with different numbers of shutdowns and deaths are found.

Reducing inequalities is particularly pertinent in light of the Covid-19 outbreak which has exacerbated already widening inequalities in health. This study aimed to explore understandings of inequality, the anticipated pathways for reducing inequalities among CYP and key factors affecting the development and implementation of policy to reduce inequalities among CYP at a local level. METHODS: We carried out a qualitative case study of one local government region in the North of England (UK), comprising semi structured interviews (n = 16) with service providers with a responsibility for child health, non-participant observations of key meetings (n = 6 with 43 participants) where decisions around child health are made, and a local policy documentation review (n = 11). We employed a novel theoretical framework, drawing together different approaches to understanding policy, to guide our design and analysis. RESULTS: Participants in our study understood inequalities in CYP health almost exclusively as socioeconomically patterned inequalities in health practices and outcomes. Strategies which participants perceived to reduce inequalities included: preventive support and early intervention, an early years/whole family focus, targeted working in local areas of high deprivation, organisational integration and whole system/place-based approaches. Despite demonstrating a commitment to a social determinants of health approach, efforts to reduce inequalities were described as thwarted by the prevalence of poverty and budget cuts which hindered the ability of local organisations to work together. Participants critiqued national policy which aimed to reduce inequalities in CYP health for failing to recognise local economic disparities and the interrelated nature of the determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased calls for a 'whole systems' approach to reducing inequalities in health, significant barriers to implementation remain. National governments need to work towards more joined up policy making, which takes into consideration regional disparities, allows for flexibility in interpretation and addresses the different and interrelated social determinants of health. Our findings have particular significance in light of Covid-19 and indicate the need for systems level policy responses and a health in all policies approach.","Holding, Eleanor; Fairbrother, Hannah; Griffin, Naomi; Wistow, Jonathan; Powell, Katie; Summerbell, Carolyn",BMC Public Health,602,1

However, limited research has examined the change in marijuana use among persons living with HIV (PLWH). This study aimed to investigate how marijuana use changed in a cohort of PLWH during the first year of the pandemic and identify factors associated with the change. METHOD: 222 PLWH (mean age = 50.2 ± 11.2, 50.9 % female, 14.5 % Hispanic, 64.7 % Black, 15.8 % White, 5 % other, 80.2 % persons using marijuana [at least weekly use], 19.8 % persons not using marijuana) completed a baseline survey on demographics and behavioral/health characteristics between 2018 and 2020 and a brief phone survey between May and October 2020 that assessed changes in marijuana use and overall/mental health, and perceived risks/benefits of marijuana use during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the pandemic, 64/222(28.8 %) of the whole sample reported increased marijuana use, 36(16.2 %) reported decreased use, and 122(55 %) reported no change. Multinomial logistic regression results indicated that: Compared to those reporting no change, increased marijuana use during the pandemic was associated with more frequent marijuana use and PTSD symptoms at baseline, worsened mental health during the pandemic, and not perceiving marijuana use as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection. More frequent marijuana use at baseline was the only factor significantly associated with decreased marijuana use during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes in marijuana use among a considerable proportion (45 %) of PLWH. Future research is needed to understand the temporality of the increases in marijuana use with worsening mental health.","Wang, Yan; Ibañez, Gladys E; Vaddiparti, Krishna; Stetten, Nichole E; Sajdeya, Ruba; Porges, Eric C; Cohen, Ronald A; Cook, Robert L",Drug Alcohol Depend,602,24

Vitamin D also controlled asthma and rheumatoid arthritis with intakes ranging from 60,000 to 600,000 International Units (IU)/day. In the 1980s, interest in treating psoriasis with vitamin D rekindled. Since 1985 four different oral forms of vitamin D (D2, D3, 1-hydroxyvitaminD3 (1(OH)D3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (calcitriol)) and several topical formulations have been reported safe and effective treatments for psoriasis-as has UVB phototherapy and sunshine. In this review we show that many pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D concentrations fall within the current range of normal, while many post-treatment concentrations fall outside the upper limit of this normal (100 ng/mL). Yet, psoriasis patients showed significant clinical improvement without complications using these treatments. Current estimates of vitamin D sufficiency appear to underestimate serum 25(OH)D concentrations required for optimal health in psoriasis patients, while concentrations associated with adverse events appear to be much higher than current estimates of safe serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Based on these observations, the therapeutic index for vitamin D needs to be reexamined in the treatment of psoriasis and other diseases strongly linked to vitamin D deficiency, including COVID-19 infections, which may also improve safely with sufficient vitamin D intake or UVB exposure.","McCullough, Patrick J; McCullough, William P; Lehrer, Douglas; Travers, Jeffrey B; Repas, Steven J",Nutrients,602,30

The objective of our study is to develop a comprehensive machine learning (ML) modelling framework to assess the predictive value of smell and taste disorders, along with other symptoms, in COVID-19 infection. A multicenter case-control study was performed, in which suspected cases for COVID-19, who were tested by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), informed about the presence and severity of their symptoms using visual analog scales (VAS). ML algorithms were applied to the collected data to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis using a 50-fold cross-validation scheme by randomly splitting the patients in training (75%) and testing datasets (25%). A total of 777 patients were included. Loss of smell and taste were found to be the symptoms with higher odds ratios of 6.21 and 2.42 for COVID-19 positivity. The ML algorithms applied reached an average accuracy of 80%, a sensitivity of 82%, and a specificity of 78% when using VAS to predict a COVID-19 diagnosis.

A series of video conferences was convened among experts in otolaryngology, infectious diseases, public health, pharmacology, and virology to review the literature and discuss relevant findings. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal drug delivery for antiviral agents has been studied for many years. Several agents have broad-spectrum antiviral activity, but they still require human safety and efficacy trials prior to implementation. Intranasal drug delivery has potential relevance for future clinical trials in the settings of disease spread prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral diseases. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Intranasal drug delivery represents an important area of research for COVID-19 and other viral diseases. The consideration of any potential adverse reactions is paramount.","Higgins, Thomas S; Wu, Arthur W; Illing, Elisa A; Sokoloski, Kevin J; Weaver, Bree A; Anthony, Benjamin P; Hughes, Nathan; Ting, Jonathan Y",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,602,20

Already because of COVID-19, many therapists have rapidly moved to using telehealth in place of in-person contact. In response to this shift, Waller and colleagues compiled a series of expert recommendations to help clinicians pivot to delivering teletherapy to address eating disorders during COVID-19. However, numerous barriers still impede widespread adoption and implementation of digital interventions. In this commentary, we aim to extend the recommendations for clinicians offered by Waller and colleagues by presenting a roadmap of the systems- and policy-level requirements that are needed. We advocate for addressing barriers associated with training, licensing, safety, privacy, payment, and evaluation, as these factors have greatly limited use of these promising interventions. We also indicate that longer-term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped-care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self-management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system. Now is the time to catalyze change and comprehensively address the barriers that have prevented widespread delivery of these efficacious digital services to the millions of people who would benefit.","Taylor, C Barr; Fitzsimmons-Craft, Ellen E; Graham, Andrea K",Int J Eat Disord,602,24

Until data from clinical studies are available to provide solid evidence for worldwide applicable guidelines, there is a need to provide guidance to the transfusion community and researchers on this emergent therapeutic option. This paper aims to identify existing key gaps in current knowledge in the clinical application of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) initiated a multidisciplinary working group with worldwide representation from all six continents with the aim of reviewing existing practices on CCP use from donor, product and patient perspectives. A subgroup of clinical transfusion professionals was formed to draft a document for CCP clinical application to identify the gaps in knowledge in existing literature. RESULTS: Gaps in knowledge were identified in the following main domains: study design, patient eligibility, CCP dose, frequency and timing of CCP administration, parameters to assess response to CCP treatment and long-term outcome, adverse events and CCP application in less-resourced countries as well as in paediatrics and neonates.

We particularly focus on key-regulators, cell-receptors, and host-processes that are hijacked by the virus for its advantage. ACE2-controlled processes involve a key-regulator CD300e (a TYROBP receptor) and the activation of IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. We further investigate the age-dependency of such receptors and identify the adipose and the brain as potentially contributing tissues for the diseases severity in old patients. In contrast, several other tissues in the young population are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, this present study provides novel insights into the gene regulatory organization during the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the tissue-specific age dependence of the cell receptors involved in COVID-19.","Forst, Christian V; Zeng, Lu; Wang, Qian; Zhou, Xianxiao; Vatansever, Sezen; Tu, Zhidong; Zhang, Bin",,602,30

Based on the plotted shape ofH(r), the Ng-X bonds are first distinguished into types A, B, or C. Based on the topology ofH(r), and its integration over the RDG isosurface associated with the bond, any Ng-X bond is then assigned as covalent (Cov), non-covalent (nCov), or partially-covalent (pCov), and any pCov bond is further assayed in terms of the contribution of covalency (H +/−, H −/+, or H −). The method was developed by examining 47 reference species (indicated here as the NgBC47 reference set) of quite diverse bonding character. The obtained classification is, seemingly, robust with respect to the computational level, and of general applicability, as suggested also by test calculations involving some helium, neon, and argon compounds of peculiar bonding character.","Borocci, Stefano; Grandinetti, Felice; Nunzi, Francesca; Sanna, Nico",New J.

We tested associations in 3067 children using a linear mixed model and confirmed the results with meta-analysis of identified SNPs. With a stringent Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons we obtained significant associations(p < 1.4 × 10-4) for 5 SNPs, which were in high LD (r2 > 0.85) in the 16q12.2 non-coding intronic chromosomal region of FTO gene with strongest association observed for rs8050136 (effect size(ß) = 0.31, pWald = 1.52 × 10-5).

We hypothesized that patients whose lung injury resolves quickly, as measured by time to liberation from mechanical ventilation, have a higher percentage of Tregs amongst CD4+ T cells in either airway, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or peripheral blood samples. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and collected serial samples, the first within 72 h of ARDS diagnosis (day 0) and the second 48-96 h later (day 3). We analyzed immune cell populations and cytokines in BAL, tracheal aspirates and peripheral blood, as well as cytokines in plasma, obtained at the time of bronchoscopy. The study cohort was divided into fast resolvers (FR; n = 8) and slow resolvers (SR; n = 5), based on the median number of days until first extubation for all participants (n = 13). The primary measure was the percentage of CD4+ T cells that were Tregs. RESULTS: The BAL of FR contained more Tregs than SR. This finding did not extend to Tregs in tracheal aspirates or blood. BAL Tregs expressed more of the full-length FOXP3 than a splice variant missing exon 2 compared to Tregs in simultaneously obtained peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: Tregs are present in the bronchoalveolar space during ARDS. A greater percentage of CD4+ cells were Tregs in the BAL of FR than SR. Tregs may play a role in the resolution of ARDS, and enhancing their numbers or functions may be a therapeutic target.","Norton, Dustin L; Ceppe, Agathe; Tune, Miriya K; McCravy, Matthew; Devlin, Thomas; Drummond, M Bradley; Carson, Shannon S; Vincent, Benjamin G; Hagan, Robert S; Dang, Hong; Doerschuk, Claire M; Mock, Jason R",J Transl Med,602,16

The reduction in international travel and domestic movement, social distancing measures and public health action have likely slowed the spread of COVID-19 in Australia. Notifications in Australia remain predominantly among people with recent overseas travel, with some locally-acquired cases being detected. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a confirmed case, with a small portion unable to be epidemiologically linked to another case. The ratio of overseas-acquired cases to locally-acquired cases varies by jurisdiction. The crude case fatality rate (CFR) in Australia remains low (1.1%) compared to the World Health Organization's globally-reported rate (6.9%) and to other comparable high-income countries such as the United States of America (5.1%) and the United Kingdom (13.7%). The lower CFR in Australia is likely reflective of high case ascertainment including detection of mild cases. High case ascertainment and prompt identification of contacts enables an effective public health response and a reduction of disease transmission. Internationally, cases continue to increase. The rates of increase have started to slow in several regions, although it is too soon to tell whether this trend will be sustained. Interpretation of international epidemiology should be conducted with caution as it differs from country to country depending not only on the disease dynamics, but also on differences in case detection, testing and implemented public health measures.",,,602,26

We performed a scoping review to synthesize clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. Between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, we identified high-quality clinical studies describing critically ill patients with a sample size of greater than 20 patients by performing daily searches of the World Health Organization and LitCovid databases on COVID-19. Two reviewers independently reviewed all abstracts (2785 unique articles), full text (218 articles), and abstracted data (92 studies). The 92 studies included 61 from Asia, 16 from Europe, 10 from North and South America, and 5 multinational studies. Notable similarities among critically ill populations across all regions included a higher proportion of older males infected and with severe illness, high frequency of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), abnormal chest imaging findings, and death secondary to respiratory failure. Differences in regions included newly identified complications (eg, pulmonary embolism) and epidemiological risk factors (eg, obesity), less chest computed tomography performed, and increased use of invasive mechanical ventilation (70% to 100% vs 15% to 47% of intensive care unit patients) in Europe and the United States compared with Asia.

However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and COVID-19 social distancing mandates. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the intervention as they become available. The presence of time-varying external factors that impact study outcomes is a well-known limitation of SWDs; common approaches to adjusting for them make use of a mixed effects modeling framework. However, these models have several shortcomings when external factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters. Methods: We discuss limitations of commonly used mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce opioid-related mortality, and propose extensions of these models to address these limitations. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models in the presence of external factors. We consider confounding by time, premature adoption of components of the intervention, and time-varying effect modificationâ"" in which external factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters. Results: In the presence of confounding by time, commonly used mixed effects models yield unbiased intervention effect estimates, but can have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models yield biased intervention effect estimates when premature intervention adoption or effect modification are present. In such scenarios, models incorporating fixed intervention-by-time interactions with an unstructured covariance for intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased intervention effect estimates, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error. Conclusions: Mixed effects models can adjust for different combinations of external factors through correct specification of fixed and random time effects; misspecification can result in bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and Type 1 error inflation. Since model choice has considerable impact on validity of results and study power, careful consideration must be given to choosing appropriate models that account for potential external factors.","Rennert, Lior; Heo, Moonseong; Litwin, Alain H; Gruttola, Victor De",,602,27

We investigated how IAV may increase the risk for COVID-19 lung disease, focusing on the receptor Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the protease TMPRSS2, which cooperate to uptake SARS-CoV-2 intracellular. We found, using single cell RNA sequencing of distal human non-diseased lung homogenates, that at baseline, ACE2 is minimally expressed in basal, goblet, ciliated, and secretory epithelial cells populating small airways. We focused on human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), central to the pathogenesis of lung injury following viral infections. Primary SAEC from non-diseased donor lungs apically infected (at air-liquid interface) with IAV (up to 3×105â pfu; â¼1 MOI) markedly (8-fold) boosted the expression of ACE2, paralleling that of STAT1, a transcription factor activated by viruses. IAV increased the apparent electrophoretic mobility of intrac¬ellular ACE2 and generated an ACE2 fragment (90â kDa) in apical secretions, suggesting cleavage of this receptor. IAV also increased the expression of two proteases known to cleave ACE2, sheddase ADAM17 (TACE) and TMPRSS2 and increased the TMPRSS2 zymogen and its mature fragments, implicating proteolytic autoactivation. These results indicate that IAV amplifies the expression of molecules necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the distal lung. Further, posttranslational changes in ACE2 by IAV may increase the vulnerability to lung injury such as ARDS during viral co-infections. These findings support prevention and treatment efforts of influenza infections during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schweitzer, Kelly S; Crue, Taylor; Nall, Jordan M; Foster, Daniel; Sajuthi, Satria; Correll, Kelly A; Nakamura, Mari; Everman, Jamie; Downey, Gregory P; Seibold, Max A; Bridges, James P; Serban, Karina A; Chu, Hong Wei; Petrache, Irina",Eur. respir. j,602,16

While NPIs are effective in preventing health systems overload, these long-term measures are likely to have significant adverse economic consequences. Therefore, many countries are currently considering to lift the NPIs-increasing the likelihood of disease resurgence. In this regard, dynamic NPIs, with intervals of relaxed social distancing, may provide a more suitable alternative. However, the ideal frequency and duration of intermittent NPIs, and the ideal ""break"" when interventions can be temporarily relaxed, remain uncertain, especially in resource-poor settings. We employed a multivariate prediction model, based on up-to-date transmission and clinical parameters, to simulate outbreak trajectories in 16 countries, from diverse regions and economic categories. In each country, we then modelled the impacts on intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths over an 18-month period for following scenarios: (1) no intervention, (2) consecutive cycles of mitigation measures followed by a relaxation period, and (3) consecutive cycles of suppression measures followed by a relaxation period. We defined these dynamic interventions based on reduction of the mean reproduction number during each cycle, assuming a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2 for no intervention, and subsequent effective reproduction numbers (R) of 0.8 and 0.5 for illustrative dynamic mitigation and suppression interventions, respectively. We found that dynamic cycles of 50-day mitigation followed by a 30-day relaxation reduced transmission, however, were unsuccessful in lowering ICU hospitalizations below manageable limits. By contrast, dynamic cycles of 50-day suppression followed by a 30-day relaxation kept the ICU demands below the national capacities. Additionally, we estimated that a significant number of new infections and deaths, especially in resource-poor countries, would be averted if these dynamic suppression measures were kept in place over an 18-month period. This multi-country analysis demonstrates that intermittent reductions of R below 1 through a potential combination of suppression interventions and relaxation can be an effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control. Such a ""schedule"" of social distancing might be particularly relevant to low-income countries, where a single, prolonged suppression intervention is unsustainable. Efficient implementation of dynamic suppression interventions, therefore, confers a pragmatic option to: (1) prevent critical care overload and deaths, (2) gain time to develop preventive and clinical measures, and (3) reduce economic hardship globally.","Chowdhury, Rajiv; Heng, Kevin; Shawon, Md Shajedur Rahman; Goh, Gabriel; Okonofua, Daisy; Ochoa-Rosales, Carolina; Gonzalez-Jaramillo, Valentina; Bhuiya, Abbas; Reidpath, Daniel; Prathapan, Shamini; Shahzad, Sara; Althaus, Christian L; Gonzalez-Jaramillo, Nathalia; Franco, Oscar H",Eur J Epidemiol,602,17

This work aims to determine the extent to which socioeconomic and political conditions have shaped community-level distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially how these dynamics have evolved over time. METHODS: This study used daily data on physical distancing from 15â17 million cell phone users in 3,037 U.S. counties. County-level changes in the average distance traveled per person were estimated relative to prepandemic weeks as a proxy for physical distancing. Pooled ordinary least squares regressions estimated the association between physical distancing and a variety of county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and political characteristics by week from March 9, 2020 to January 17, 2021. Data were collected until January 2021, at which point the analyses were finalized. RESULTS: Lower per capita income and greater Republican orientation were associated with significantly reduced physical distancing throughout nearly all the study period. These associations persisted after adjusting for a variety of county-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Other county-level characteristics, such as the shares of Black and Hispanic residents, were associated with reduced distancing at various points during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of dynamic socioeconomic and political gradients in preventive behavior and imply the need for nimble policy responses.","Kavanagh, Nolan M; Goel, Rishi R; Venkataramani, Atheendar S",Am. j. prev. med,602,16

DESIGN: National cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire. SETTING: Online, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated; 1512 (75.3%) participants completed the survey and were included in the analysis. INTERVENTION: Data were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during 1-15 November 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scale. RESULTS: Among the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between 21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5% reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5-vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccine's efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%) and the vaccine's manufacturing country (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination. Reliable sources on vaccine efficiency could improve vaccine uptake, so healthcare authorities should use reliable information to decrease vaccine hesitancy among frontline healthcare providers.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Barry, Mazin; Aljamaan, Fadi; Alhuzaimi, Abdullah; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman; Saddik, Basema; Alrabiaah, Abdulkarim; Alsohime, Fahad; Alhaboob, Ali; Alhasan, Khalid; Alaraj, Ali; Halwani, Rabih; Alamro, Nurah Maziad; Al-Shahrani, Fatimah S; Jamal, Amr; Alsubaie, Sarah; Memish, Ziad A; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A",BMJ Open,602,26

Till now, 15 million people are infected, causing more than 600,000 deaths. The disease, commonly known as, COVID-19, was initially thought to be associated with ARDS only, but later on revealed to have many unexplained and atypical clinical features like coagulopathy and cytokinemia, leading to multi-organ involvements. The patients also suffer from 'Silent Hypoxemia', where there is no immediate respiratory signs and symptoms even though alarmingly low SpO2 level. We hypothesize that this covert hypoxemia may lead to molecular changes exacerbating coagulopathy and cytokine storm in COVID19 patients, which again, in turn, causes a vicious cycle of more hypoxemia/hypoxia and progression of the infection to more severe stages through HIF-1&#945; dependent pathway. Although molecular mechanisms are yet to be substantiated by scientific evidence, hypoxemia remains an independent worsening factor in serious COVID 19 patients. Keeping all in mind, we propose that even in the early and asymptomatic cases, prophylactic oxygen therapy to be initiated to break the vicious cycle and to reduce the mortality in COVID 19 to save precious human lives.","Chauhan, Anshika; Kaur, Rajandeep; Chakrbarti, Prantar; Pal, Arnab",Indian J Clin Biochem,602,16

Almost all hospital departments have had to profoundly modify their activity to cope with the crisis. In this context, the surgical management of cancers has been a topic of debate as care strategies were tailored to avoid any delay in treatment that could be detrimental to patient wellbeing while being careful not to overload intensive care units. The primary objective of this study was to observe changes in the surgical management of pelvic cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study analyzed data from the prospective multi-center cohort study conducted by the French Society for Pelvic and Gynecological Surgery (SCGP) with methodological support from the French (FRANCOGYN) Group. All members of the SCGP received by e-mail a link allowing them to include patients who were scheduled to undergo gynecological carcinologic surgery between March 16th 2020 and May 11th 2020. Demographic data, the characteristics of cancers and the impact of the crisis in terms of changes to the usual recommended coarse of care were collected. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients with a median age 63 years were included in the cohort. In total, 31 patients had cervical cancer, 76 patients had endometrial cancer, 52 patients had ovarian or tubal cancer, 5 patients had a borderline tumor of the ovary, and 17 patients had vulvar cancer. During the study period, the care strategy was changed for 49 (27%) patients with postponed for 35 (19.3%) patients, and canceled for 7 (3.9%) patients. Surgical treatment was maintained for 139 (76.8%) patients. Management with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was offered to 19 (10,5%) patients and a change in surgical choice was made for 5 (2,8%) patients. In total, 8 (4,4%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. Data also shows a greater number of therapeutic changes in cases of ovarian cancer as well as a cancelation of a lumbo-aortic lymphadenectomy in one patient with cervical cancer. Hospital consultants estimated a direct detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for 39 patients, representing 22% of gynecological cancers. CONCLUSION: This study provided observational data of the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the surgical management of gynecological cancers.","Jouen, Théo; Gauthier, Tristan; Azais, Henri; Bendifallah, Sofiane; Chauvet, Pauline; Fernandez, Herve; Kerbage, Yohan; Lavoue, Vincent; Lecointre, Lise; Mimoun, Camille; Ouldamer, Lobna; Seidler, Stéphanie; Siffert, Marc; Vallin, Anne-Lyse; Spiers, Andrew; Descamps, Philippe; Lacorre, Aymeline; Legendre, Guillaume",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,602,20

The effects of two herbal medicines namely Zingiber officinale and Echinacea on alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate of suspected COVID-19 outpatients were examined. METHODS: A clinical trial with 100 suspected COVID-19 outpatients as participants was conducted. The participants were allocated randomly to two groups of 50 members. The intervention group received concurrent Zingiber officinale (Tablet Vomigone 500 mg II tds) and Echinacea (Tablet Rucoldup I tds) for seven days in addition to the standard treatment. The control group only received the standard treatment (Hydroxychloroquine). After seven days, alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate were examined. In addition, 14 days after treatment, the hospitalization was assessed again by telephone follow up. RESULTS: The two groups were identical in terms of basic characteristics. Improvement level as to coughing, dyspnea, and muscle pain was higher in the intervention group (p value <0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the other symptoms. In addition, the hospitalization rate in the intervention and control groups were 2 and 6% respectively, which are not significantly different (p value >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the efficiency and trivial side-effects of Zingiber officinale and Echinacea, using them for alleviation and control of the clinical symptoms in COVID-19 outpatients is recommended.","Mesri, Mehdi; Esmaeili Saber, Seied Saeid; Godazi, Mohammadreza; Roustaei Shirdel, Aboulfazl; Montazer, Reza; Koohestani, Hamid Reza; Baghcheghi, Nayereh; Karimy, Mahmood; Azizi, Nemat",J. complement. integr. med,602,21

The secondary damage to AML is often caused by the infected jet of aortic regurgitation hitting the ventricular surface of the mitral leaflet, or by the pronounced bacterial vegetation that prolapses from the aortic valve into the left ventricular outflow tract. This is called 'kissing lesion'. We describe a patient with infective endocarditis of the aortic valve causing perforation of both noncoronary cusp of aortic valve and the AML, which is rare.","Raja, Javid; Kumar, Rupesh; Gourav, Krishna Prasad",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,602,16

Several management options have been suggested and have since gained popularity, though we expect additional modifications to be made, as well as more new cases in the coming months, given a lack of definitive treatment and well-controlled experiments. This review highlights the available and potential treatments, along with the challenges associated with each. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive overview of all peer-reviewed studies, editorial comments, and letters to the editor based on a search in PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. The following terms were used: ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""drug,"" ""treatment,"" ""medication,"" and ""management."" All searches were done between March and May 20, 2020. RESULTS: There are several potential medications available for COVID-19, such as Interferon &#945; (IFN-&#945;), Teicoplanin, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Chloroquine phosphate, Arbidol, Velpatasvir, Favipiravir, Ledipasvir, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Darunavir, Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QPD), and Imatinib. However, we do not have a definitive and specific treatment yet. CONCLUSIONS: We are expecting to have more cases in the coming weeks/months.

Using a zein suspension prepared by the antisolvent precipitation method, the impact of varying the voltage during dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) treatment on the physicochemical and conformational properties of zein in water was investigated. Analysis of the particle size, specific surface area, and free sulfhydryl content indicated that the protein solubility was maximized by treatment at 70 V for 70 s. DBD treatment destroyed covalent bonds and introduced some hydrophilic groups onto the zein surface, thus enhancing the contact area with water molecules and leading to a more uniform dispersion. A decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of zein micelles indicated that intermolecular interactions were disrupted, thus improving dispersion stability. A more hydrophilic microenvironment was formed owing to the reduction in hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, evaluation of the secondary structure demonstrated that DBD treatment broke hydrogen bonds, resulting in a loose conformation with more exposed sites of action for water. These results are expected to facilitate the development of technologies for improving utilization of zein. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Strong hydrophobicity limits the application of zein in the food industry. The study indicated that DBD treatment could promote loose structure, and improve dispersion stability and hydrophilicity of zein suspension prepared by antisolvent precipitation method. This work revealed the potential of cold plasma treatment for modifying zein and other insoluble proteins, which would expand their scope of application.","Li, Nan; Yu, Jiao-Jiao; Jin, Nan; Chen, Yue; Li, Shu-Hong; Chen, Ye",J. food sci,602,33

Although speculated that such paradoxical findings may be explained by impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in infected lung regions, no studies have determined whether such extreme degrees of perfusion redistribution are physiologically plausible, and increasing attention is directed towards thrombotic microembolism as the underlying cause of hypoxemia. Herein, a mathematical model demonstrates that the large amount of pulmonary venous admixture observed in patients with early COVID-19 can be reasonably explained by a combination of pulmonary embolism, ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the noninjured lung, and normal perfusion of the relatively small fraction of injured lung. Although underlying perfusion heterogeneity exacerbates existing shunt and ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the model, the reported hypoxemia severity in early COVID-19 patients is not replicated without either extensive perfusion defects, severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch, or hyperperfusion of nonoxygenated regions.","Herrmann, Jacob; Mori, Vitor; Bates, Jason H T; Suki, Béla",Nat Commun,602,29

Governments are racing to contain and stop the Coronavirus from reaching an epidemic/pandemic status. This research presents a way in tracking such a virus or any contagious germ capable of transferring through air specifically where such a transfer can be assisted by a mechanical room ventilation system. Tracking the spread of such a virus is a complicated process, as they can exist in a variety of forms, shapes, sizes, and can change with time. However, a beginning has to be made at some point. Assumptions had to be made based on published scientific data, and standards. The tracking of airborne viruses was carried out on the following assumption (for illustrative purposes); one person with one sneeze in a period of 600 s. The presence of viruses was tracked with curves plotted indicating how long it could take to remove the sneezed viruses from the mechanically ventilated room space. Results gave an indication of what time span is required to remove airborne viruses. Thus, we propose the following: (a) utilizing CFD software as a possible tool in optimizing a mechanical ventilation system in removing contagious viruses. This will track the dispersion of viruses and their removal. The numerical solution revealed that with one typical adult human sneeze, it can take approximately 640 s to reduce an average sneeze of 20,000 droplets to a fifth; (b) upscaling the status of human comfort to a ""must have""with regards to the 50% relative humidity, and the use of Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) air disinfection in an epidemic/pandemic condition. A recommendation can be presented to the local authorities of jurisdiction in enforcing the above proposals partially/fully as seen fit as ""prevention is better than cure"".

A selection-based screen, named two-dimensional combinatorial screening, revealed preferences in small-molecule chemotypes that bind RNA and preferences in the RNA motifs that bind small molecules. The screening program increased the dataset of known RNA motif-small molecule binding partners by 20-fold. Analysis of this dataset against the RNA-mediated pathways that regulate VEGFA defined that the microRNA-377 precursor, which represses Vegfa messenger RNA translation, is druggable in a selective manner. We designed TGP-377 to potently and specifically upregulate VEGFA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3ß) is a prominent mediator of the inflammatory response, and high GSK-3 activity is associated with various heart diseases. We investigated the regulatory mechanisms of GSK-3ß in activation of the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in a rat model with successful induction of MI on days 2-28. An in vitro investigation was performed using newborn rat/human cardiomyocytes and fibroblast cultures under typical inflammasome stimulation and hypoxia treatment. GSK-3ß inhibition markedly improved myocardial dysfunction and prevented remodeling, with parallel reduction in the parameters of NLRP3 inflammasome activation after MI. GSK-3ß inhibition reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cardiac fibroblasts, but not in cardiomyocytes. GSK-3ß's interaction with activating signal cointegrator (ASC) as well as GSK-3ß inhibition reduced ASC phosphorylation and oligomerization at the tissues and cellular levels. Taken together, these data show that GSK-3ß directly mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation, causing cardiac dysfunction in MI.","Wang, Shuhui; Su, Xueling; Xu, Lina; Chang, Cheng; Yao, Yu; Komal, Sumra; Cha, Xuexiang; Zang, Mingxi; Ouyang, Xinshou; Zhang, Lirong; Han, Shengna",J. mol. cell. cardiol,602,3

Coronavirus infection causes tissue damage, which triggers the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequent eicosanoid and cytokine storms. Although proinflammatory eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, are critical mediators of physiological processes, such as inflammation, fever, allergy, and pain, their roles in COVID-19 are poorly characterized. Arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids could alleviate the systemic hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 infection by modulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and stimulating the resolution of inflammation. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors, which increase endogenous epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels, exhibit potent anti-inflammatory activity and inhibit various pathologic processes in preclinical disease models, including pulmonary fibrosis, thrombosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, targeting eicosanoids and sEH could be a novel therapeutic approach in combating COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the predominant role of eicosanoids in regulating the inflammatory cascade and propose the potential application of sEH inhibitors in alleviating COVID-19 symptoms. The host-protective action of omega-3 fatty acid-derived epoxyeicosanoids and specialized proresolving mediators in regulating anti-inflammation and antiviral response is also discussed. Future studies determining the eicosanoid profile in COVID-19 patients or preclinical models are pivotal in providing novel insights into coronavirus-host interaction and inflammation modulation.","Hammock, Bruce D; Wang, Weicang; Gilligan, Molly M; Panigrahy, Dipak",Am J Pathol,602,22

We highlight the paucity of updated international recommendations on these subjects and identify gaps that could inform the current evidence base. All available guidance note the need for evidence surrounding the efficacy of these treatments and practices but are also quick to caution against methodological difficulties in the conduct of such evaluations. Evidence suggests that improved evaluation methods on efficacy and effectiveness are crucial toward expanding future research into establishing the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, in the context of shifting acceptance, interest, and integration of traditional medicines into health systems, and as another step toward Universal Health Coverage.","Lin, Lydia Wenxin; Ananthakrishnan, Aparna; Teerawattananon, Yot",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,602,20

Schools in each township of Minhang District, Shanghai, were sampled, and parents in the WeChat group of each school were asked to participate in this cross-sectional Internet-based survey. Parents responded to questions about hesitancy and were given information about five different COVID-19 vaccine candidates, the effectiveness of which varied between 50 and 95% and which had a risk of fever as a side effect between 5 and 20%. Overall, 3673 parents responded to the survey. Almost 90% would accept a vaccine for themselves (89.7%), for their child (87.5%) or for an elderly parent (88.5%) with the most ideal attributes (95% effectiveness with 5% risk of fever). But with the least ideal attributes (50% effectiveness and a 20% risk of fever) these numbers dropped to 33.5%, 31.3%, and 31.8%, respectively. Vaccine hesitancy, age at first child’s birth, and relative income were all significantly related to sensitivity to vaccine safety and effectiveness.

METHODS: Secondary data from notification of laboratory unconfirmed and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the National data system for 41 epidemiological weeks were analysed and compared between oral health professionals (dentist + oral health technicians/assistants) and the general population. The cumulative incidences of COVID-19 were obtained by the ratio of the total number of confirmed cases to the total Brazilian population or the population of oral health professionals registered with the Federal Council of Dentistry and adjusted by age. The incidences were then compared. RESULTS: The age-standardised cumulative incidences were 18.70/1000 for oral health professionals and 17.71/1000 for the population, with a ratio of 1.05.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in the CISDCP were included in this study. The distribution of cases, exposure history, clustered epidemic situation, and clinical manifestations, disease severity, and key time nodes were analyzed. Once the throat swab or sputum sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing as confirmed cases. RESULTS There were 69 cases of COVID-19 that were confirmed between January 22 and February 18, 2020 reported. The onset time was concentrated on January 25, 2020 solstice to February 6, 2020 (71.0%), and the reporting dates were concentrated on January 31, 2020 and February 9, 2020 (69.6%). Nineteen cases (27.5%) had a history of sojourn in Hubei Province, and none of the cases reported after February 6, 2020 had a history of exposure in Hubei Province. There were 14 cluster outbreaks, and human-to-human transmission was the most common (78.6%). The most common symptoms were fever (56.5%), cough (37.7%), and self-conscious discomfort (14.5%). Besides, there were 9 severe cases (13.0%). CONCLUSIONS The epidemic prevention and control in Lu'an City has achieved phased results. Yet, new strict control measures need to be implemented to prevent a further outbreak, especially for those who will return to Lu'an City.","Jiang, Zhenghao; Sun, Jie; Li, Xiude; Lyu, Yong",Med Sci Monit,602,7

During the peak of the pandemic, Australia closed both its state and international borders to all travelers and interstate travel was very tightly regulated. Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were one of the very few primary healthcare workers still serving their communities during these periods of strict lockdown. In this personal view article, the challenges and their toll on the mental health and wellbeing of these ""essential workers"" are described. KEY FINDINGS: Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were under immense pressure to remain open and serve their communities amidst rapidly changing legislation and, at times, conflicting advice from the range of Australian health agencies. Rapid changes to workload and workflow were combined with the dilemma of balancing professional obligations with the personal duty of keeping themselves and their sometimes geographically distant families safe. Fluctuating demands and traumatic situations found community pharmacy staff often feeling distressed and underprepared. SUMMARY: Despite a global pandemic following a season of extraordinary bushfires, it has barely been acknowledged that community pharmacy staff are one of the highest risk groups for long-term psychological impacts. To our knowledge, very little research has addressed the toll of these cataclysmic events on this group of essential healthcare workers.","McCallum, Blake Andrew; Dunkley, Kay; Hotham, Elizabeth; Suppiah, Vijayaprakash",Int J Pharm Pract,602,20

METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28, 2020, about one month (32 days) cross-sectionally after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in São Paulo. The 638 adults were in 25 states out of the 26 Brazilian states, with the only exception being Roraima, the least populated state in the Amazon. Of all the participating adults, 24%, 20%, and 18% of them were located in Rio de Janeiro state, Santa Catarina state, and São Paulo state respectively. RESULTS: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less reported higher levels of distress. Each individual's distance from the Brazilian epicenter of São Paulo interacted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The ""typhoon eye effect"" was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey. CONCLUSION: Identifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to better target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","Zhang, Stephen Xu; Wang, Yifei; Jahanshahi, Asghar Afshar; Li, Jizhen; Schmitt, Valentina Gomes Haensel",J Psychosom Res,602,16

It has become a major cause of concern for health care professionals all over the world. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, awareness and hygiene practices regarding COVID-19 among private dental practitioners practicing in Tricity (Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali) in India during these critical times. Materials and Methods: A total of 245 private dentists participated in this cross-sectional survey and finally 215 constituted the final sample size. A self-administered, multiple choice type questionnaire (verified by a specialist) was administered to obtain information from the subjects. The questionnaire was divided into two parts and included 15 questions on knowledge and awareness regarding COVID-19. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and Student's t-test. Results: Percentage of subjects who answered correctly regarding main symptoms of COVID-19 and primary mode of transmission was 87% and 82.5% respectively. One-third of the subjects were not aware regarding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be used while rendering dental treatment. 75% of subjects were of the opinion that supportive care is the current treatment regime for COVID-19. Less than one-third of subjects (30.2%) reported high scores. Education level (p=0.018) and health sector profile (p=0.024) of the subjects were significantly associated with mean knowledge scores. Conclusion: The findings of the present study showed that some notable deficiencies in knowledge existed among dental professionals regarding some vital aspects of COVID-19. Therefore, there is an urgent need for improving dentists'knowledge via health education and training programs. Further studies on the subject are also warranted once the situation normalizes.","Singh Gambhir, Ramandeep; Singh Dhaliwal, Jagjit; Aggarwal, Amit; Anand, Samir; Anand, Vaibhav; Kaur Bhangu, Amanpreet",Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig,602,16

Empirical studies leveraging such methods when randomization is unethical or impractical have grown in the health sciences in recent years. The adoption of so-called ""causal"" methods to account for both/either measured and/or unmeasured confounders is an important addition to the methodological toolkit for understanding the distribution, progression, and consequences of infectious diseases (IDs) and interventions on IDs. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic and in the absence of systematic randomization of exposures or interventions, the value of these methods is even more apparent. Yet to our knowledge, no studies have assessed how causal methods involving pooling individual-level, observational, longitudinal data are being applied in ID-related research. In this systematic review, we assess how these methods are used and reported in ID-related research over the last 10 years. Findings will facilitate evaluation of trends of causal methods for ID research and lead to concrete recommendations for how to apply these methods where gaps in methodological rigor are identified. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will apply MeSH and text terms to identify relevant studies from EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, Business Source Premier, CINAHL, EconLit with Full Text, PsychINFO), EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science.

Although often asymptomatic, a relevant percentage of affected people can develop severe pneumonia. Initial evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis, as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV. The presence of genome composition features involved in delaying viral recognition is herein investigated for human coronaviruses (HCoVs), with a special emphasis on SARS-CoV-2. A broad collection of HCoVs polyprotein, envelope, matrix, nucleocapsid and spike coding sequences was downloaded and several statistics representative of genome composition and codon bias were investigated. A model able to evaluate and test the presence of a significant under- or over-representation of dinucleotide pairs while accounting for the underlying codon bias and protein sequence was also implemented. The study revealed the significant under-representation of CpG dinucleotide pair in all HcoV, but especially in SARS-CoV and even more in SARS-CoV-2. The presence of forces acting to minimize CpG content was confirmed by relative synonymous codon usage pattern. Codons containing the CpG pair were severely under-represented, primarily in the polyprotein and spike coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a significant under-representation of the TpA pair was observed in the N and S region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Increasing experimental evidence has proven that CpG and TpA are targeted by innate antiviral host defences, contributing both to RNA degradation and RIG-1 mediated interferon production. The low content of these dinucleotides could contribute to a delayed interferon production, dysregulated immune response, higher viral replication and poor outcome. Significantly, the RIG-1 signalling pathway was proven to be defective in elderlies, suggesting a likely interaction between limited viral recognition and lower responsiveness in interferon production that could justify the higher disease severity and mortality in older patients.","Franzo, Giovanni",Sci Rep,602,1

Since DPP4-inhibitors are currently used for the treatment of patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM), there is currently high interest in the possibility that these agents, or incretin-based therapies (IBTs) in general, may be of benefit against the new coronavirus infection. Diabetes is associated with increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, and accumulating evidence suggests that IBTs may favorably alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their inherent mechanisms of action. Further research into prognostic variables associated with various antidiabetic treatment regimens, and in particular the IBT, in patients with T2DM affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is therefore warranted.","Stoian, Anca Pantea; Papanas, Nikolaos; Prazny, Martin; Rizvi, Ali A; Rizzo, Manfredi",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther,602,20

A protocol that limits the resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) to events that are more likely to result in a positive outcome can lower hospital burdens and reduce emergency medical services resources and infection risk, although it would come at the cost of lives lost that could otherwise be saved. Our primary objective was to evaluate candidate OHCA CSC protocols involving known predictors of survival and identify the protocol that results in the smallest resource burden, as measured by the number of hospitalizations required per favorable OHCA outcome achieved. Our secondary objective was to describe the effects of the CSC protocols in terms of health outcomes and other measures of resource burden. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database. Non-traumatic OHCA events from 2018 were included (nâ¯=â¯79,533). Candidate CSC protocols involving combinations of known predictors of good survival for OHCA were applied to the existing dataset to measure the resulting numbers of resuscitation attempts, transportations to hospital, hospital admissions, and favorable neurological outcomes. These outcomes were also assessed under Standard Care, defined as no CSC protocol applied to the data. RESULTS: The CSC protocol with the smallest number of hospitalizations per survivor with a favorable neurological outcome was that an OHCA resuscitation should only be attempted if the arrest was witnessed by emergency medical services or the first monitored rhythm was shockable (number of hospitalizations: 2.26 [95% CI: 2.21-2.31] vs. 3.46 [95% CI: 3.39-3.53] under Standard Care). This rule resulted in significant reductions in resource utilization (46.1% of hospitalizations and 29.2% of resuscitation attempts compared to Standard Care) while still preserving 70.5% of the favorable neurological outcomes under Standard Care. For every favorable neurological outcome lost under this CSC protocol, 6.3 hospital beds were made free that could be used to treat other patients. CONCLUSION: In a pandemic scenario, pre-hospital CSC protocols that might not otherwise be considered have the potential to greatly improve overall survival, and this study provides an evidence-based approach towards selecting such a protocol. As this study was performed using data generated before the COVID-19 pandemic, future studies incorporating pandemic-era data will further help develop evidence-based CSC protocols.","Natalzia, Peter; Murk, William; Thompson, Jeffrey J; Dorsett, Maia; Cushman, Jeremy T; Reed, Philip; Clemency, Brian M",Resuscitation,602,24

The purpose of this study is to characterize the CT findings of 30 children from mainland China who had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although recent American College of Radiology recommendations assert that CT should not be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for patients with suspected COVID-19, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of this disease to identify its presence in patients undergoing CT for other reasons. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed the CT findings and clinical symptoms of 30 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were seen at six centers in China from January 23, 2020, to February 8, 2020. Patient age ranged from 10 months to 18 years. Patients older than 18 years of age or those without chest CT examinations were excluded. Two cardiothoracic radiologists and a cardiothoracic imaging fellow characterized and scored the extent of lung involvement. Cohen kappa coefficient was used to calculate interobserver agreement between the readers. RESULTS. Among children, CT findings were often negative (77%). Positive CT findings seen in children included ground-glass opacities with a peripheral lung distribution, a crazy paving pattern, and the halo and reverse halo signs. There was a correlation between increasing age and increasing severity of findings, consistent with reported symptomatology in children. Eleven of 30 patients (37%) underwent follow-up chest CT, with 10 of 11 examinations (91%) showing no change, raising questions about the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSION. The present study describes the chest CT findings encountered in children with COVID-19 and questions the utility of CT in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients.","Steinberger, Sharon; Lin, Bin; Bernheim, Adam; Chung, Michael; Gao, Yuantong; Xie, Zongyu; Zhao, Tongtong; Xia, Junli; Mei, Xueyan; Little, Brent P",AJR Am J Roentgenol,602,16

We undertook a systematic literature review and comprehensive analysis of a total of 55 articles on arterial and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and articles on previous pandemics with respect to thromboembolism and compared the similarities and differences between them. The presence of thrombosis in multiple organ systems points to thromboembolism being an integral component in the pathogenesis of this disease. Thromboembolism is likely to be the main player in the morbidity and mortality of COVID -19 in which the pulmonary system is most severely affected. We also hypothesize that D-dimer values could be used as an early marker for prognostication of disease as it has been seen to be raised even in the pre-symptomatic stage. This further strengthens the notion that thromboembolism prevention is necessary. We also examined literature on the neurovascular and cardiovascular systems, as the manifestation of thromboembolic phenomenon in these two systems varied, suggesting different pathophysiology of damage. Further research into the role of thromboembolism in COVID-19 is important to advance the understanding of the virus, its effects and to tailor treatment accordingly to prevent further casualties from this pandemic.","Pillai, Presaad; Joseph, Joyce Pauline; Fadzillah, Nurul Huda Mohamad; Mahmod, Masliza",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,602,2

The objectives were to identify critical care drugs required, obtain patient usage data and consider current regional practice to establish the requirement. METHOD: Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts across Northern Ireland (NI) identified critical care drugs required and an estimation of average daily usage data. The Microsoft Excel database was constructed to compile Trust data and establish regional requirement. The database was refined further according to real-world data from NI HSC Trusts, Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre report on COVID-19 in critical care, daily regional COVID-19 figures and other available National data. Components of a tool originally developed for H1N1 and updated for COVID-19 were adapted to reflect the NI context and used in the regional database. The database was clinically reviewed to ensure that it accurately reflected current regional practice given the evolving nature of the pandemic. RESULTS: The critical care drugs required in the pandemic, usage data and current regional practice were identified to establish requirement. A regional database was constructed and used to produce a model for calculating approximate critical drug requirements. The model was used to map critical drug requirements to available stock in Trusts and wholesalers/suppliers, enabling the identification of treatment capacity for these medicines regionally, both currently and for projected surges. Data have also been used in the preparation of weekly regional situation reports provided to both the HSC Board and the Department of Health. CONCLUSION: The process developed is a robust approach to assist in informing regional critical care drug requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further application has been demonstrated in regional procurement planning and preparedness.","Hogg, Anita; Huey, Rachel; Scott, Michael G; Ferguson, Andrew",Eur J Hosp Pharm,602,22

Recent reviews point to its direct relationship with the decline in biodiversity due to habitat destruction or land use changes. When this occurs, some species become extinct, but those that survive and thrive, such as some rodents, are more likely to harbor pathogens that can affect humans. Our research focused on the study of molecular systematics and population genetic structure in rodent hosts of Mammarenavirus and Orthohantavirus affecting humans. From the analysis of phylogenetic relationships in Oligoryzomys and Calomys in South America, we were able to resolve contradictory taxonomic reports, obtaining the following rodent/viral genotype relationships in the endemic areas of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Argentina: Patagonia: O. longicaudatus/Andes;northwestern Argentina: O. occidentalis/Bermejo, O. chacoensis/Oran and C. fecundus/Laguna Negra;Misiones: O. nigripes/Juquitiba;Southern Litoral, Parana River Delta and the coast of the Uruguay River: O. flavescens/Lechiguanas and exceptionally, O. nigripes/Lechiguanas. We also detected the following rodent/mammarenavirus relationships: C. musculinus/Junin, C. venustus and C. fecundus/Latino-like. We observed that, in general, in conserved environments, the abundance of rodents was low although with high species diversity, while in places with greater disturbance, less diversity but a greater abundance of species transmitting zoonoses was found. It is not surprising then that the Argentine hemorrhagic fever endemic area is strongly associated with crops of the Humid Pampas and that HPS endemic areas are located in regions with high deforestation and introduction of crops or invasive exotic species. In times of pandemics, we should think about how diseases arise when our species advances over natural environments.","González-Ittig, R. E.; Rivera, P. C.; Pinotti, J. D.; Ortiz, N.; Martin, M.

We hypothesized that PTX is associated with a higher rate of mortality and is more likely to occur in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) at higher maximal PEEP and with higher levels of markers of inflammation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cohort study of all adult patients (&gt;18 years) with confirmed diagnosed SARS-CoV-19 infection admitted to our medical intensive care units (ICU) between 3/11/2020 and 8/19/2020 at our 2 hospital healthcare system. Exclusion criteria were non-Covid illness resulting in ICU level of care and ICU stay less than 24 hours. Presence or absence of PTX was determined by retrospective review of chest imaging reports. The primary outcome was mortality at discharge. Secondary outcome measures assessed at the p=0.05 level included age, ethnicity, BMI, maximum PEEP on MV and laboratory inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer, LDH, Ferritin). RESULTS: 270 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU. 11 patients were excluded leaving 259 for analysis. PTX was identified in 16 (6.2%). In the entire group, 9 of 16 (56.2%) patients with PTX died in the hospital compared to 68 of 243 (28%) without PTX (p=0.017). There were no significant differences in age, BMI, highest PEEP, or mortality in the subgroup treated with MV. The rate of PTX was significantly lower in the Black population and higher in the Hispanic population (p=0.01). There were no significant differences in the levels of the inflammatory markers for those patients who developed PTX compared to those who did not (CRP p=0.71;D-dimer p=0.11;Ferritin p=0.36;LDH p=0.41). CONCLUSION: PTX occurred in about 6% of COVID-19 patients requiring ICU level of care with most on mechanical ventilation and was significantly associated with a higher rate of mortality for the entire population, but not in the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. PTX frequency was significantly lower in the Black population and higher in the Hispanic population. PTX was not associated with higher PEEP values. The absence of an association with PEEP suggests that barotrauma may not be the etiology of pneumothorax in COVID-19. Age, BMI, and the levels of inflammatory markers were not significantly different in these groups.","Berg, B.; Pajak, A.; Gandhi, P.; Thakur, S.; Al-Mohamad, T.; Liou, J.; Slaby, I.; Arsenault, H.; Vest, M.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to improve the understanding about the sources and content of widely viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Using the keywords ""coronavirus vaccination,"" we searched for relevant YouTube videos, sorted them by view count, and selected two successive samples (with replacement) of the 100 most widely viewed videos in July and December 2020, respectively. Content related to COVID-19 vaccines were coded by two observers, and inter-rater reliability was demonstrated. RESULTS: The videos observed in this study were viewed over 55 million times cumulatively. The number of videos that addressed fear increased from 6 in July to 20 in December 2020, and the cumulative views correspondingly increased from 2.6% (1,449,915 views) to 16.6% (9,553,368 views).

In addition, no directory has been established listing all the apps developed to address the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify smartphone apps designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze their characteristics. METHODS: We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study of all smartphone apps associated with COVID-19. Between April 27 and May 2, 2020, we searched the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) for COVID-19 apps. The search terms used were coronavirus, COVID-19, and SARS-COV-2. The apps were downloaded and evaluated. The variables analyzed were name, platform, country, language, category, cost, update date, size, version, number of downloads, developer, and purpose. Purpose was further classified into the following categories: news, general information, self-diagnosis, contact tracing, notices to contacts, notification of close cases, awareness, helplines, monitoring of clinical parameters, recording of symptoms and treatment, and messaging with health care professionals. RESULTS: We identified 114 apps on the investigated platforms. Of these, 62/114 (54.4%) were on Android and 52/114 (45.6%) were on iOS. Of the 114 apps, 37 (32.5%) were developed in Europe, 32 (28.1%) in Asia, and 30 (26.3%) in North America. The most frequent languages were English (65/114, 57.0%), Spanish (34/114, 29.8%), and Chinese (14/114, 12.3%). The most common categories were health and well-being/fitness apps (41/114, 41.2%) and medicine apps (43/114, 37.7%). Of the 114 apps, 113 (99.1%) were free. The mean time between the date of the analysis and the date of the last update was 11.1 days (SD 11.0). Overall, 95 of the 114 apps (83.3%) were intended for the general population, 99 apps (7.9%) were intended for health professionals, and 3 apps (2.6%) were intended for both. Regarding the type of developer, 64/114 apps (56.1%) were developed by governments; 42/114 (64.1%) were developed by national governments, and 23/114 (35.9%) were developed by regional governments. The apps with the highest number of downloads (100,000+) were developed by governments (P=.13), except for the World Health Organization app (500,000+). The purposes of the apps available in Western languages (107/114, 93.9%) were determined; the most common purposes were general information about COVID-19 (66, 64.0%), COVID-19 news (53, 51.0%), recording of symptoms (53, 51.0%), and contact tracing (51, 47.7%). More than one purpose was identified for 99/107 apps (92.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This paper offers a comprehensive and unique review of all available COVID-19 apps. Governments have adopted these tools during the pandemic, and more than half of the apps were developed by government agencies. The most common purposes of the apps are providing information on the numbers of infected, recovered, and deceased patients, recording of symptoms, and contact tracing.","Collado-Borrell, Roberto; Escudero-Vilaplana, Vicente; Villanueva-Bueno, Cristina; Herranz-Alonso, Ana; Sanjurjo-Saez, Maria",J Med Internet Res,602,22

The influence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medication and IBD itself on COVID-19 is controversial. Additionally, IBD focused guidance is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine COVID-19 prevalence/exposure, perception and information sources, medication compliance, patient behaviour and physician contact among patients with IBD compared with non-IBD controls. METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous survey of patients with IBD (N=415) at one university IBD clinic and one gastroenterology practice, matched 4:1 with control participants (N=116), was performed. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had high fear of infection. The fear was more pronounced in patients taking immunosuppressants and it extended to hospitals, private practices and public places, such as supermarkets. IBD patients reported leaving their homes less frequently than their peers without IBD. A total of 90% of patients with IBD reported washing their hands more frequently. Patients taking immunosuppressants were concerned about interactions between medication and COVID-19, whereas patients taking 5-aminosalicylates were not. Nonetheless, 96.4% of patients adhered to continuing their medication. Patients sought guidance primarily from television and internet news sites. Video consultations were found to be a suitable solution for a subset of patients who are young, have a high level of fear and leave their home less frequently than their peers, whereas overall acceptance of video consultations was limited. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD are significantly more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than their non-IBD peers, but they continue to adhere to their medication regimens. IBD focused COVID-19 information should be actively conveyed.","Grunert, P C; Reuken, P A; Stallhofer, J; Teich, N; Stallmach, A",J. crohns. colitis,602,20

Methods Retrospective analysis was performed utilizing a database of patients evaluated by Kaiser Permanente Southern California sleep medicine between 2015-2020 that includes sleep study data, remotely collected daily PAP data, and electronic health record information. Adult patients were included for analysis if: a) healthplan enrollment was before February 1, 2020;b) as of March 1, 2020 patient was alive and had either sleep diagnostic or PAP data. PAP adherence was calculated between March 1, 2020 to COVID-19 confirmation, death, disenrollment or study end date (July 31, 2020), whichever came earlier. COVID-19 infection rates and all-cause hospitalizations and mortality were evaluated based on OSA status and PAP adherence utilizing these definitions: patients &lt;2 hours/night PAP were considered “untreated” and ≥2 hours/night were “treated”;2-3.9 hours/night were “moderately treated” and ≥4 hours/night were “well treated”. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was used to define OSA severity. Multiple logistic regression evaluated the association of various demographic and clinical factors. Results 81,932 patients (39.8% female, age 54.0±14.9 years, 9.9% Black and 34.5% Hispanic) met inclusion for analysis. 1493 (1.8%) had confirmed COVID-19 infection with 224 (0.3%) hospitalizations and 61 (0.07%) resulting in intensive care or death. “Untreated” OSA (and increasing OSA severity) was associated with higher COVID-19 rate and lower rate when “treated” [No OSA 1.7%;“Untreated” Mild 2%, Moderate 2%, Severe 2.4%, OSA unknown severity 2%;“Treated” 1.4%;p&lt;0.0001]. Stratifying PAP adherence also demonstrated reduced infection rate with greater use [“untreated” 2.1%;“moderately treated” 1.7%, “well treated” 1.3%, No OSA 1.7%;p&lt;0.0001]. Multivariable analysis (See FIGURE) confirmed higher infection rate with OSA versus no OSA [OR 0.82(0.70,0.96)] and the benefit of PAP versus “untreated” [“moderately treated” OR 0.82 (0.65, 1.03);“well treated” OR (0.69 (0.59, 0.80)]. Obesity, higher Charlson Comorbidity score, Black and Hispanic ethnicities, and Medicaid enrollment were also associated with higher infection rates;increasing age was associated with reduced infection rate. Separate multivariable analysis showed dose-response association of OSA severity on infection rate [Mild OR 1.21 (1.01,1.44 95%CI);Moderate-Severe OR 1.27 (1.07,1.51) versus no OSA]. Neither OSA presence nor PAP adherence significantly impacted hospitalization rate nor intensive care/death. Conclusion Significant associations emerged with OSA increasing and PAP therapy reducing COVID-19 infection rate. Findings suggest both biologic and social-behavioral influences while also supporting continued PAP use during the pandemic.

However, PRV infection in humans is rare and to the best of knowledge, PRV has never been isolated from human cases before. METHODS: Four acute encephalitis cases in humans were confirmed as PRV infection based on clinical symptoms, laboratory diagnosis, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and applied for virus isolation. Etiological and genetic characteristics of this PRV human isolate were further determined. RESULTS: The patients manifested respiratory dysfunction and acute neurological symptoms. The mNGS revealed PRV specific nucleotide sequences in patients' CSF samples (7-6198 reads and 0.2446%-80.58% coverage). The PRV envelope glycoprotein B antibody, glycoprotein E antibody, and neutralizing antibody were positively detected. For the first time, a PRV strain, designated hSD-1/2019, was isolated and identified from one CSF sample, and transmission electron microscopy revealed hSD-1/2019 had typical morphology similar to swine PRV. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated that hSD-1/2019 was genetically closest to those PRV variant strains currently circulating in pigs in China, and this strain showed similar etiological characteristics to Chinese PRV variant strains, while different from Chinese classical strain. Moreover, hSD-1/2019 showed high pathogenicity and induced acute neurological symptoms in pigs. CONCLUSIONS: A PRV strain was isolated from an acute human encephalitis case. This isolate showed close phylogenetic relationships and similar etiological characteristics to Chinese PRV variant strains, implying the great risk of PRV transmission from pigs to humans.","Liu, Qingyun; Wang, Xiaojuan; Xie, Caihua; Ding, Shifang; Yang, Hongna; Guo, Shibang; Li, Jixuan; Qin, Lingzhi; Ban, Fuguo; Wang, Dongfang; Wang, Cui; Feng, Lingxiao; Ma, Haichang; Wu, Bin; Zhang, Liping; Dong, Changxian; Xing, Li; Zhang, Jiewen; Chen, Huanchun; Yan, Ruoqian; Wang, Xiangru; Li, Wei",,602,9

We also wish to evaluate the possible horizontal transmission after hospital discharge, by means of a follow-up of all the newborns included at 1 month of age. METHODS: This multicenter descriptive study involved 16 Spanish hospitals. We reviewed the medical records of 242 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 13 to May 31, 2020, when they were in their third trimester of pregnancy. They and their 248 newborn infants were monitored until the infant was 1 month old. RESULTS: Caesarean sections (C-sections) were performed on 63 (26%) women. The initial clinical symptoms were coughing (33%) and fever (29.7%). Mothers hospitalized due to COVID-19 pathology had a higher risk of ending their pregnancy via C-section (P = 0.027). Newborns whose mothers had been admitted due to their COVID-19 infection had a higher risk of premature delivery (P = 0.006). We admitted 115 (46.3%) newborn infants to the neonatal unit, of those, 87 (75.6%) were only admitted due to organizational circumstances. No infants died and no vertical or horizontal transmission was detected. Regarding type of feeding, 41.7% of the newborns received exclusive breast-feeding at discharge and 40.4% at 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect COVID-19 transmission during delivery or throughout the first month of life in the newborns included in our study. Exclusive breast-feeding rates at discharge and at 1 month of age were lower than expected.","Marín Gabriel, Miguel A; Reyne Vergeli, Mar; Caserío Carbonero, Sonia; Sole, Laia; Carrizosa Molina, Tamara; Rivero Calle, Irene; Cuadrado Pérez, Irene; Álvarez Fernández, Blanca; Forti Buratti, Azul; Fernández-Cañadas Morillo, Aurora",Pediatr Infect Dis J,602,26

We bring lower and upper bounds on the number of tests required in both the adaptive and the non-adaptive deterministic settings given an upper bound $D$ on the defectives number. For the adaptive deterministic settings, our results show that, any algorithm for estimating the defectives number up to a multiplicative factor of $\Delta$ must make at least $\Omega \left((D/\Delta^2)\log (n/D) \right )$ tests. This extends the same lower bound achieved in \cite{ALA17} for non-adaptive algorithms. Moreover, we give a polynomial time adaptive algorithm that shows that our bound is tight up to a small additive term. For non-adaptive algorithms, an upper bound of $O((D/\Delta^2)$ $(\log (n/D)+\log \Delta) )$ is achieved by means of non-constructive proof. This improves the lower bound $O((\log D)/(\log\Delta))D\log n)$ from \cite{ALA17} and matches the lower bound up to a small additive term. In addition, we study polynomial time constructive algorithms. We use existing polynomial time constructible \emph{expander regular bipartite graphs}, \emph{extractors} and \emph{condensers} to construct two polynomial time algorithms. The first algorithm makes $O((D^{1+o(1)}/\Delta^2)\cdot \log n)$ tests, and the second makes $(D/\Delta^2)\cdot quazipoly$ $(\log n)$ tests.

Germline development defective 2 (GLD-2) is among the first reported cytoplasmic non-canonical PAPs that promotes the translation of germline-specific mRNAs by extending their short poly(A) tails in metazoan, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus. On the other hand, the function of mammalian GLD-2 seems more diverse, which includes monoadenylation of certain microRNAs. To understand the structural basis that underlies the difference between mammalian and non-mammalian GLD-2 proteins, we determine crystal structures of two rodent GLD-2s. Different from C. elegans GLD-2, mammalian GLD-2 is an intrinsically robust PAP with an extensively positively charged surface. Rodent and C. elegans GLD-2s have a topological difference in the ß-sheet region of the central domain. Whereas C. elegans GLD-2 prefers adenosine-rich RNA substrates, mammalian GLD-2 can work on RNA oligos with various sequences. Coincident with its activity on microRNAs, mammalian GLD-2 structurally resembles the mRNA and miRNA processor terminal uridylyltransferase 7 (TUT7). Our study reveals how GLD-2 structurally evolves to a more versatile nucleotidyltransferase, and provides important clues in understanding its biological function in mammals.","Ma, Xiao-Yan; Zhang, Hong; Feng, Jian-Xiong; Hu, Jia-Li; Yu, Bing; Luo, Li; Cao, Yu-Lu; Liao, Shuang; Wang, Jichang; Gao, Song",Nucleic acids res,602,22

In 2019, an unprecedented epidemic of measles affected Samoa, requiring a state of emergency to be declared. Measles causes an immune amnesia which can persist for over 2 years after acute infection and increases the risk of a range of other infections. METHODS: We modelled the potential impact of measles-induced immune amnesia on a COVID-19 epidemic in Samoa using data on measles incidence in 2018-2019, population data and a hypothetical COVID-19 epidemic. RESULTS: The young population structure and contact matrix in Samoa results in the most transmission occurring in young people < 20 years old. The highest rate of death is the 60+ years old, but a smaller peak in death may occur in younger people, with more than 15% of total deaths in the age group under 20 years old. Measles induced immune amnesia could increase the total number of cases by 8% and deaths by more than 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Samoa, which had large measles epidemics in 2019-2020 should focus on rapidly achieving high rates of measles vaccination and enhanced surveillance for COVID-19, as the impact may be more severe due to measles-induced immune paresis. This applies to other severely measles-affected countries in the Pacific, Europe and elsewhere.","MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Costantino, Valentina; Heslop, David J",BMC Infect Dis,602,3

Vaccine hesitant/resistant respondents in Ireland and the UK differed on a number of sociodemographic and health-related variables but were similar across a broad array of psychological constructs. In both populations, those resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to obtain information about the pandemic from traditional and authoritative sources and had similar levels of mistrust in these sources compared to vaccine accepting respondents.

Following a common viral pneumonia, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome sometimes occurs, including an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) carrying a high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and generally develop a mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have been recently described. Both clinical symptoms (i.e., high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctivitis and dry cracked lips) and biological signs (e.g., elevated CRP/PCT, hyperferritinemia) resembled Kawasaki disease. In most instances, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved the cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. However, adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g., anti-IL-1Ra, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm. Thus, a new 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2' has been recently described in children and helps to better understand Kawasaki disease pathophysiology.","Mercier, J-C; Maroni, A; Levy, M; Melki, I; Meinzer, U; Gaschignard, J; Beyler, C; Santos, A",Bull. acad. natl. med,602,1

However, there exists no publicly-available and large-scale CT data to train accurate models. In this work, we propose a multi-stage attentive transfer learning framework for improving COVID-19 diagnosis. Our proposed framework consists of three stages to train accurate diagnosis models through learning knowledge from multiple source tasks and data of different domains. Importantly, we propose a novel self-supervised learning method to learn multi-scale representations for lung CT images. Our method captures semantic information from the whole lung and highlights the functionality of each lung region for better representation learning. The method is then integrated to the last stage of the proposed transfer learning framework to reuse the complex patterns learned from the same CT images. We use a base model integrating self-attention (ATTNs) and convolutional operations. Experimental results show that networks with ATTNs induce greater performance improvement through transfer learning than networks without ATTNs. This indicates attention exhibits higher transferability than convolution. Our results also show that the proposed self-supervised learning method outperforms several baseline methods.","Liu, Yi; Ji, Shuiwang",,602,6

However, the role of RRBP1 in bladder cancer is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of RRBP1 and its influence on cell proliferation in bladder cancer. Methods: Quantification real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the expression levels of RRBP1 in 138 bladder cancer and matched adjacent normal bladder tissues. Then, the clinical significance of RRBP1 in bladder cancer was evaluated. The effect of RRBP1 on cell proliferation and its potential mechanism were further explored. Results: Results show that the mRNA levels of RRBP1 in bladder cancer were significantly higher compared with those in normal tissues (P< 0.001). IHC results show the high-expression rate of RRBP1 in bladder cancer was 68.8%, which was significantly greater than those in normal tissues (40.6%, P< 0.001). RRBP1 high-expression was significantly associated with differentiation, T stage and lymph node metastasis in bladder cancer (P< 0.05). The overall survival time of patients with RRBP1 high-expression was significantly reduced compared to those with RRBP1 low-expression. Moreover, RRBP1 overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation, which was correlated with Smad1/Smad3/TGF-ß1 signal pathway. Conclusion: RRBP1 high-expression correlates with prognosis and promotes cell proliferation in bladder cancer, which could be a potential biomarker.","Lv, Shuang-Wu; Shi, Zhen-Guo; Wang, Xiao-Hui; Zheng, Peng-Yi; Li, Hui-Bing; Han, Qing-Jiang; Li, Zhi-Jun",Onco Targets Ther,602,1

Starting from first principles, we show when the incomplete-data generating process is ignorable for the purpose of Bayesian inference for the parameters of the population model. We demonstrate the semiparametric modeling framework by simulations and an application to the partially observed MERS epidemic in South Korea in 2015. We conclude with an extended discussion of open questions and directions for future research.","Schweinberger, Michael; Bomiriya, Rashmi P.; Babkin, Sergii",,602,20

OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of COVID-19-related critical illness, including trends in outcomes and care delivery. DESIGN: Single-health system, multihospital retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 5 hospitals within the University of Pennsylvania Health System. PATIENTS: Adults with COVID-19-related critical illness who were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure or shock during the initial surge of the pandemic. MEASUREMENTS: The primary exposure for outcomes and care delivery trend analyses was longitudinal time during the pandemic. The primary outcome was all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause death at any time, receipt of mechanical ventilation (MV), and readmissions. RESULTS: Among 468 patients with COVID-19-related critical illness, 319 (68.2%) were treated with MV and 121 (25.9%) with vasopressors. Outcomes were notable for an all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality rate of 29.9%, a median ICU stay of 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 17 days), a median hospital stay of 13 days (IQR, 7 to 25 days), and an all-cause 30-day readmission rate (among nonhospice survivors) of 10.8%. Mortality decreased over time, from 43.5% (95% CI, 31.3% to 53.8%) to 19.2% (CI, 11.6% to 26.7%) between the first and last 15-day periods in the core adjusted model, whereas patient acuity and other factors did not change. LIMITATION: Single-health system study; use of, or highly dynamic trends in, other clinical interventions were not evaluated, nor were complications. CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19-related critical illness admitted to ICUs of a learning health system in the United States, mortality seemed to decrease over time despite stable patient characteristics. Further studies are necessary to confirm this result and to investigate causal mechanisms.

Before evaluating the efficacy and safety of this novel therapeutic strategy in humans, its characterization is required. The developed 65° ethanol formulation is stable at room temperature and protected from light for 15 days, maintaining its physicochemical and microbiological properties. Two oxygen flows have been tested for its administration (2 and 3 L/min) using an automated headspace gas chromatographic analysis technique (HS-GC-MS), with that of 2 L/min being the most appropriate one, ensuring the inhalation of an ethanol daily dose of 33.6 ± 3.6 mg/min and achieving more stable concentrations during the entire treatment (45 min). Under these conditions of administration, the formulation has proven to be safe, based on histological studies of the respiratory tracts and lungs of rats. On the other hand, these results are accompanied by the first preclinical molecular imaging study with radiolabeled ethanol administered by this route. The current ethanol formulation has received approval from the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices for a phase II clinical trial for early-stage COVID-19 patients, which is currently in the recruitment phase (ALCOVID-19; EudraCT number: 2020-001760-29).","Castro-Balado, Ana; Mondelo-García, Cristina; Barbosa-Pereira, Letricia; Varela-Rey, Iria; Novo-Veleiro, Ignacio; Vázquez-Agra, Néstor; Antúnez-López, José Ramón; Bandín-Vilar, Enrique José; Sendón-García, Raquel; Busto-Iglesias, Manuel; Rodríguez-Bernaldo de Quirós, Ana; García-Quintanilla, Laura; González-Barcia, Miguel; Zarra-Ferro, Irene; Otero-Espinar, Francisco J; Rey-Bretal, David; Lago-Quinteiro, José Ramón; Valdés-Cuadrado, Luis; Rábade-Castedo, Carlos; Del Río-Garma, María Carmen; Crespo-Diz, Carlos; Delgado-Sánchez, Olga; Aguiar, Pablo; Barbeito-Castiñeiras, Gema; Pérez Del Molino-Bernal, María Luisa; Trastoy-Pena, Rocío; Passannante, Rossana; Llop, Jordi; Pose-Reino, Antonio; Fernández-Ferreiro, Anxo",,602,24

The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of reinfection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Simulations of the cumulative number of active cases (including those with comorbidity), at different reinfection rates, show infection peaks reducing with decreasing reinfection of those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. In addition, optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the strategy that prevents COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID-19.","Omame, Andrew; Sene, Ndolane; Nometa, Ikenna; Nwakanma, Cosmas I; Nwafor, Emmanuel U; Iheonu, Nneka O; Okuonghae, Daniel",,602,20

We obtained 711 OXC samples from 618 patients with epilepsy who were enrolled in the Epilepsy Registry Cohort of Seoul National University Hospital from February 2011 to January 2014. The plasma PK model was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effect modelling method with NONMEM (ver 7.3). A one-compartment model with a first-order absorption model and proportional residual error adequately described the MHD concentration-time profiles. The only covariate incorporated for CL/F and V/F was body weight. Of the 447 patients analysed, 28 (6.26%) had dose-related adverse events (DRAEs), which were dizziness, somnolence, headache, and diplopia. For DRAE occurrence, the cut-off values of the MHD trough and AUC were 12.27 mg/L (specificity 0.570, sensitivity 0.643) and 698.5 mg h/L (specificity, sensitivity 0.571), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed the sole dizziness symptom was significantly associated with both the MHD trough and the AUC (p = 0.013, p = 0.038, respectively).

However, in some cases, moderate and severe symptoms have been observed with pneumonia. Many companies are developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates using different technologies that are classified into four groups (intact target viruses, proteins, viral vectors and nucleic acids). For rapid development, RNA vaccines and adenovirus vector vaccines have been urgently approved, and their injection has already started across the world. These types of vaccine technologies have been developed over more than 20 years using translational research for use against cancer or diseases caused by genetic disorders but the COVID-19 vaccines are the first licensed drugs to prevent infectious diseases using RNA vaccine technology. Although these vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 for a short period, safety and efficiency evaluations should be continuously monitored over a long time period.

Many computational methods have been proposed to predict disease-related genes, but how to make full use of multi-source biological data to enhance the ability of disease-gene prediction is still challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for predicting disease-related genes by using fast network embedding (PrGeFNE), which can integrate multiple types of associations related to diseases and genes. Specifically, we first constructed a heterogeneous network by using phenotype-disease, disease-gene, protein-protein and gene-GO associations; and low-dimensional representation of nodes is extracted from the network by using a fast network embedding algorithm. Then, a dual-layer heterogeneous network was reconstructed by using the low-dimensional representation, and a network propagation was applied to the dual-layer heterogeneous network to predict disease-related genes. Through cross-validation and newly added-association validation, we displayed the important roles of different types of association data in enhancing the ability of disease-gene prediction, and confirmed the excellent performance of PrGeFNE by comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we developed a web tool that can facilitate researchers to search for candidate genes of different diseases predicted by PrGeFNE, along with the enrichment analysis of GO and pathway on candidate gene set. This may be useful for investigation of diseases' molecular mechanisms as well as their experimental validations.

Materials & methods: Two artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were adopted: a multilayer feed-forward network (MLFFNN) and a nonlinear autoregressive network with eXogenous inputs (NARX). Data on the incidence of the four most common tumors (breast, colorectal, lung and prostate) from 1992 to 2016 (available from National Cancer Institute online datasets) were used for training and validation, and data until 2050 were predicted. Results: The rapid decreasing trend of prostate cancer incidence started in 2010 will continue until 2018-2019; it will then slow down and reach a plateau after 2050, with several differences among ethnicities. The incidence of breast cancer will reach a plateau in 2030, whereas colorectal cancer incidence will reach a minimum value of 35 per 100,000 in 2030.

In this study, we have employed virtual screening approaches and selected 415 lead-like compounds from 103 million chemical substances, based on the existing drugs, from PubChem databases as potential candidates for the S protein-mediated viral attachment inhibition. Thereafter, based on drug-likeness and Lipinski's rules, 44 lead-like compounds were docked within the active side pocket of the viral-host attachment site of the S protein. Corresponding ligand properties and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile were measured. Furthermore, four novel inhibitors were designed and assessed computationally for efficacy. Comparative analysis showed the screened compounds in this study maintain better results than the proposed mother compounds, VE607 and SSAA09E2. The four designed novel lead compounds possessed more fascinating output without deviating from any of Lipinski's rules. They also showed higher bioavailability and the drug-likeness score was 0.56 and 1.81 compared with VE607 and SSAA09E2, respectively. All the screened compounds and novel compounds showed promising ADMET properties. Among them, the compound AMTM-02 was the best candidate, with a docking score of -7.5 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the binding study was verified by molecular dynamics simulation over 100 ns by assessing the stability of the complex. The proposed screened compounds and the novel compounds may give some breakthroughs for the development of a therapeutic drug to treat SARS-CoV-2 proficiently in vitro and in vivo.","Oany, Arafat Rahman; Mia, Mamun; Pervin, Tahmina; Junaid, Md; Hosen, S M Zahid; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Int J Antimicrob Agents,602,23

In addition to shortages, qualitative fit testing can have low sensitivity for detecting poor fit, leading to inconsistent protection. Multiple groups have developed alternative solutions such as modified snorkel masks to overcome these limitations, but validation of these solutions has been lacking. We sought to determine if N95s and snorkel masks with attached high-efficiency filters provide consistent protection levels in healthcare workers and if the addition of positive pressure via an inexpensive powered-air purifying respirator to the snorkel mask would provide enhanced protection. Fifty-one healthcare workers who were qualitatively fitted with N95 masks underwent quantitative mask fit testing according to a simulated workplace exercise protocol. N95, snorkel masks with high-efficiency filters and snorkel masks with powered-air purifying respirators were tested. Respiratory filtration ratios were collected for each step and averaged to obtain an overall workplace protocol fit factor. Failure was defined as either an individual filtration ratio or an overall fit factor below 100. N95s and snorkel masks with high-efficiency filters failed one or more testing steps in 59% and 20% of participants, respectively, and 24% and 12% failed overall fit factors, respectively. The snorkel masks with powered-air purifying respirators had zero individual or overall failures.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) registered in our rheumatology clinic were assessed during their routine outpatient follow-up control or contacted via phone between July and December 2020. Patients' demographics, diagnosis, medication, comorbidities, frequency of going outside during the pandemic, work status, whether patients could attend their routine follow-up, treatment changes, access to drugs during the pandemic, and the incidence of Covid-19 infection were collected. RESULTS: A total of 320 patients with IRD were analysed; 114 (35.6%) patients were treated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) (methotrexate/leflunomide/sulfasalazine), 93 (29.1%) patients with biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), 113 (35.3%) patients with glucocorticoids, and 103 (32.2%) patients with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). A total of 15.9% of patients on HCQ experienced problems in medication supply. Only 87 (27.2%) patients presented for their routine follow-up appointment, and 38 (11.9%) of the patients changed their treatment without professional health advice. While 53 (57%) patients on biological agents continued their treatment, 31 patients (33.3%) interrupted the treatment with doctor's recommendation and 9 patients (9.6%) on their initiative, and 23 of these 31 patients had to restart treatment because of disease activation. The nasopharyngeal swab collected from 30 patients with a suspected Covid-19 contact but without any symptoms was negative. In total, there were 33 patients diagnosed with Covid-19; none of whom had severe respiratory complications or death. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with rheumatic diseases are left without disease monitoring during the pandemic. There was no increased risk of severe Covid-19 infection among patients with IRD.","Batibay, Sevilay; Koçak Ulucaköy, Rezan; Özdemir, Baki; Günendi, Zafer; Gögüs, Feride Nur",Int J Clin Pract,602,16

Continued respiratory protective measures such as social distancing and the wearing of masks have been extensively accepted by the public in most countries. A point worth noticing is that the activities of influenza and other respiratory diseases have decreased as these strategies have been implemented. Public mobilization and large-scale campaigns to promote health are also important to interrupting the transmission of pathogens. A good example can be found in the achievements of China's Patriotic Public Health Campaign.

In the culture sector, this shift has made a large pool of previously inaccessible content available mostly in the form of archival material from cultural events and performances. Although in the past digital did not automatically mean more inclusive, as restrictions to access of cultural content were posed by copyright legislation, institutional policies or the resistance to the digital turn, with this abundant and almost unlimited offer of online content suddenly the discussion of obstacles in access has come to a halt. Our contribution looks into these developments focusing on high-profile cultural (e.g. national theatres, opera houses and concert halls) and audio-visual (AV) institutions with a public interest (e.g. Public Service Broadcasters and AV archives) in the European Union area. We are looking into policy aspects from an institutional perspective and focus on developments particularly vis-a-vis AV media policy and copyright policy. We argue this momentum is a unique opportunity to remember and reconsider policy objectives for an open, democratic and European AV cultural content. We identify this new reality and the implications it brings forward for the existing policies as well as the challenges and opportunities it holds for the AV culture sector, and identify possible policy directions and measures. We urge for the interpretation of broad and flexible exceptions and limitations to copyright for online access to cultural content while transposing the DSM Directive into national laws, and for a focused and coordinated effort related to the regulation of large online video sharing platforms enabled by the new AVMSD, involving such platforms in the financing, distribution and visibility of European AV content.","Kolokytha, O.; Rozgonyi, K.",Journal of Digital Media &amp; Policy,602,1

Human milk, containing antibodies against syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may serve as means of protection through passive immunization. We aimed to determine the presence and pseudovirus neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in human milk of mothers who recovered from COVID-19, and the effect of pasteurization on these antibodies. METHODS: This prospective case control study included lactating mothers, recovered from (suspected) COVID-19 and healthy controls. Human milk and serum samples were collected. To assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies we used multiple complementary assays, namely ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (specific for IgA and IgG), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) protein for IgG in serum, and bridging ELISA with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and N protein for specific Ig (IgG, IgM and IgA in human milk and serum). To assess the effect of pasteurization, human milk was exposed to Holder (HoP) and High Pressure Pasteurization (HPP). RESULTS: Human milk contained abundant SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 83% of the proven cases and in 67% of the suspected cases. Unpasteurized milk with and without these antibodies was found to be capable of neutralizing a pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 in (97% and 85% of the samples respectively). After pasteurization, total IgA antibody levels were affected by HoP, while SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels were affected by HPP. Pseudovirus neutralizing capacity of the human milk samples was only retained with the HPP approach. No correlation was observed between milk antibody levels and neutralization capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Human milk from recovered COVID-19-infected mothers contains SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies which maintained neutralization capacity after HPP. All together this may represent a safe and effective immunization strategy after HPP.","van Keulen, Britt J; Romijn, Michelle; Bondt, Albert; Dingess, Kelly A; Kontopodi, Eva; van der Straten, Karlijn; den Boer, Maurits A; Burger, Judith A; Poniman, Meliawati; Bosch, Berend J; Brouwer, Philip J M; de Groot, Christianne J M; Hoek, Max; Li, Wentao; Pajkrt, Dasja; Sanders, Rogier W; Schoonderwoerd, Anne; Tamara, Sem; Timmermans, Rian A H; Vidarsson, Gestur; Stittelaar, Koert J; Rispens, Theo T; Hettinga, Kasper A; van Gils, Marit J; Heck, Albert J R; van Goudoever, Johannes B",Nutrients,602,16

Oncology nurse burnout is likely to be an increasingly significant issue for cancer services as the true cost of the pandemic is revealed. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers are reported widely, inevitably leading to poor prognosis and more aggressive treatments for patients. Gaining a better understanding of oncology nurse burnout, its prevalence and causes as well as strategies to reduce or prevent it will help to improve patient care and support staff wellbeing during and after the pandemic. Methodology: A search of the literature related to oncology nurse burnout, covering North America and Europe over 5 years (August 2014-January 2020), resulted in 31 articles for review. None of the studies were carried out in the UK, suggesting a need for robust investigations into oncology nurse burnout in the British health service. Summary: The prevalence of burnout among oncology nurses before the COVID-19 outbreak appeared to be high and is likely to have increased as a result of the pandemic. However, the studies investigating oncology nurse burnout are small and cross-sectional, with low-quality methods. The literature suggests the major causes of burnout arise in the workplace, particularly aspects of the environment that prevent nurses from working according to their values. Although burnout is frequently attributed to workplace factors, interventions remain focused on individuals' coping mechanisms and rarely on the workplace factors that are known to cause it.","Nwanya, Melanie; Rowberry, Deborah",Br J Nurs,602,13

AIM OF STUDY: In the clinical studies, FFYH was very effective for the treatment of influenza, but the mechanism of action against influenza A virus remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effect of FFYH against influenza A virus in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was investigated for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CPE inhibition assay and HA assay were used to evaluate the in vitro antiviral effects of FFYH against influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2. Mice were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of FFYH in vivo with ribavirin and lianhuaqingwen as positive controls. RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA transcription of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IP10, and IL-1ß mRNA. ELISA was used to examine the expression of inflammatory factors such as TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IP10, and IL-1ß in sera. The blood parameters were analyzed with auto hematology analyzer. Moreover, the potential mechanism of FFYH against influenza A virus in vivo was also investigated. RESULTS: FFYH showed a broad-spectrum of antiviral activity against H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 influenza A viruses. Furthermore, FFYH dose-dependently increased the survival rate, significantly prolonged the median survival time of mice, and markedly reduced lung injury caused by influenza A virus. Also, FFYH significantly improve the sick signs, food taken, weight loss, blood parameters, lung index, and lung pathological changes. Moreover, FFYH could markedly inhibit the inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IP10, IL-10, and IL-1ß mRNA or protein via inhibition of the TLR7/MyD88/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway in vivo. CONCLUSION: FFYH not only showed a broad-spectrum of anti-influenza virus activity in vitro, but also exhibited a significant protective effect against lethal influenza virus infection in vivo.

The starting point of deviations is considered as a departure from the approved norms of communication in educational system, which leads to such phenomena as trolling, gaming, etc. The influence of virtualization of education on the rethinking of the norms and practices of communication by young people is considered, and the educational space itself, due to its greater openness, becomes a platform for the implementation of these deviant practices.

However, recent in vivo radioligand binding studies and large-scale transcriptomics in post-mortem brain report reduced markers of microglial inflammation. The findings suggest a contrary hypothesis; that microglia are diverted into their non-inflammatory synaptic remodelling phenotype that interferes with neurodevelopment and perhaps contributes to the relapsing nature of schizophrenia. Recent discoveries on the regulatory interactions between micro- and astroglial cells and immune regulatory T cells (Tregs) cohere with clinical omics data to suggest that: i) disinhibited astrocytes mediate the shift in microglial phenotype via the production of transforming growth factor-beta, which also contributes to the disturbances of dopamine and GABA function in schizophrenia, and ii) systemically impaired functioning of Treg cells contributes to the dysregulation of glial function, the low-grade peripheral inflammation, and the hitherto unexplained predisposition to auto-immunity and reduced life-expectancy in schizophrenia, including greater COVID-19 mortality.","Corsi-Zuelli, Fabiana; Deakin, Bill",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,602,29

The extent to which these interactions, as well as traditional face-to-face interactions, satisfied psychological needs and supported wellbeing during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be elucidated. In this study, university students' social interactions (both technology-based and face-to-face), psychological needs, and wellbeing were assessed at six time points across four months of government-enforced restrictions in Australia. DESIGN: Repeated survey assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Basic psychological need satisfaction; general wellbeing. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that, at the within-subjects level, relatedness satisfaction (feeling understood by, cared for, and connected to others) significantly mediated the relationship between technology-based interaction and wellbeing. Autonomy satisfaction (self-initiation and feeling ownership over decisions and behaviours) mediated the relationship between face-to-face interactions and wellbeing at the within-person level. CONCLUSION: Discussion is centred on the importance of technology-based interactions for needs satisfaction and wellbeing during periods of social isolation.","Dimmock, James; Krause, Amanda E; Rebar, Amanda; Jackson, Ben",Psychol Health,602,10

We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and evaluated risk factors for seroconversion during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we recruited Geneva University Hospitals employees and sampled them 3 times, every 3 weeks from March 30 to June 12, 2020. We measured the proportion of seroconverted employees and determined prevalence ratios of risk factors for seroconversion using multivariate mixed-effects Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 3,421 participants (29% of all employees) were included, with 92% follow-up. The proportion of seroconverted employees increased from 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7%-5.1%) at baseline to 8.5% [(95% CI, 7.6%-9.5%) at the last visit. The proportions of seroconverted employees working in COVID-19 geriatrics and rehabilitation (G&R) wards (32.3%) and non-COVID-19 G&R wards (12.3%) were higher compared to office workers (4.9%) at the last visit. Only nursing assistants had a significantly higher risk of seroconversion compared to office workers (11.7% vs 4.9%; P = .006). Significant risk factors for seroconversion included the use of public transportation (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.25-2.03), known community exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (2.80; 95% CI, 2.22-3.54), working in a ward with a nosocomial COVID outbreak (2.93; 95% CI, 2.27-3.79), and working in a COVID-19 G&R ward (3.47; 95% CI, 2.45-4.91) or a non-COVID-19 G&R ward (1.96; 95% CI, 1.46-2.63). We observed an association between reported use of respirators and lower risk of seroconversion (0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96). CONCLUSION: Additional preventive measures should be implemented to protect employees in G&R wards.

Right-sided endocarditis has lower complication rates than left-sided endocarditis. Common complications are multiple septic pulmonary embolisms, haemoptysis, and acute renal failure. Risk factors associated with right-sided infective endocarditis are commonly related to intravenous drug abuse, central venous catheters, or infections due to implantable cardiac devices. However, patients with congenital ventricular septal defects might be at high risk of endocarditis and haemodynamic complications. CASE PRESENTATION: In the following, we present the case of a 23-year-old man without a previous intravenous drug history with tricuspid valve Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis complicated by acute renal failure and haemoptysis caused by multiple pulmonary emboli. In most cases, right-sided endocarditis is associated with several common risk factors, such as intravenous drug abuse, a central venous catheter, or infections due to implantable cardiac devices. In this case, we found a small perimembranous ventricular septal defect corresponding to a type 2 Gerbode defect. This finding raised the suspicion of a congenital ventricular septal defect complicated by a postendocarditis aneurysmal transformation. CONCLUSIONS: Management of the complications of right-sided infective endocarditis requires a multidisciplinary approach. Echocardiographic approaches should include screening for ventricular septal defects in patients without common risk factors for tricuspid valve endocarditis. Patients with undiagnosed congenital ventricular septal defects are at high risk of infective endocarditis. Therefore, endocarditis prophylaxis after dental procedures and/or soft-tissue infections is highly recommended. An acquired ventricular septal defect is a very rare complication of infective endocarditis. Surgical management of small ventricular septal defects without haemodynamic significance is still controversial.","Hellwege, Rubi Stephani; Gawaz, Meinrad",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,602,1

Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. METHOD: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. RESULTS: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine.

However, the symptoms of the disease and the clinical outcome are very different in infected people. In view of these differences, it is clearly apparent that to gain insight into the biology of the SARS-CoV-2, it is important to study not just the infectious particle in itself but also to investigate the virus-host cell interactions that occur during infection.

METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study using national Veterans Affairs data. Among non-deceased individuals on January 1, 2020 who received VA care in 2019, we matched RA to non-RA patients (1:1) on age, sex, and VA site. COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 (hospitalization or death) were obtained from a national VA COVID-19 surveillance database through December 10, 2020. We used multivariable Cox models to compare the risk of COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization or death after adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, health behaviors, and county level COVID-19 incidence rates. RESULTS: RA and non-RA patients (n=33,886 each) were male predominant (84.5%) and had a mean age of 67.8 years. During follow-up, there were 1,503 COVID-19 diagnoses, 388 severe COVID-19 cases, and 228 non-COVID-19 related deaths. After multivariable adjustment, RA was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25 [95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.39]) and COVID-19 hospitalization or death (HR 1.35 [1.10, 1.66]). DMARDs and prednisone, but not RA autoantibody seropositivity, as well as black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and several chronic conditions were associated with COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization or death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RA are at higher risk for COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization or death than non-RA. With a COVID-19 risk that approaches other recognized chronic conditions, these findings suggest RA patients should be prioritized for COVID-19 prevention and management.","England, Bryant R; Roul, Punyasha; Yang, Yangyuna; Kalil, Andre C; Michaud, Kaleb; Thiele, Geoffrey M; Sauer, Brian C; Baker, Joshua F; Mikuls, Ted R",Arthritis rheumatol.

Herein we demonstrated that lungs originated from different types of PF patients including coronavirus disease 2019, systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and mice following bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF are characterized by the altered methyl-CpG-binding domain 2 (MBD2) expression in macrophages. Depletion of Mbd2 in macrophages protected mice against BLM-induced PF. Mbd2 deficiency significantly attenuated transforming growth factor ß1 (TGF-ß1) production and reduced M2 macrophage accumulation in the lung following BLM induction. Mechanistically, Mbd2 selectively bound to the Ship promoter in macrophages, by which it repressed Ship expression and enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling to promote macrophage M2 program. Therefore, intratracheal administration of liposomes loaded with Mbd2 siRNA protected mice from BLM-induced lung injuries and fibrosis. Together, our data support that MBD2 could be a viable target against pulmonary fibrosis in clinical settings.","Wang, Yi; Zhang, Lei; Wu, Guo-Rao; Zhou, Qing; Yue, Huihui; Rao, Li-Zong; Yuan, Ting; Mo, Biwen; Wang, Fa-Xi; Chen, Long-Min; Sun, Fei; Song, Jia; Xiong, Fei; Zhang, Shu; Yu, Qilin; Yang, Ping; Xu, Yongjian; Zhao, Jianping; Zhang, Huilan; Xiong, Weining; Wang, Cong-Yi",Sci.

This virus genotype, called C-type SARS-CoV-2, was almost exclusively prevalent in the United States from March to July 2020. This type of virus, characterized by a pair of the C17747T (P504L) and A17858G (Y541C) mutations on the nsp13 gene, had never been highly prevalent at any other time or in any other part of the world. In the U.S., Washington State was the center of the epidemic, and the C-type viruses, along with the viruses with wild-type helicase, seemed to have aroused the pandemic. In Washington State, USA, the CoViD-19 epidemic during the first two months of the year, starting at the end of February 2020, was mainly caused by the type-C virus. During this period, the infection spread rapidly; from May onwards, the number of viruses with wild-type helicases became higher than that of type-C viruses, and no type-C viruses have been collected since early July. The involvement of the helicase in this COVID-19 disease was discussed.","Miyake, Jun; Yoshino, Mitsuaki; Sato, Takaaki; Niioka, Hirohiko; Sakata, Yasushi; Nakazawa, Yoshihisa",,602,25

STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Statement. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies comprising 83 neonates born to mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 were included in the present systematic review. Among these neonates, three were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 16, 36, and 72 hours after birth, respectively, by nasopharyngeal swab real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests; another six had elevated virus-specific antibody levels in serum samples collected after birth, but negative RT-PCR test results. However, without positive RT-PCR tests of amniotic fluid, placenta, or cord blood, there is a lack of virologic evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: There is currently no direct evidence to support intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additional RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are needed to ascertain the possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission. For pregnant women infected during their first and second trimesters, further studies focusing on long-term outcomes are needed. KEY POINTS: · We review neonates of mothers diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 detected by RT-PCR.. · No direct virologic evidence of vertical transmission has been reported.. · No evidence that cesarean delivery is safer than vaginal delivery.. · More RT-PCR tests on amniotic fluid, placenta, and cord blood are recommended..","Yang, Ziyi; Liu, Yi",Am J Perinatol,602,10

INTERVENTION: A team of nurses at the University of Ottawa and Ottawa Public Health and staff from the Ontario HIV Treatment Network (OHTN) obtained Health Canada's Special Access approval on April 23, 2020 to distribute bioLytical's INSTI HIV self-test in Ottawa; we received REB approval on May 15, 2020. As of July 20, 2020, eligible participants (&#8805;18 years old, HIV-negative, not on PrEP, not in an HIV vaccine trial, living in Ottawa, no bleeding disorders) could register via www.GetaKit.ca to order kits. OUTCOMES: In the first 6 weeks, 637 persons completed our eligibility screener; 43.3% (n = 276) were eligible. Of eligible participants, 203 completed a baseline survey and 182 ordered a test. These 203 participants were an average of 31 years old, 72.3% were white, 60.4% were cis-male, and 55% self-identified as gay. Seventy-one percent (n = 144) belonged to a priority group for HIV testing. We have results for 70.9% (n = 129/182) of participants who ordered a kit: none were positive, 104 were negative, 22 were invalid, and 2 ""preferred not to say""; 1 participant reported an unreadiness to test. IMPLICATIONS: Our results show that HIV self-testing is a pandemic-friendly strategy to help ensure access to sexual health services among persons who are good candidates for HIV testing. It is unsurprising that no one tested positive for HIV thus far, given the 0.08% positivity rate for HIV testing in Ottawa. As such, we advocate for scale-up of HIV self-testing in Canada.","O039,; Byrne, Patrick; Musten, Alexandra; Orser, Lauren; Inamdar, Gauri; Grayson, Marie-Odile; Jones, Clay; Francoeur, Megan; Lachance, Sarah; Paulin, Vickie",Can. j. public health,602,33

The online landscape and patterns of information consumption, however, have notably changed over the past decade necessitating an updated examination of health-related internet use (HRIU) among cancer survivors. METHODS: Using survey data from 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) iterations, the objectives of this study were to report prevalence, trends, and user profiles in HRIU in terms of emailing doctors, buying medicine online, and support group participation. Descriptive analyses and weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Cancer survivors who reported not using the internet were more likely to be older, belong to ethnic minorities, be less educated, and reside in rural areas as compared with those who reported using the internet. Except for participation in online support groups, all other types of HRIU increased in prevalence across the years. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the increased penetration of the internet and the altered online health communication landscape, we found increased prevalence of HRIU among cancer survivors. However, the digital divide persists in terms of internet access. These findings can inform initiatives to bridge the gap among survivors of varying profiles in using the internet for their health needs. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: There is increased reliance on online platforms to obtain and communicate health-related information. The risk with this approach is potential oversight of ensuring equity in terms of internet access and technology literacy among survivors.","Fareed, Naleef; Swoboda, Christine M; Jonnalagadda, Pallavi; Huerta, Timothy R",,602,32

Over the recent years, two major shifts have taken place within the WHO to orient toward response to emergencies, namely the introduction of the Humanitarian Reform and the Cluster Approach in 2005 and the introduction of the Emergency Response Framework (ERF). The financing of the agency in humanitarian operations is adding emerging elements to the WHO operations, especially because of the constantly higher contribution from non-state- and state- funding agencies.

However, data acquisition and medical quality management during hospital stay still need to be improved in China. We have developed a computer-based medical data collecting system, together with automated calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and regular individualized education, and thus aim to explore whether it can improve the medical care quality of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) during hospital stay in stroke centers. METHODS: The individualized quality improvement based on the Computer Analysing system to improve Stroke management quality Evaluation (CASE) trial is a prospective, multicenter, historical control study among 30 stroke centers in China. In this trial, the data is directly extracted from the saved original medical record of each AIS patient during hospital stay, regardless of different Electronic Medical Record System (EMRS) in each center. Then, the automated calculation of KPIs and the regular education via teleconference per month allow the clinicians to examine the causes of non-compliance of guideline-based care and develop programs to decrease their frequency. DISCUSSION: We compare KPIs between pre-intervention stage and post-intervention stage (without or with education) among stroke centers. If proved effective, this approach might be generalized around China and even worldwide, where a unified EMRS is difficult to be applied and in-patient care needs to be improved.

We set out to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of these patients in the United States. METHODS: Participants in a US-wide longitudinal observational registry responded to a supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire by e-mail on March 25, 2020, about their symptoms, COVID-19 testing, health care changes, and related experiences during the prior 2 weeks. Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms. Qualitative analysis was conducted on optional free-text comment fields. RESULTS: Of the 7061 participants invited to participate, 530 responded, with RA as the most frequent diagnosis (61%). Eleven participants met COVID-19 screening criteria, of whom two sought testing unsuccessfully. Six others sought testing, three of whom were successful, and all test results were negative. Not quite half of participants (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior 2 weeks. Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications, including hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: After 2 weeks, many participants with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their health care, with many altering medications without professional consultation or because of hydroxychloroquine shortage. As evidence accumulates on the effectiveness of potential COVID-19 treatments, effort is needed to safeguard access to established treatments for rheumatic diseases.","Michaud, Kaleb; Wipfler, Kristin; Shaw, Yomei; Simon, Teresa A; Cornish, Adam; England, Bryant R; Ogdie, Alexis; Katz, Patricia",,602,23

These deep models act as an aid to hospitals that suffer from the unavailability of specialists or radiologists, specifically in remote areas. Various deep models have been proposed to detect the COVID-19 cases, but few works have been performed to prevent the deep models against adversarial attacks capable of fooling the deep model by using a small perturbation in image pixels. This paper presents an evaluation of the performance of deep COVID-19 models against adversarial attacks. Also, it proposes an efficient yet effective Fuzzy Unique Image Transformation (FUIT) technique that downsamples the image pixels into an interval. The images obtained after the FUIT transformation are further utilized for training the secure deep model that preserves high accuracy of the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases and provides reliable defense against the adversarial attacks. The experiments and results show the proposed model prevents the deep model against the six adversarial attacks and maintains high accuracy to classify the COVID-19 cases from the Chest X-Ray image and CT image Datasets. The results also recommend that a careful inspection is required before practically applying the deep models to diagnose the COVID-19 cases.","Tripathi, Achyut Mani; Mishra, Ashish",,602,22

Pour se faire, les modèles probit et logit multinomiale ont été utilisés en se basant sur des données collectées auprès de 1405 ménages dans 44 districts des 6 régions sanitaires. Les résultats révèlent que les ménages dans lesquels le chef a perdu son emploi sont plus exposés à une baisse de revenu et donc à une réduction de leur consommation alimentaire pendant la pandémie. Toutefois, les transferts monétaires octroyés aux personnes vulnérables ont un effet positif, mais non significatif sur le changement de leur revenu. Par ailleurs, les ménages bénéficiaires de prestations sociales au sein desquels le chef a un niveau d'éducation supérieur, sont plus susceptibles de supporter les effets de la pandémie. Ainsi, pour les ménages ayant ressenti un effet modéré ou sévère de la crise, la probabilité est élevée qu'ils diminuent leur consommation alimentaire.

Although ERAS is associated with significant clinical outcome improvements and cost savings in numerous surgical specialties, several opportunities and challenges deserve further discussion. Observations: Uptake and implementation of ERAS Society guidelines, together with ERAS-related research, have increased exponentially since the inception of the ERAS movement. Opportunities to further improve patient outcomes include addressing frailty, optimizing nutrition, prehabilitation, correcting preoperative anemia, and improving uptake of ERAS worldwide, including in low- and middle-income countries. Challenges facing enhanced recovery today include implementation, carbohydrate loading, reversal of neuromuscular blockade, and bowel preparation.

However, previous case reports suggest that low-voltage shock impedance measurements may fail to detect insulation breaches that can cause life-threatening electrical short circuits. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report six cases of insulation breaches in transvenous defibrillation leads that were not obvious during standard interrogations and testing of the lead beforehand. In two cases, an electrical short circuit during commanded shock delivery for internal electrical cardioversion resulted in a total damage of the ICD generator. In one of these cases, commanded shock delivery induced ventricular fibrillation, which required external defibrillation. In two cases, a shock due to ventricular tachycardia was aborted as the shock impedance was less than 20 &#937;. However, in both cases the tiny residual shock energy terminated the ventricular tachycardia. In contrast, in one case the residual energy of the aborted shock did not end ventricular fibrillation induced at defibrillator threshold testing. In one case, the ICD indicated an error code for a short circuit condition detected during an adequate shock delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This case series illustrates that low-voltage shock impedance measurements can fail to detect insulation breaches. These data suggest that in patients without a contraindication, traditional defibrillator threshold testing or high voltage synchronized shock at the time of device replacement should be considered.","Parwani, Abdul Shokor; Lacour, Philipp; Franke, Philip; Reichert, Uwe; Christoph, Klein; Beiert, Thomas; Supryn, Rafal; Rangasamy, Karthikeyan; Kull, Tony; Hohendanner, Felix; Heinzel, Frank; Kucher, Andreas; Boldt, Leif-Hendrik; Pieske, Burkert; Blaschke, Florian",Pacing clin. electrophysiol,602,16

Covid-19 became a global pandemic, which led to a harmful impact on the world. Many predictive models of Covid-19 are being proposed by academic researchers around the world to take the foremost decisions and enforce the appropriate control measures. Due to the lack of accurate Covid-19 records and uncertainty, the standard techniques are being failed to correctly predict the epidemic global effects. To address this issue, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based meta-analysis to predict the trend of epidemic Covid-19 over the world. The powerful machine learning algorithms namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression were applied on real time-series dataset, which holds the global record of confirmed, recovered, deaths and active cases of Covid-19 outbreak. Statistical analysis has also been conducted to present various facts regarding Covid-19 observed symptoms, a list of Top-20 Coronavirus affected countries and a number of coactive cases over the world. Among the three machine learning techniques investigated, Naïve Bayes produced promising results to predict Covid-19 future trends with less Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The less value of MAE and MSE strongly represent the effectiveness of the Naïve Bayes regression technique. Although, the global footprint of this pandemic is still uncertain. This study demonstrates the various trends and future growth of the global pandemic for a proactive response from the citizens and governments of countries. This paper sets the initial benchmark to demonstrate the capability of machine learning for outbreak prediction.","Tiwari, Dimple; Bhati, Bhoopesh Singh; Al-Turjman, Fadi; Nagpal, Bharti",Expert syst,602,24

This localized activity results in reduced toxicity compared to type I IFNs, whose receptors are ubiquitously expressed. IFN-&#955; has been effective in the therapy of respiratory viral infections, playing a crucial role in potentiating adaptive immune responses that initiate at mucosal surfaces. Human IFN-&#955; has polymorphisms that may cause differences in the interaction with the specific receptor in the human population. Interestingly, bovine IFN-&#955;3 has an in silico-predicted higher affinity for the human receptor than its human counterparts, with high identity with different human IFN-&#955; variants, making it a suitable antiviral therapeutic candidate for human health. Here, we demonstrate that a recombinant bovine IFN-&#955; (rbIFN-&#955;) produced in HEK-293 cells is effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells, with an inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) between 30 and 50 times lower than that of human type I IFN tested here (&#945;2b and ß1a). We also demonstrated the absence of toxicity of rbIFN-&#955; in human PBMCs and the lack of proinflammatory activity on these cells. Altogether, our results show that rbIFN-&#955; is as an effective antiviral potentially suitable for COVID-19 therapy. Among other potential applications, rbIFN-&#955; could be useful to preclude virus dispersion to the lungs and/or to reduce transmission from infected people. Moreover, and due to the non-specific activity of this IFN, it can be potentially effective against other respiratory viruses that may be circulating together with SARS-CoV-2.","Cardoso, Nancy Patricia; Mansilla, Florencia Celeste; Benedetti, Estefanía; Turco, Cecilia Soledad; Barone, Lucas José; Iserte, Javier Alonso; Soria, Ivana; Baumeister, Elsa; Capozzo, Alejandra Victoria",Front Vet Sci,602,24

This is being observed firsthand during the current COVID-19 crisis, as novel mutations challenge our global vaccination race. To address this, we introduce here a general framework to model epidemic spreading under pathogen evolution, finding that mutations can fundamentally alter the projection of the spread. Specifically, we detect a new pandemic phase - the mutated phase - in which, despite the fact that the pathogen is initially non-pandemic (R0<1), it may still spread due to the emergence of a critical mutation. The boundaries of this phase portray a balance between the epidemic and the evolutionary time-scales. If the mutation rate is too low, the pathogen prevalence decays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the other hand, if mutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and, once again, it fails to spread. Between these two extremes, however, we observe a broad range of conditions in which an initially sub-pandemic pathogen will eventually gain prevalence. This is especially relevant during vaccination, which creates, as it progresses, increasing selection pressure towards vaccine-resistance. To overcome this, we show that vaccination campaigns must be accompanied by fierce mitigation efforts, to suppress the potential rise of a resistant mutant strain.","Zhang, Xiyun; Ruan, Zhongyuan; Zheng, Muhua; Zhou, Jie; Boccaletti, Stefano; Barzel, Baruch",,602,16

This, combined with the government-imposed lockdown, may have impacted on patient attendance, severity of surgical disease, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible 'lockdown' effect on the volume and severity of surgical admissions and their outcomes. METHODS: Two separate cohorts of adult emergency general surgery inpatient admissions 30 days immediately before (February 16, 2020 to March 15, 2020), and after UK government advice (March 16, 2020 to April 15, 2020). Data were collected relating to patient characteristics, severity of disease, clinical outcomes, and compared between these groups. RESULTS: Following lockdown, a significant reduction in median daily admissions from 7 to 3 per day (pâ¯<â¯0.001) was observed. Post-lockdown patients were significantly older, frailer with higher inflammatory indices and rates of acute kidney injury, and also were significantly more likely to present with gastrointestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. Patients had significantly higher rates of Clavien-Dindo Grade &#8805;3 complications (pâ¯=â¯0.001), all cause 30-day mortality (8.5% vs. 2.9%, pâ¯=â¯0.028), but no significant difference was observed in operative 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: There appears to be a ""lockdown"" effect on general surgical admissions with a profound impact; fewer surgical admissions, more acutely unwell surgical patients, and an increase in all cause 30-day mortality. Patients should be advised to present promptly with gastrointestinal symptoms, and this should be reinforced for future lockdowns during the pandemic.","McLean, Ross C; Young, John; Musbahi, Aya; Lee, Jing Xian; Hidayat, Hena; Abdalla, Nagi; Chowdhury, Sabyasachi; Baker, Elizabeth A; Etherson, Kevin Jon",Int J Surg,602,16

METHODS: We will conduct a systematic review based on searches of major databases (eg, Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, SCI-EXPANDED, CPCI-S, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang Database) and clinical trial registries from inception to present without limitations of language and publication status. All published randomized control trials, quasi-randomized trials, retrospective and observational studies related to prophylactic antiplatelet/anticoagulant for severe COVID-19 will be included. Primary outcome includes incident acute thrombosis events. Second outcome is the incidence and severity of adverse effects. Full-text screening, data extraction and quality assessment will be conducted by 2 reviewers independently. The reporting quality, risk of bias, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis will be performed to ensure the reliability of our findings by other 2 researchers. The statistical analysis will be performed by RevMan V.5.3 software and Stata V.12.0 software. RESULTS: The result of this systematic review will provide valid advice and consultation for clinicians on the management of prophylactic antiplatelet/anticoagulant for severe COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the liver function in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and potential causes of hepatic enzymes disease in these patients. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were collected from patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the corona center in Erbil city/Kurdistan region of Iraq, from March 10 to July 10, 2020. Serum was collected from patients with COVID-19 and liver enzyme tests were measured. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL) were analyzed in these patients. Of the 74 patients, 25 (34.7%) had abnormal ALT activity, 28 (40%) had abnormal AST activity, 12 (20.3%) had abnormal ALP activity, and 39 (52.7%) had abnormal total bilirubin P-value < 0.05.

It is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers (source control), or both. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541). SETTING: Denmark, April and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without occupational mask use. INTERVENTION: Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 surgical masks and instructions for proper use. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was -0.3 percentage point (95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection. LIMITATION: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others. CONCLUSION: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.

Pointing out the topic of obesity has an immediate impact on patients’ mental health, adding up to increased difficulties they already experience, mental distress being directly associated to the perception of the discrimination they face The massive and obsessing reiteration (so much that it ends up inducing culpability) of the vulnerability of obese patients is likely to generate or increase mental disorders that will, in turn, aggravate binge eating and reinforce the medical distancing already observed in this population Behaviors initiated by the unprecedented situation of the lock down and the alarmist discussions about food and health are so contradictory that their impact of cognitive restraint may induce or worsen eating disorders in patients","Tubiana, Alexandra Morvan Ronan Garcia Savéria Lecerf Jean-Michel",Médecine des Maladies Métaboliques,602,24

These sensors would continually monitor the manhole's wastewater, and whenever virus remnants are detected, transmit an alert signal. In a recent paper, we described two new algorithms, each sequentially opening and testing successive manholes for genetic remnants, each algorithm homing in on a neighborhood where the infected person or persons are located. This paper extends that work in six important ways: (1) we introduce the concept of in-manhole sensors, as these sensors will reduce the number of manholes requiring on-site testing; (2) we present a realistic tree network depicting the topology of the sewer pipeline network; (3) for simulations, we present a method to create random tree networks exhibiting key attributes of a given community; (4) using the simulations, we empirically demonstrate that the mean and median number of manholes to be opened in a search follows a well-known logarithmic function; (5) we develop procedures for determining the number of sensors to deploy; (6) we formulate the sensor location problem as an integer nonlinear optimization and develop heuristics to solve it. Our sensor-manhole system, to be implemented, would require at least three additional steps in R&D: (a) an accurate, inexpensive and fast SARS-Cov-2 genetic-remnants test that can be done at the manhole; (b) design, test and manufacture of the sensors; (c) in-the-field testing and fine tuning of an implemented system.","Nourinejad, Mehdi; Berman, Oded; Larson, Richard C",PLoS One,602,20

We address some of these misconceptions, namely, how R changes over time, varies over space, and relates to epidemic size by referencing the mathematical definition of R and examples from the current pandemic.

However, little is known about their interactions with neutrophils and how this might contribute to injury. Here, it is shown that histone H4 acts as neutrophil activator by inducing hydrogen peroxide production, degranulation, cell adhesion, and IL-8 generation. Histone H4 caused permeabilization of the neutrophil membrane (a phenomenon described in other cell types) leading to accelerated cell death. H4 caused sustained rise in neutrophil intracellular calcium that is necessary for respiratory burst activation and degranulation. Convincing evidence was not found for TLRs or ATP receptors in H4 mediated activation. However, pertussis toxin and wortmannin (inhibitors of G protein and PI3K) inhibited H4-induced hydrogen peroxide production and degranulation. These studies suggest that release of histone H4 in sites of infection or inflammation may potentiate neutrophil activation and promote additional inflammatory responses. These studies may provide a better basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies to block neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) and H4-related pathology in sepsis and various forms of lung injury including that induced by viruses like influenza or SAR-CoV2.","Hsieh, I-Ni; Deluna, Xavier; White, Mitchell R; Hartshorn, Kevan L",J. leukoc. biol,602,16

Little is known about the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. The goal herein, was to evaluate the prognostic impact of having heart disease (HD) and taking cardiovascular medications in a population diagnosed of COVID-19 who required hospitalization. Also, we studied the development of cardiovascular events during hospitalization. METHODS: Consecutive patients with definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 made by a positive real time- -polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs who were admitted to the hospital from March 15 to April 14 were included in a retrospective registry. The association of HD with mortality and with mortality or respiratory failure were the primary and secondary objectives, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 859 patients were included in the present analysis. Cardiovascular risk factors were related to death, particularly diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio in the multivariate analysis: 1.810 [1.159- -2.827], p = 0.009). A total of 113 (13.1%) patients had HD. The presence of HD identified a group of patients with higher mortality (35.4% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001) but HD was not independently related to prognosis; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers did not worsen prognosis. Statins were independently associated with decreased mortality (0.551 [0.329-0.921], p = 0.023). Cardiovascular events during hospitalization identified a group of patients with poor outcome (mortality 31.8% vs. 19.3% without cardiovascular events, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of HD is related to higher mortality. Cardiovascular medications taken before admission are not harmful, statins being protective. The development of cardiovascular events during the course of the disease is related to poor outcome.","Cabezón Villalba, Gonzalo; Amat-Santos, Ignacio J; Dueñas, Carlos; Lopez Otero, Diego; Catala, Pablo; Aparisi, Alvaro; López-Pais, Javier; Cacho Antonio, Carla Eugenia; Candela, Jordi; Antúnez Muiños, Pablo; Gil, Jose Francisco; Gonzalez Ferrero, Teba; Marcos, Marta; Pérez-Poza, Marta; Rojas, Gino; Otero Garcia, Oscar; Veras, Carlos; Jiménez Ramos, Victor; Uribarri, Aitor; Revilla, Ana; Garcia-Granja, Pablo Elpidio; Gómez, Itziar; González-Juanatey, José Ramón; San Román, J Alberto",Cardiol J,602,24

Robust, coordinated IgA and IgG antibody responses were preceded by bursts of spike-specific plasmablasts after both doses, but earlier and more intensely after dose two. Distinct antigen-specific MBC populations also emerged post-vaccination with varying kinetics. We identified antigen non-specific pre-vaccination MBC and post-vaccination plasmablasts after dose one and their spike-specific counterparts early after dose two that correlated with subsequent antibody levels.

ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the oral cavity, so this may be a potential high-risk route for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the virus can be detected in saliva, even before COVID-19 symptoms appear, with the consequent high risk of virus transmission in asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. Reducing oral viral load could lead to a lower risk of transmission via salivary droplets or aerosols and therefore contribute to the control of the pandemic. Our aim was to evaluate the available evidence testing the in-vitro and in-vivo effects of oral antiseptics to inactivate or eradicate coronaviruses. The criteria used were those described in the PRISMA declaration for performing systematic reviews. An electronic search was conducted in Medline (via PubMed) and in Web of Sciences, using the MeSH terms: 'mouthwash' OR 'oral rinse' OR 'mouth rinse' OR 'povidone iodine' OR 'hydrogen peroxide' OR 'cetylpyridinium chloride' AND 'COVID-19' OR 'SARS-CoV-2' OR 'coronavirus' OR 'SARS' OR 'MERS'. The initial search strategy identified 619 articles on two electronic databases. Seventeen articles were included assessing the virucidal efficacy of oral antiseptics against coronaviruses. In conclusion, there is sufficient in-vitro evidence to support the use of antiseptics to potentially reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. However, in-vivo evidence for most oral antiseptics is limited.

This questionnaire consisted of 9 question items using a Likert scale. Results: 285 respondents came from WhatsApp media users (89.9%) with an average age of 29.91 years. Respondents who experienced ""dental health problems"" during the pandemic were 44.7%. The knowledge of respondents about the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in dental care was 79.9% and the knowledge of the fear of caring during the pandemic period was 31.85% afraid. Statistical analysis showed a significant relationship between knowledge about transmission of the COVID-19 virus and fear of dental care (rs=0.388, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The results obtained have a significant relationship between knowledge about transmission and fear for dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Sulawesi Province.","Pasiga, Burhanuddin Daeng",Pesqui. bras. odontopediatria clín. integr,602,26

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort in Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March, 2020. METHODS: We did a population-based study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Iquitos at two timepoints: July 13-18, 2020 (baseline), and Aug 13-18, 2020 (1-month follow-up). We obtained a geographically stratified representative sample of the city population using the 2017 census data, which was updated on Jan 20, 2020. We included people who were inhabitants of Iquitos since COVID-19 was identified in Peru (March 6, 2020) or earlier. We excluded people living in institutions, people receiving any pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, people with any contraindication for phlebotomy, and health workers or individuals living with an active health worker. We tested each participant for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, China). We used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. FINDINGS: We identified 726 eligible individuals and enrolled a total of 716 participants (99%), distributed across 40 strata (four districts, two sexes, and five age groups). We excluded ten individuals who: did not have consent from a parent or legal representative (n=3), had moved to Iquitos after March 6, 2020 (n=3), were in transit (n=2), or had respiratory symptoms (n=1). After adjusting for the study sampling effects and sensitivity and specificity of the test, we estimated a seroprevalence of 70% (95% CI 67-73) at baseline and 66% (95% CI 62-70) at 1 month of follow-up, with a test-retest positivity of 65% (95% CI 61-68), and an incidence of new exposures of 2% (95% CI 1-3). We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants aged 18-29 years having lower seroprevalence than those aged younger than 12 years (prevalence ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·73-0·98]; p=0·029). INTERPRETATION: After the first epidemic peak, Iquitos had one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies worldwide. Nevertheless, the city experienced a second wave starting in January, 2021, probably due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 P1 variant, which has shown higher transmissibility and reinfection rates.

Although COVID-19 vaccines are showing promising results, they are not 100% effective and resistant mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains are on the rise. To successfully fight against SARS-CoV-2 and prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks, it is essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 protein functions, their host interactions, and how these processes convey pathogenicity at host tissue, organ and systemic levels. In vitro models are valuable but lack the physiological context of a whole organism. Current animal models for SARS-CoV-2 research are exclusively mammals, with the intrinsic limitations of long reproduction times, few progeny, ethical concerns and high maintenance costs. These limitations make them unsuitable for rapid functional investigations of virus proteins as well as genetic and pharmacological screens. Remarkably, 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interacting proteins are conserved between Drosophila and humans. As a well-established model system for studying human diseases, the fruit fly offers a highly complementary alternative to current mammalian models for SARS-CoV-2 research, from investigating virus protein function to developing targeted drugs. Herein, we review Drosophila ’s track record in studying human viruses and discuss the advantages and limitations of using fruit flies for SARS-CoV-2 research. We also review studies that already used Drosophila to investigate SARS-CoV-2 protein pathogenicity and their damaging effects in COVID-19 relevant tissues, as well as studies in which the fly was used as an efficient whole animal drug testing platform for targeted therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 proteins or their host interacting pathways.","van de Leemput, Joyce Han Zhe",Cell &amp; Bioscience,602,24

DESIGN: Multimethod study. SETTING: Cancer center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1968 virtual patient visits were completed during the study period. Adult survivors of cancer (n=12) and oncology health care providers (n=12) participated in semi-structured interviews. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Framework-driven categorization of program modifications, qualitative interviews with patients and providers, and a comparison of process outcomes with the previous 90 days of in-person care via referrals, completed visits and attendance, method of delivery, weekly capacities, and wait times. RESULTS: The majority of program visits could be adapted to virtual delivery, with format, setting, and content modifications. Virtual care demonstrated an increase or maintenance in the number of completed visits by appointment type compared with in-person care, with attendance ranging from 80%-93%. For most appointment types, capacities increased, whereas wait times decreased slightly. Overall, 168 patients (11% of all assessments and follow-ups) assessed virtually were identified by providers as requiring an in-person appointment because of reassessment of musculoskeletal and/or neurologic impairment (n=109, 65%) and lymphedema (n=59, 35%). The interviews (n=24) revealed that virtual care was an acceptable alternative in some circumstances, with the ability to (1) increase access to care; (2) provide a sense of reassurance during a time of isolation; and (3) provide confidence in learning skills to self-manage impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Many appointments can be successfully adapted to virtual formats to deliver cancer rehabilitation programming. Based on our findings, we provide practical recommendations that can be implemented by providers and programs to facilitate the adoption and delivery of virtual care.","Lopez, Christian J; Edwards, Beth; Langelier, David M; Chang, Eugene K; Chafranskaia, Aleksandra; Jones, Jennifer M",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,602,16

With quarantine and social distancing restrictions, school closures, and recreational venues suspended or providing reduced access, the social safety net for violence prevention has been disrupted significantly. Impacts include the concerns of underreporting and increased risk of child abuse and neglect, as well as challenges in operating CPSs and keeping their workforce safe. OBJECTIVE: The current discussion paper explored the impact of COVID-19 on child maltreatment reports and CPS responses by comparing countries using available population data. METHOD: Information was gathered from researchers in eight countries, including contextual information about the country's demographics and economic situation, key elements of the CPS, and the CPS response to COVID-19. Where available, information about other factors affecting children was also collected. These data informed a discussion about between-country similarities and differences. RESULTS: COVID-19 had significant impact on the operation of every CPS, whether in high- income or low-income countries. Most systems encountered some degree of service disruption or change. Risk factors for children appeared to increase while there were often substantial deficits in CPS responses, and in most countries there was at a temporary decrease in CM reports despite the increased risks to children. CONCLUSIONS: The initial data presented and discussed among the international teams pointed to the way COVID-19 has hampered CPS responses and the protection of children more generally in most jurisdictions, highlighting that children appear to have been at greater risk for maltreatment during COVID-19.","Katz, Ilan; Katz, Carmit; Andresen, Sabine; Bérubé, Annie; Collin-Vezina, Delphine; Fallon, Barbara; Fouché, Ansie; Haffejee, Sadiyya; Masrawa, Nadia; Muñoz, Pablo; Priolo Filho, Sidnei R; Tarabulsy, George; Truter, Elmien; Varela, Natalia; Wekerle, Christine",Child Abuse Negl,602,1

We assessed kidney complications among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong, including the association with risk factors, length of hospitalization, critical presentation, and mortality. METHODS: Linked electronic records of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 5 major designated hospitals were extracted. Duplicated records due to interhospital transferal were removed. Primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI). Secondary outcomes were AKI-associated mortality, incident renal replacement therapy (RRT), intensive care admission, prolonged hospitalization and disease course (defined as >90th percentile of hospitalization duration [35 days] and duration from symptom onset to discharge [43 days], respectively), and change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Patients were further stratified into being symptomatic or asymptomatic. RESULTS: Patients were characterized by young age (median: 38.4, IQR: 28.4-55.8 years) and short time (median: 5, IQR: 2-9 days) from symptom onset to admission. Among the 591 patients, 22 (3.72%) developed AKI and 4 (0.68%) required RRT. The median time from symptom onset to in-hospital AKI was 15 days. AKI increased the odds of prolonged hospitalization and disease course by 2.0- and 3.5-folds, respectively. Estimated GFR 24 weeks post-discharge reduced by 7.51 and 1.06 mL/min/1.73 m2 versus baseline (upon admission) in the AKI and non-AKI groups, respectively. The incidence of AKI was comparable between asymptomatic (4.8%, n = 3/62) and symptomatic (3.7%, n = 19/519) patients. CONCLUSION: The overall rate of AKI among COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong is low, which could be attributable to a vigilant screening program and early hospitalization. Among patients who developed in-hospital AKI, the duration of hospitalization is prolonged and kidney function impairment can persist for up to 6 months post-discharge.

Physiological high-altitude characteristics and symptoms of altitude illnesses furthermore seem similar to several pathologies associated with COVID-19. As a consequence, high altitude and hypoxia research and related clinical practices are discussed for potential applications in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. We summarize the currently available evidence on the relationship between altitude/hypoxia conditions and COVID-19 epidemiology and pathophysiology. The potential for treatment strategies used for altitude illnesses is evaluated. Symptomatic overlaps in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced ARDS and high altitude illnesses (i.e., hypoxemia, dyspnea ) have been reported but are also common to other pathologies (i.e., heart failure, pulmonary embolism, COPD ). Most treatments of altitude illnesses have limited value and may even be detrimental in COVID-19. Some may be efficient, potentially the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Physiological adaptations to altitude/hypoxia can exert diverse effects, depending on the constitution of the target individual and the hypoxic dose. In healthy individuals, they may optimize oxygen supply and increase mitochondrial, antioxidant, and immune system function. It is highly debated if these physiological responses to hypoxia overlap in many instances with SARS-CoV-2 infection and may exert preventive effects under very specific conditions. The temporal overlap of SARS-CoV-2 infection and exposure to altitude/hypoxia may be detrimental. No evidence-based knowledge is presently available on whether and how altitude/hypoxia may prevent, treat or aggravate COVID-19. The reported lower incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in high-altitude places remain to be confirmed. High-altitude illnesses and COVID-19 pathologies exhibit clear pathophysiological differences. While potentially effective as a prophylactic measure, altitude/hypoxia is likely associated with elevated risks for patients with COVID-19. Altogether, the different points discussed in this review are of possibly some relevance for individuals who aim to reach high-altitude areas. However, due to the ever-changing state of understanding of COVID-19, all points discussed in this review may be out of date at the time of its publication.","Millet, Grégoire P; Debevec, Tadej; Brocherie, Franck; Burtscher, Martin; Burtscher, Johannes",Physiol Rep,602,16

Hyperplastic axillary nodes can be seen on sonography after any vaccination but are more common after a vaccine that evokes a strong immune response, such as the COVID-19 vaccine. As the differential of unilateral axillary adenopathy includes breast malignancy, it is crucial to both thoroughly evaluate the breast for primary malignancy and to elicit history of recent vaccination. As COVID-19 vaccines will soon be available to a larger patient population, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging features of COVID-19 vaccine induced hyperplastic adenopathy and its inclusion in a differential for unilateral axillary adenopathy. Short-term follow-up for unilateral axillary adenopathy in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination is an appropriate recommendation, in lieu of immediately performing potentially unnecessary and costly axillary lymph node biopsies.","Mehta, Nishi; Sales, Rachel Marcus; Babagbemi, Kemi; Levy, Allison D; McGrath, Anika L; Drotman, Michele; Dodelzon, Katerina",Clin Imaging,602,21

The dynamics consists of a Susceptible-Infected (SI) model based on the Caputo fractional-order derivative. We find an upper bound to the analytical solution of this model which represents the worse-case scenario on the propagation of perturbations across a protein residue network. This upper bound is expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions of the adjacency matrix of the network of inter-amino acids interactions. We then apply this model to the analysis of the propagation of perturbations produced by inhibitors of the main protease of SARS CoV-2. We find that the perturbations produced by strong inhibitors of the protease are propagated far away from the binding site, confirming the long-range nature of intra-protein communication. On the contrary, the weakest inhibitors only transmit their perturbations across a close environment around the binding site. These findings may help to the design of drug candidates against this new coronavirus.","Abadias, Luciano; Estrada-Rodriguez, Gissell; Estrada, Ernesto",Fractional Calc. Appl. Anal.,602,24

In this study, we investigated the toxicity of wastewaters originating from beef cattle feeding operation on Daphnia pulex. Specifically, we assessed lethal and chronic sublethal exposure effects using various endpoints including survival, oxygen consumption, morphology, reproduction, and swimming behavior. Exposure assessments (acute and chronic) were performed with ten (10) surface water samples collected from on-site retention ponds designated as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and R (reference site). Surface water samples were diluted to yield five concentrations (stock, 1 × , 2 × , 3 × , and 4 ×) as treatments and deionized water was used as control. Results showed site-specific and concentration-related effects on toxicity endpoints. Among treatments, significant (p < 0.05) increase in mortality rate (for A, E, F, and H) and decreasing total body length and width (for B, C, D, and G) of D. pulex were observed with increasing wastewater concentration. However, treatments did not have significant effect on swimming behavior (average speed) after exposure to the wastewater samples from all sites except for site E. Evidence from this study suggested that surface waters near beef cattle feed yards affected physiological responses in D. pulex and therefore may similarly affect organisms in the surrounding aquatic ecosystems.","Ayodeji, Olukayode J; Awoyemi, Olushola M",Environ Monit Assess,602,1

This increase may be a result of different events: a temporal decline of the vaccines efficacy; Lower efficacy of the vaccine against the current Delta ((B.1.617.2) variant (which is now the dominant strain in Israel); A result of lack of social restrictions, a highly contagious variant, or any combination of the above. We found, by using a novel spatial-dynamic model and recent aggregate data from Israel, that this new surge of cases is partiality due to a decline in the shielding of those who were vaccinated about six months ago. Also, we found a decrease in the vaccines efficacy against severe morbidity for the early elderly population compared to the rest of the vaccinated population. These results, which are consistent with recent studies, emphasize the high ability of the model in evaluating the time- and age- dependent efficacy of the vaccine for different age groups and enables to predict the spread of the pandemic as a function of such efficacy.","De-Leon, Hilla; Pederiva, Francesco",,602,1

Recent experiences with COVID-19 show that by using a smart and swift approach to deal with pandemics, avoids overwhelming of healthcare systems, and reduces the loss of precious life. This paper is about using smart technologies such as Mobile Edge Clouds (MEC), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as an approach to effectively manage pandemics. IoT provides pervasive connectivity among various devices and can be used for collecting information such as location and symptoms of potentially infected individuals. MECs provide cloud services on the edge, integrating IoT infrastructure and execution of sophisticated AI algorithms in the Cloud. In this paper, we develop a prototype to demonstrate the convergence of pervasive technologies to support research in managing pandemics. Low-cost Single Board Computers (SBC) based clusters are integrated within MEC to support remote medical teams in the field. The prototype implements a lightweight Docker container orchestrated by Kubernetes eco-system which is deployed on the clusters. The prototype successfully demonstrates that mobile medical facilities can utilize the proposed solution to collect information and execute AI algorithms while on the go.

The purpose of this communication was to report the impact of the pandemic on surgical training and learner well-being and to document adaptations made by surgery departments. STUDY DESIGN: A 37-item survey was distributed to educational leaders in general surgery and other surgical specialty training programs. It included both closed- and open-ended questions and the self-reported stages of GME during the COVID-19 pandemic, as defined by the ACGME. Statistical associations for items with stage were assessed using categorical analysis. RESULTS: The response rate was 21% (472 of 2,196). US stage distribution (n = 447) was as follows: stage 1, 22%; stage 2, 48%; and stage 3, 30%. Impact on clinical education significantly increased by stage, with severe reductions in nonemergency operations (73% and 86% vs 98%) and emergency operations (8% and 16% vs 34%). Variable effects were reported on minimal expected case numbers across all stages. Reductions were reported in outpatient experience (83%), in-hospital experience (70%), and outside rotations (57%). Increases in ICU rotations were reported with advancing stage (7% and 13% vs 37%). Severity of impact on didactic education increased with stage (14% and 30% vs 46%). Virtual conferences were adopted by 97% across all stages. Severity of impact on learner well-being increased by stage-physical safety (6% and 9% vs 31%), physical health (0% and 7% vs 17%), and emotional health (11% and 24% vs 42%). Regardless of stage, most but not all made adaptations to support trainees' well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic adversely impacted surgical training and the well-being of learners across all surgical specialties proportional to increasing ACGME stage. There is a need to develop education disaster plans to support technical competency and learner well-being. Careful assessment for program advancement will also be necessary. The experience during this pandemic shows that virtual learning and telemedicine will have a considerable impact on the future of surgical education.","Ellison, E Christopher; Spanknebel, Kathryn; Stain, Steven C; Shabahang, Mohsen M; Matthews, Jeffrey B; Debas, Haile T; Nagler, Alisa; Blair, Patrice Gabler; Eberlein, Timothy J; Farmer, Diana L; Sloane, Richard; Britt, L D; Sachdeva, Ajit K",J.

The concurrent COVID-19 pandemic and national attention on racism exposed shortcomings in the environmental research field's conceptualization and methodological use of race, which have subsequently hindered the ability of research to address racial health disparities. By the workshop's conclusion, the authors deduced that the utility of environmental aging biomarkers-aging biomarkers shown to be specifically influenced by environmental exposures-would be greatly diminished if these biomarkers are developed absent of considerations of broader societal factors-like structural racism-that impinge on racial health equity. OBJECTIVES: The authors reached a post-workshop consensus recommendation: To advance racial health equity, a ""compound"" exposome approach should be widely adopted in environmental aging biomarker research. We present this recommendation here. DISCUSSION: The authors believe that without explicit considerations of racial health equity, people in most need of the benefits afforded by a better understanding of the relationships between exposures and aging will be the least likely to receive them because biomarkers may not encompass cumulative impacts from their unique social and environmental stressors. Employing an exposome approach that allows for more comprehensive exposure-disease pathway characterization across broad domains, including the social exposome and neighborhood factors, is the first step. Exposome-centered study designs must then be supported with efforts aimed at increasing the recruitment and retention of racially diverse study populations and researchers and further ""compounded"" with strategies directed at improving the use and interpretation of race throughout the publication and dissemination process. This compound exposome approach maximizes the ability of our science to identify environmental aging biomarkers that explicate racial disparities in health and best positions the environmental research community to contribute to the elimination of racial health disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8392.","Nwanaji-Enwerem, Jamaji C; Jackson, Chandra L; Ottinger, Mary Ann; Cardenas, Andres; James, Katherine A; Malecki, Kristen M C; Chen, Jiu-Chiuan; Geller, Andrew M; Mitchell, Uchechi A",Environ Health Perspect,602,1

The epidemiological features of the SARS, MERS, and new COVID-19 have revealed sex-dependent variations in the infection, frequency, treatment, and fatality rates of these syndromes. Females are likely less susceptible to viral infections, perhaps due to their steroid hormone levels, the impact of X-linked genes, and the sex-based immune responses. Although mostly inactive, the X chromosome makes the female's immune system more robust. The extra immune-regulatory genes of the X chromosome are associated with lower levels of viral load and decreased infection rate. Moreover, a higher titer of the antibodies and their longer blood circulation half-life are involved in a more durable immune protection in females. The activation rate of the immune cells and the production of TLR7 and IFN are more prominent in females. Although the bi-allelic expression of the immune regulatory genes can sometimes lead to autoimmune reactions, the higher titer of TLR7 in females is further associated with a stronger anti-viral immune response. Considering these sex-related differences and the similarities between the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, we will discuss them in immune responses against the ß-CoVs-associated syndromes. We aim to provide information on sex-based disease susceptibility and response. A better understanding of the evasion strategies of pathogens and the host immune responses can provide worthful insights into immunotherapy, and vaccine development approaches.","Rahimi, Golbarg; Rahimi, Bahareh; Panahi, Mohammad; Abkhiz, Shadi; Saraygord-Afshari, Neda; Milani, Morteza; Alizadeh, Effat",Int Immunopharmacol,602,20

The seasonal occurrence, temporal-spatial variation, potential compound source(s), and a risk assessment of this watershed, which is the largest drinking water source in the country, were investigated. Clarithromycin was detected most frequently (72.2%) with the greatest median concentration (0.151 ± 0.072 µg L-1), followed by carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole. The seasonality of the pharmaceuticals was observed, with higher concentrations and detection frequencies in spring than in summer and autumn; this was possibly caused by lower levels of microbial activities associated with lower water temperatures than other seasons. In terms of geographical variation, urban areas had higher pharmaceutical concentrations than rural areas, which was attributed to the former's high population density and largest wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) regardless of season. The total concentration and detection frequency of WWTPs were 12.4 and 2.5 times higher in downstream sites than upstream sites, thereby conveying that WWTPs were the main source for the presence of pharmaceuticals in tributaries.

510578,510578,510578,Reflection on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus during the pandemic period of COVID-19,18.1497,6.352459,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. This novel coronavirus emerged in China, quickly spreading to more than 200 countries worldwide. Although most patients are only mildly ill or even asymptomatic, some develop severe pneumonia and become critically ill. One of the biggest unanswered questions is why some develop severe disease, whilst others do not. Insight on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system and the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression will be instrumental to the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, risk factors for worst outcome, and rational design of effective therapies and vaccines. In this review we have gathered the knowledge available thus far on the epidemiology of SARS-COV-2 infection, focusing on the susceptibility of older individuals, SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction during infection and the immune response directed at SARS-CoV-2. Dendritic cells act as crucial messengers linking innate and adaptative immunity against viral infections. Thus, this review also brings a focused discussion on the role of dendritic cells and their immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection and how immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and advancing age mediate dendritic cell dysfunctions that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and increased susceptibility to worst outcomes. This review brings to light the hypothesis that concomitant occurrence of dendritic cell dysfunction/cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and/or aging may influence disease outcome in the elderly. Lastly, a detailed discussion on the effects and mechanisms of action of drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 on the function of dendritic cells is also provided.","Borges, Rodrigo Cerqueira; Hohmann, Miriam Sayuri; Borghi, Sergio Marques",Int Rev Immunol,602,16

No caso brasileiro, os governos estaduais anteciparam-se com a decretação de medidas de fechamento de escolas, suspensão de eventos públicos e restrição do comércio. O objetivo deste paper é analisar as diferenças entre os governos estaduais do Brasil relativamente à implementação de intervenções não farmacêuticas (NPIs) para o enfrentamento ao coronavírus, com base no cálculo de um índice de ação governamental. Tendo em vista a consecução deste objetivo geral, foram analisados 367 decretos de 25 executivos estaduais brasileiros nos dois primeiros meses da pandemia no país (final de fevereiro e final de abril). Os resultados preliminares desta análise sugerem diferentes níveis de rigor das medidas para o enfrentamento à COVID-19 por parte dos governos estaduais brasileiros, destacando-se a adoção proativa de políticas mais rigorosas de distanciamento social por alguns estados, antes mesmo da confirmação do primeiro caso da doença em seus domínios.","Schaefer, Bruno Marques; Resende, Roberta Carnelos; Epitácio, Sara de Sousa Fernandes; Aleixo, Mariah Torres",Rev. adm. pública (Online),602,12

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Healthy pregnant women are more susceptible to developing COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed clinical data from pregnant patients with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to two tertiary care hospitals in Turkey. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, maternal and neonatal outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 24 pregnant women were enrolled in this study. The mean maternal and gestational age was 26.9±5.37 years and 24.15±10.61 weeks, respectively. Cough was observed as the most common symptom (n=15; 62.5 %). The lowest lymphocyte percentage was 20.83±13.05 (%). Nine women have delivered by Caesarean section, while one had a vaginal birth. One woman with critical COVID-19 died 2 days later postpartum. The neonate had been transferred to neonatal intensive care unit and died within 24 hours of birth. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that except for one patient, the clinical course of COVID-19 during pregnancy was mild. Early hospitalization of pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19, liberal testing for SARS-CoV-2, active management with a multidisciplinary team seemed to be critical to recovery (Tab. 3, Ref. 31).","Ozsurmeli, M; Terzi, H; Hocaoglu, M; Bilir, R A; Gunay, T; Unsal, D; Turgut, A; Karateke, A",Bratisl Lek Listy,602,16

Methods: This study was carried out according to three dimensions. In the first, the actual number of infected people was estimated. In the second, the expected total numbers of infected people, deaths, hospitalizations have been predicted in the case of no intervention. In the third, the distribution of the expected number of infected people and deaths, and ICU and non-ICU bed needs over time has been predicted via a SEIR-based simulator (TURKSAS) in four scenarios. Results: According to the number of deaths, the estimated number of infected people in Turkey on March 21 was 123,030. In the case of no intervention the expected number of infected people is 72,091,595 and deaths is 445,956, the attack rate is 88.1%, and the mortality ratio is 0.54%. The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to be exceeded by 4.4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity by 3.21-fold. In the second and third scenarios compliance with NPIs makes a difference of 94,303 expected deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below Turkey's capacity. Discussion: Predictions show that around 16 million people can be prevented from being infected and 94,000 deaths can be prevented by full compliance with the measures taken.

We sought to estimate and compare the COVID-19 CFR in Canada and the United States while adjusting for 2 potential biases in crude CFR. METHODS: We used the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada and the US from Jan. 31 to Apr. 22, 2020. We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%-50%). RESULTS: Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%-6.4%). After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%-3.1%). The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%-6.9%). With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%-3.6%). INTERPRETATION: Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%. The CFR estimates for the US were higher than those for Canada, but the adjusted CFR still remained below 2%.

It extends knowledge in effective support by examining themes of friendship communication between widows and their friends rather than widows' individual perceptions, and co-construction of support communication. Findings indicate that when social support is constructed between individuals with a focus on the specific relationship, support is highly valued. General support that does not consider the individual or relationship between widow and other is seen as unhelpful. It concludes by suggesting future research on social support take a dyadic approach.","Huisman, Dena M; Lemke, Allison",Omega (Westport),602,5

By combining atomic force microscopy AFM and quartz crystal microbalance, we show that at low ionic strengths the conformational change of grafted polyions is non-monotonic with increasing pH due to the counterintuitive variation of the ionization degree. Thus, reentrant swelling of the polymer chains is observed with increasing pH. This effect is more important at low polymer grafting densities, when it is accompanied by in-plane heterogeneous distribution at intermediate pH values. In addition, we observed self-assembly on the polymer brush (formation of holes and islands) at pH values below pKa, due to the short-range attractive interaction between uncharged grafted chains. The sensitivity of the ionization of grafted chains to the physicochemical environment was also studied by measuring the interaction force between a silica tip and polymer brushes by atomic force microscopy. The dependence of the ionization of polyions on the presence of the tip points toward important charge regulation effects, in particular at pH values corresponding to partial ionization of the polyion.","Senechal, Vincent; Saadaoui, Hassan; Vargas-Alfredo, Nelson; Rodriguez-Hernandez, Juan; Drummond, Carlos",,602,2

We show that hypercortisolemia represents one of the probable causes of acute lymphocytopenia at the onset of severe/critical conditions. Comparison of the transcriptomes of the bronchoalveolar microenvironment and peripheral blood indicates alveolar macrophages, alveolar epithelial cells, and monocytes in lungs as the potential main sources of elevated cytokines mediating systemic immune responses and organ damages.

The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. RESULTS: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, IgG reactivity was more frequent in younger individuals (p=0.043), while IgM reactivity was more frequent in individuals aged >45 years (p=0.002). DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the start of the outbreak. The pattern of IgM/IgG reactivity was influenced by age: IgM was more frequently detected in participants aged >45 years. By the end of April, 2.4-9.0% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion.","Valenti, Luca; Bergna, Annalisa; Pelusi, Serena; Facciotti, Federica; Lai, Alessia; Tarkowski, Maciej; Lombardi, Angela; Berzuini, Alessandra; Caprioli, Flavio; Santoro, Luigi; Baselli, Guido; Ventura, Carla Della; Erba, Elisa; Bosari, Silvano; Galli, Massimo; Zehender, Gianguglielmo; Prati, Daniele","Blood transfus.

History of close contacted with COVID-19 confirmed patient was reported, and the wife of our case was also RT-PCR tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the next few days strengthen the COVID-19 diagnosis of our case patient. It is important to use the combination of RT-PCR, chest X-ray, chest CT scan, clinical manifestations, antibodies test, and exposure history of patients to diagnose COVID-19 and decide the early isolation and appropriate treatment.","Soedarsono, Soedarsono; Febriani, Anna; Hasan, Helmia; Widyoningroem, Anita",,602,16

We evaluated the performance of bile-duodenal and Roux-en-Y bile-jejunal shunts with excluded loop of different lengths in the process of liver repair in rats with secondary biliary fibrosis. Thirty Wistar rats, after 15 days of biliary obstruction (BO), were divided into 5 groups of 6 animals: the BO group, duodenal shunt group (BDS) and with jejunal shunt, with excluded loop of 5 cm (BJS5 group), 10 cm (BJS10 group) and 15 cm (BJS15 group), and reevaluated 3 months later. Six animals were submitted to sham surgery (SHAM group). All animals were submitted to qualitative and morphometric histological evaluations of the liver, to blood biochemical and to microbiological bile analysis, and to a study of hepatic mitochondrial function. Liver and spleen weights (g/kg body weight) were also determined. In the statistical analysis, the level of significance was set at 5%. The animals of the BO group showed a significant increase in median values of total bilirubins (9.6 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase (AP) (296 U/ml) and aminotransferases (133 U/ml for ALT and 419 U/ml for AST) compared to the SHAM group.with normalization after all the shunt modalities used. A significant increase in liver and spleen weight occurred in the BO group (medians of 49.85 and 5.71, respectively) compared to the SHAM group (medians of 30.0 and 3.04 g/kg). There was a significant regression of liver weight in all the treatments, whereas spleen weight regressed only in the animals treated with a BJS (median values of 2.53 for BJS5, 2.82 for BJS10 and 2.93 for BJS15). There was a significant increase in estimated weight (g/kg body weight) of bile ducts, of fibrosis and of hepatocytes in animals of BO group (medians of 1.30; 10.03 and 37.0, respectively) compared to animals of SHAM group (medians of 0.03; zero and 29.37). There was a significant regression of estimated weight of bile ducts and of fibrosis, with respective median values of 0.22 and 0.22 in BDS group, of 0.45 and 3.31 in BJS5 group, and of 0.22 and 5.0 in BJS15 group. There was a significant regression of estimated hepatocyte weight only in BJS5, BJS10 and BJS15 groups, with median values of 31.93, 24.46 and 28.52 g/kg body weight. In all types of treatment a mixed inflammatory infiltrate occurred in the portal spaces, associated with enterobiliary reflux and with bacterial contamination of the bile. There was a significant increase in oxygen consumption by hepatic mitochondria in states 3 and 4 in BO group (respective medians of 101.55 and 31.05 nanoatoms O2/mg protein/min) compared to SHAM group (medians of 57.22 and 15.51). The O2 consumption normalized only in the animals of BJS15 group (medians of 52.38 and 14.8). The performance of the BJS indicates the importance of the evaluation of alternatives that might minimize the contact of enteric content with the biliary tree.","Pandolfi Jr., H.; Santos, J.

Many health-care facilities are prioritizing their services, and hence, those suffering from life-limiting conditions will have difficulty in accessing health services. Aims: The aim of the study was to perform a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of the palliative care (PC) services provided by the Institute of Palliative Medicine (IPM), Kozhikode, amid COVID-19 pandemic. Settings and Design: A SWOT analysis of PC services provided by IPM. Subjects and Methods: The data for SWOT analysis was collected by brainstorming and review of records and registers. Results: Good prioritization and documentation system and routinely adhering to infection control practices are notable strengths. Lack of funding and interrupted supply of personal protective equipment are notable weaknesses. Availability of established communication channels with active community participation are a few opportunities available to improve the services. Working with high-risk groups, return of Non-residential Indians (NRI), lack of transparency and stigma among the general public are the threats that can affect the service delivery. Conclusions: Having good prioritization and documentation system, reinforcing infection control practices, already established emergency homecare system, presence of a well-developed network of community-based PC services, and a vast network of community volunteers and awareness and cooperation of families had helped IPM to quickly reorganize its services and transition smoothly to continue to provide PC for those suffering from life-limiting illnesses in this pandemic situation.","Mathews, Lulu; Immanuel, Terrymize; Krishnadas, Nisha",Indian J.

OBJECTIVE: In this retrospective study we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, ferritin, LDH and D-dimer in predicting positive cases of COVID-19 in Iraq. METHODS: It is a retrospective observational cohort study based on STARD guidelines to determine the diagnostic accuracy of (CRP, LDH, ferritin and D dimer) for COVID-19 of electronic medical records of private medical center in Najaf city, at which 566 individuals were recruited. The investigated subjects were either in close contact with previously COVID-19 positive patients or have one or more symptoms of COVID-19. They were categorized into 2 groups, 205 subjects diagnosed with RT-PCR as COVID-19 negative, and 361 COVID-19 positive patients, results of study variables of the cohort were recruited from the medical records. RESULTS: Combining of these parameters had the following findings: CRP + ferritin; AUC: 0.77 with 55% sensitivity and 97% specificity, Ferritin + LDH; AUC: 0.83 with 65% sensitivity and 92% specificity, CRP+LDH; AUC: 0.78 with 56% sensitivity and 98% specificity, CRP + LDH + ferritin; AUC: 0.85, with 73% sensitivity and 88% specificity, CRP + LDH + ferritin + D dimer; AUC: 0.85 75% sensitivity and 87% specificity. CONCLUSION: Combination of routine laboratory biomarkers (CRP, LDH and ferritin ±D dimer) can be used to predict the diagnosis of COVID-19 with an accepted sensitivity and specificity before proceeding to definitive diagnosis by RT-PCR.","Kaftan, Ahmed N.; Hussain, Majid K.; Algenabi, Abdulhussein A.; Naser, Farah H.; Enaya, Muslim A.",Acta Inform Med,602,20

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eight hospitals in Southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: 3219 hospitalised patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal PCR test from 13 March 2020 until 29 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes were discharge from the hospital or in-hospital death. Examined predictors included patient demographics, chronic diseases, home medications, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital medications and timeframe of hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 3219 (90.4%) patients were discharged or died in the hospital. The median age was 65.2 (IQR 52.6–77.2) years, the median length of stay in the hospital was 6.0 (IQR 3.2–10.1) days, and 51% were female. Hypertension was the most common chronic disease, occurring in 2386 (74.1%) patients. Overall mortality rate was 16.0%. Blacks represented 52.3% of patients and had a mortality rate of 13.5%. Mortality was highest at 18.5% in the prepeak hospital COVID-19 volume, decreasing to 15.3% during the peak period and to 10.8% in the postpeak period. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.05, p<0.001) for every increase in 1 year of age and being male (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.81, p<0.001). Certain chronic diseases increased the odds of in-hospital mortality, especially chronic kidney disease. Administration of vitamin C, corticosteroids and therapeutic heparin in the hospital was associated with higher odds of death. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality was highest in early admissions and improved as our experience in treating patients with COVID-19 increased. Blacks were more likely to get admitted to the hospital and to receive mechanical ventilation, but less likely to die in the hospital than whites.","Mulhem, Elie; Oleszkowicz, Andrew; Lick, David",BMJ Open,602,20

This study aimed to explore psychological adjustment processes of Spanish adolescents and their parents during the first month of lockdown by analyzing their narratives, perceived outcomes, protection and risk factors. A total of 142 people agreed to participate in this study. Of all participants, 61 were adolescents (M = 13.57; SD = 1.74; 57% women) and 81 were parents (M = 46.09; SD = 4.72; 91% mothers). All were Spanish residents and completed an online survey during the domestic lockdown in March 2020. From a qualitative design, methodology followed a mixed approach to analyze data. The results showed three different types of adaptation to lockdown and social isolation in both adolescents and their parents: 1) positive adjustment, 2) moderate adjustment, and 3) maladjustment. Most participants reported a good adjustment and only a 20% of parents and a 16% of adolescents stated that they had not been able to achieve a positive psychological adjustment. There are few significant quantitative differences between adolescents and their parents. The qualitative analysis of data showed that adolescents reported less psychological distress than their parents. The two most important protective factors were social support and keeping busy during lockdown. The most significant risk factors were loss of mobility and social isolation. The conclusions stressed that regarding psychological maladjustment, parents experienced feelings of uncertainty whereas adolescents experienced a kind of mourning process. These findings can be used to design and implement effective intervention measures for mental health and psychological well-being in such a difficult situation as domestic lockdown.","Postigo-Zegarra, Silvia; Julián, Martín; Schoeps, Konstanze; Montoya-Castilla, Inmaculada",PLoS One,602,1

Using computational and conceptual text analysis, we examined more than 6,000 English-language posts on Twitter to establish the relative presence of different topics. Then, we assessed their levels of toxicity and sentiment polarity as an indication of contention and controversy. We find first that meat consumption and dietary options became one of the most discussed issues on Twitter in response to the IPCC report, even though it was a relatively minor element of the report; second, this new issue of controversy (meat and diet) had similar, high levels of toxicity to strongly contentious issues in previous IPCC reports (skepticism about climate science and the credibility of the IPCC). We suggest that this is in part a reflection of increasingly polarized narratives about meat and diet found in other areas of public discussion and of a movement away from criticism of climate science towards criticism of climate solutions. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of these findings for the work of the IPCC in anticipating responses to its reports and responding to them effectively.

The objective of the study was to measure the levels of IgG antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 during the peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Odisha State, India to know the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, the prevalence of herd immunity in the population, the distribution of IgG-positive cases examined according to ABO blood groups and the number of blood donors with higher neutralizing IgG antibody titre who later on were converted into Plasma Donors donating Convalescent Plasma (CP). Method: This observational prospective study was conducted for a duration of three months on 1032 number of Blood donors consisting of 1025 number of males and 07 number of females. The samples of donors were subjected to Electro- chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Result: Out of 1032 Donors, 370(35.9%) were SARS-COV-2 IgG positive which included 303 donors (29.36%) with neutralizing antibody titre of SARS-COV2 IgG antibodies above 1:80. SARS-COV-2 IgG positive cases consisted of 367(35.8%) male and 3(42.9%) female donors. The number of IgG positive cases were highest in 21-40 years’ age group i.e. 323 out of 869(37.2%). In terms of Blood group, 145(42.4%) out of 342 were from B RhD positive group. Out of 22 donors who were positive with COVID 19 in the past with neutralizing IgG antibody titre more than 1:80, 6(27.3%) persons came for voluntary convalescent plasma(CP) donation. Conclusion: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population and development of innate immunity against the virus. Policy makers can add the protocol of antibody testing in the screening of blood donors to enhance the number of Plasma Donation cases for the treatment of serious COVID patients.","Mahapatra, Smita",Transfus Clin Biol,602,12

We evaluated to what extent these changes have affected quality of life and physical, and psychosocial wellbeing of people (being) treated for breast cancer. Methods: This study was conducted within the prospective Utrecht cohort for Multiple BREast cancer intervention studies and Long-term evaluation (UMBRELLA). Shortly after the implementation of COVID-19 measures, extra questionnaires were sent to 1595 cohort participants, including standard UMBRELLA quality of life (EORTC) questionnaires. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared to the most recent PROs collected within UMBRELLA before COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 on PROs was evaluated using mixed models analysis. Results: In total, 1051 patients (66%) completed the questionnaires. One third (n = 327, 31%) reported a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19. A significant deterioration in emotional functioning was observed (82.6 to 77.9, p < 0.001) and 505 (48%, 95% CI 45-51) patients reported moderate to severe loneliness.

However, definitive criteria for treatment decisions have not yet been established. We investigate a potentially useful relatively non-invasive biomarker, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), to predict favorable responses to budesonide or montelukast, common treatment for children with asthma. METHODS: Young children (1 to 6 years old) were enrolled in this randomized, parallel, 2-group, open-label trial. Criteria for eligibility included: 1) being symptomatic during the run-in period; and 2) having a serum EDN (sEDN) level ≥ 53 ng/mL, with positive specific immunoglobulin E to house dust mite. Eligible patients were randomly placed into 2 groups: the BIS group received budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) 0.5 mg once daily; the MONT group received montelukast 4 mg once daily. Ineligible patients were invited to receive montelukast 4 mg once daily (OBS group). Treatment period was 12 weeks. RESULTS: Asthma control days increased significantly in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000) over the 12-week study period. There was no significant change in sEDN in the BIS group but there was a significant decrease in the MONT group (P < 0.000). Patients in the OBS group with high EDN levels (< 53 ng/mL) showed a significant decrease due to MONT treatment (P = 0.023). Rescue medication usage significantly decreased in the BIS and MONT groups (P < 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: EDN is a useful relatively non-invasive biomarker for predicting responses to montelukast and budesonide treatment of preschool children with beta2-agonist responsive recurrent wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze (Trial registry at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000008335).","Kim, Chang-Keun; Callaway, Zak; Park, Jin-Sung; Nishimori, Hisashi; Ogino, Tikatoshi; Nagao, Mizuho; Fujisawa, Takao",Allergy Asthma Immunol Res,602,1

METHODS: A total of 976 patients admitted to the emergency department of our hospital and had undergone neurology consultation during a 6-month period were evaluated. The reasons for consultation, the number of patients consulted, hospitalization counts, and imaging studies for neurological assessment including computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-pandemic period, there were significant decreases in the number of neurological consultations requested by the emergency department (overall and related to stroke, seizure and other reasons) and the number of patients hospitalized in the neurology department. We also found that the number of orders for cranial CT and MRI images during the pandemic period had decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: Restrictions, social isolation measures and patients’ reluctance to apply to hospitals to avoid contact with possibly infected people may have led to a decrease in the number of patients with neurological symptoms admitted to the emergency department and the number of hospitalized patients.","Haki, Cemile; Kaya, Halil",Acta Neurol Belg,602,1

METHODS: Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weight-mismatched canine pairs. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without cardiopulmonary bypass; group 2, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and in which the cardiopulmonary bypass flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration. Hemodynamic parameters and lung function were monitored for 6 hours after reperfusion. The grafts were harvested for histologic studies, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time quantitive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of mRNA encoding interleukin 6. RESULTS: The hemodynamic parameters were similar among the 3 groups. In group 1 Pao(2) and alveolar to arterial gradient for O(2) levels were excellent throughout the 6-hour observation period, but in group 2 they progressively deteriorated. However, ultrafiltration significantly (P = .02) improved the Pao(2) level in group 3. On histology, interstitial edema and polynuclear cell infiltration were most marked in group 2 and significantly worse than in groups 1 and 3. Myeloperoxidase assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed increased myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression in group 2 grafts compared with group 1 grafts. Myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression were suppressed with ultrafiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiopulmonary bypass had negative effects on the graft, but ultrafiltration attenuated acute lung dysfunction by reducing the inflammatory response.","Saitoh, Masayuki; Tsuchida, Masanori; Koike, Terumoto; Satoh, Koichi; Haga, Manabu; Aoki, Tadashi; Toyabe, Shin-ichi; Hayashi, Jun-ichi",J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,602,20

Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses is largely unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic but would inform strategies to rapidly and accurately test patients with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: This study retrospectively examined 298,415 respiratory specimens collected from symptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the three months since COVID-19 was initially documented in the province of Alberta, Canada (March-May, 2020). By focusing on 52,285 specimens that were also tested with the Luminex Respiratory Pathogen Panel for 17 other pathogens, this study examines the prevalence of 18 potentially co-circulating pathogens and their relative rates in prior years versus since COVID-19 emerged, including four endemic coronaviruses. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 2.2% of all specimens. Parallel broad multiplex testing detected additional pathogens in only 3.4% of these SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens: significantly less than in SARS-CoV-2-negative specimens (p < 0.0001), suggesting very low rates of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Furthermore, the overall co-infection rate was significantly lower among specimens with SARS-CoV-2 detected (p < 0.0001). Finally, less than 0.005% of all specimens tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and any of the four endemic coronaviruses tested, strongly suggesting neither co-infection nor cross-reactivity between these coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Broad respiratory pathogen testing rarely detected additional pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens. While helpful to understand co-circulation of respiratory viruses causing similar symptoms as COVID-19, ultimately these broad tests were resource-intensive and inflexible in a time when clinical laboratories face unprecedented demand for respiratory virus testing, with further increases expected during influenza season. A transition from broad, multiplex tests toward streamlined diagnostic algorithms targeting respiratory pathogens of public health concern could simultaneously reduce the overall burden on clinical laboratories while prioritizing testing of pathogens of public health importance. This is particularly valuable with ongoing strains on testing resources, exacerbated during influenza seasons.","Marshall, Natalie C.; Kariyawasam, Ruwandi M.; Zelyas, Nathan; Kanji, Jamil N.; Diggle, Mathew A.",Virol J,602,1

Vaccines have now appeared, but the challenges in producing sufficient material and distributing them around the world means that effective treatments to limit infection and improve recovery are still urgently needed. This review is focused on the relevance of different glycobiological molecules that could potentially serve as or inspire therapeutic tools during SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, we highlight the glycobiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection process, where glycans on viral proteins and on host glycosaminoglycans have critical roles in efficient infection. We also take notice of the glycan-binding proteins involved in the infective capacity of virus and in human defense. In addition, we critically evaluate the glycobiological contribution of candidate drugs for COVID-19 therapy such as glycans for vaccines, anti-glycan antibodies, recombinant lectins, lectin inhibitors, glycosidase inhibitors, polysaccharides, and numerous glycosides, emphasizing some opportunities to repurpose FDA-approved drugs. For the next generation drugs suggested here, biotechnological engineering making new probes to block the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be based in the essential glycobiological insight on glycosyltransferases, glycans, glycan-binding proteins and glycosidases related to this pathology.","Lardone, Ricardo D.; Garay, Yohana C.; Parodi, Pedro; Fuente, Sofia de la; Angeloni, Genaro; Bravo, Eduardo O.; Schmider, Anneke K.; Irazoqui, Fernando J.",J Biol Chem,602,1

Mitochondrial fission, fusion, and membrane potential play a central role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and the overall shape of mitochondria. Viruses change the dynamics of the mitochondria by altering the mitochondrial processes/functions, such as autophagy, mitophagy, and enzymes involved in metabolism. In addition, viruses decrease the supply of energy to the mitochondria in the form of ATP, causing viruses to create cellular stress by generating ROS in mitochondria to instigate viral proliferation, a process which causes both intra- and extra-mitochondrial damage. SARS-COV2 propagates through altering or changing various pathways, such as autophagy, UPR stress, MPTP and NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, these pathways act as potential targets for viruses to facilitate their proliferation. Autophagy plays an essential role in SARS-COV2-mediated COVID-19 and modulates autophagy by using various drugs that act on potential targets of the virus to inhibit and treat viral infection. Modulated autophagy inhibits coronavirus replication; thus, it becomes a promising target for anti-coronaviral therapy.

Despite the cancellation of most elective orthopedic and plastic surgical procedures, hand surgeons around the world continue to see a steady stream of limb-threatening cases such as severe trauma and infections that require emergent surgical care. With the increase in community-spread, an increasing number of COVID-19 infected patients may be asymptomatic or have mild, non-specific or atypical symptoms. Some of them may already have an ongoing, severe infection. The time-sensitive nature of some of these cases means that hand surgeons may need to operate urgently on patients who may be suspected of COVID-19 infections, often before confirmatory test results are available. General guidelines for peri-operative care of the COVID-19 positive patient have been published. However, our practices differ from general orthopedic and plastic surgery, primarily because of the focus on trauma. This article discusses the peri-operative and technical considerations that are essential to manage the COVID-19 patient requiring emergency care, without compromising clinical outcomes and while ensuring safety of the attending staff.","De, Soumen Das; Chang Liang, Zhen; Eu-Jin Cheah, Andre; Puhaindran, Mark Edward; Lee, Ellen Yutan; Tang Lim, Aymeric Yu; Sze Chong, Alphonsus Khin",J Hand Surg Am,602,26

This hypothesis suggests that a deficiency of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) may be the primary factor related to the SARS-Cov-2 disease spectrum and the risk for mortality, as subclinical nutritional deficiencies may be unmasked by any significant increase in oxidative stress. NAD(+) levels decline with age and are also reduced in conditions associated with oxidative stress as occurs with hypertension, diabetes and obesity. These groups have also been observed to have high mortality following infection with COVID-19. Further consumption of NAD(+) in a pre-existent depleted state is more likely to cause progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of the disease through its limiting effects on the production of SIRT1. This provides a unifying hypothesis as to why these groups are at high risk of mortality and suggests that nutritional support with NAD(+) and SIRT1 activators, could minimise disease severity if administered prophylactically and or therapeutically. The significance of this, if proven, has far-reaching consequences in the management of COVID-19 especially in third world countries, where resources and finances are limited.","Miller, R.; Wentzel, A.R.; Richards, G.",Med Hypotheses,602,26

This has facilitated ‘smart surveillance’ followed by required field response within a timeline. The system facilitated data collection of individual case, data driven mapping and strategies for malaria elimination programme. This paper aims to present the analysis of post-digitization data of 5 years, discuss the current operational functionalities of MCS and its impact on the malaria incidence. METHODS: IT system developed for robust malaria surveillance and field response is being continued in the sixth year. Protocol for surveillance control was followed as per the national programme guidelines mentioned in an earlier publication. Secondary data from the malaria control system was collated and analysed. Incidence of malaria, active surveillance, malariogenic conditions and its management, malariometric indices, shrinking malaria maps were also analysed. RESULTS: Smart surveillance and subsequent response for control was sustained and performance improved in five years with participation of all stakeholders. Overall malaria incidence significantly reduced by 83% at the end of 5 years when compared with year of digitization (DY) (p < 0.001). Early reporting of new cases (within 48 h) was near total followed by complete treatment and vector control. Slide positivity rate (SPR) decreased from 10.36 (DY) to 6.5 (PDY 5). Annual parasite incidence (API) decreased from 16.17 (DY) to 2.64 (PDY 5). There was a negative correlation between contact smears and incidence of malaria. Five-year data analyses indicated declining trends in overall malaria incidence and correlation between closures by 14 days. The best impact on reduction in incidence of malaria was recorded in the pre-monsoon months (~ 85%) compared to lower impact in July–August months (~ 40%). CONCLUSION: MCS helped to micromanage control activities, such as robust reporting, incidence-centric active surveillance, early and complete treatment, documentation of full treatment of each malaria patient, targeted mosquito control measures in houses surrounding reported cases. The learnings and analytical output from the data helped to modify strategies for control of both disease and the vector, heralding the city into the elimination stage.","Baliga, B.

The current study aimed to investigate whether IFN-λs are involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. METHODS: TaqMan allele discrimination assays were used to determine IFNL3/4 SNP genotypes of 1620 healthy controls and 1013 SLE patients (two independent cohorts consisting of 831 and 182 subjects, respectively) from Taiwan. The distributions of IFNL3/4 SNP genotypes and allele frequencies were compared between SLE patients and healthy controls and among SLE patients stratified by clinical phenotypes. ELISA was used to determine the serum IFN-λ3 concentrations of SLE patients. RESULTS: All major IFN3/4 SNP alleles were significantly associated with the risk for lupus nephritis (rs8099917T, P(FDR) = 0.0021, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24–2.47; rs12979860C, P(FDR) = 0.0034, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.18–2.30; rs4803217C, P(FDR) = 0.0021, OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.25–2.48; and ss469415590TT, P(FDR) = 0.0021, OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.23–2.42) among SLE patients. Similarly, the major IFNL3/4 SNP haplotype rs8099917T-ss469415590TT-rs12979860C-rs4803217C (or T-TT-C-C) was a significant risk factor for lupus nephritis (P = 0.0015, OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.22–2.32). Additionally, all minor IFN3/4 SNP alleles were significantly associated with SLE susceptibility in nephritis-negative SLE patients as compared to normal healthy controls (rs8099917G, P(FDR) = 0.00177, OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.24–2.28; rs12979860T, P(FDR) = 0.00299, OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18–2.32; rs4803217A, P(FDR) = 0.00176, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.22–2.23; and ss469415590ΔG, P(FDR) = 0.00176, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26–2.29). Furthermore, the elevated serum levels of IFN-λ3 were significantly correlated with the complement depression and the high SLE disease activities in SLE patients. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-λ3/4 genetic variants play a unique role in the development of lupus nephritis and SLE.

Therefore, it is critical to intervene early to prevent chronic and debilitating trajectories. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the study protocol of a CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)-compliant randomized controlled trial for evaluating the effectiveness of the Mind your Mate program, a mobile health (mHealth) peer intervention that aims to prevent mental health (focusing on anxiety and depression) and substance use problems in adolescents. METHODS: Participants will consist of approximately 840 year 9 or year 10 students (60 students per grade per school) from 14 New South Wales high schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be recruited from a random selection of independent and public schools across the New South Wales Greater Sydney Area by using publicly available contact details. The intervention will consist of 1 introductory classroom lesson and a downloadable mobile app that will be available for use for 12 months. Schools will be randomly allocated to receive either the mHealth peer intervention or a waitlist control (health education as usual). All students will be given web-based self-assessments at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcomes of the trial will be the self-reported use of alcohol and drugs, anxiety and depression symptoms, knowledge about mental health and substance use, motives for not drinking, and willingness to seek help. Secondary outcomes will include positive well-being, the quality of life, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses will be conducted using mixed-effects linear regression analyses for normally distributed data and mixed-effects logistic regression analyses for categorical data. RESULTS: The Mind your Mate study was funded by an Australian Rotary Health Bruce Edwards Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from 2019 to 2022. Some of the development costs for the Mind your Mate intervention came from a seed funding grant from the Brain and Mind Centre of the University of Sydney. The enrollment of schools began in July 2020; 12 of 14 schools were enrolled at the time of submission. Baseline assessments are currently underway, and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The Mind your Mate study will generate vital new knowledge about the effectiveness of a peer support prevention strategy in real-world settings for the most common mental disorders in youth. If effective, this intervention will constitute a scalable, low-cost prevention strategy that has significant potential to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders.

A remaining concern associated with their production is the potential introduction of adventitious agents into their manufacturing process, which may compromise the pathogen safety of a product and potentially cause stock‐out situations for important medical supplies. To ensure the safety of biological therapeutics, regulatory guidance requires adventitious agent testing (AAT) of the bulk harvest. AAT is a deliberately promiscuous assay procedure which has been developed to indicate, ideally, the presence of any viral contaminant. One of the most important cell lines used in the production of biopharmaceuticals is Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and while viral infections of CHO cells have occurred, a systematic screen of their virus susceptibility has never been published. We investigated the susceptibility of CHO cells to infection by 14 different viruses, including members of 12 families and representatives or the very species that were implicated in previously reported production cell infections. Based on our results, four different infection outcomes were distinguished, based on the possible combinations of the two factors (i) the induction, or not, of a cytopathic effect and (ii) the ability, or not, to replicate in CHO cells. Our results demonstrate that the current AAT is effective for the detection of viruses which are able to replicate in CHO cells. Due to the restricted virus susceptibility of CHO cells and the routine AAT of bulk harvests, our results provide re‐assurance for the very high safety margins of CHO cell‐derived biopharmaceuticals.

It is proposed that it could be used to display direct retrieval and the functional sequelae of COVID-19. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess the PCFS and to evaluate if age, gender, smoking, hospitalization, and comorbidities have any effect on functional limitations in recovered COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 444 registered confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. They were interviewed in our follow-up clinics and filled an Arabic translated PCFS scale as well as their demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: Eighty percent of COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible (63.1%), slight (14.4%), moderate (2%), to severe (0.5%) based on PCFS. Furthermore, there was a substantial variance between the score of PCFS with age (P = 0.003), gender (P = 0.014), the duration since the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 (P < 0.001), need for oxygen supplementation (P < 0.001), need for intensive care unit (ICU) admittance (P = 0.003), previous periodic influenza vaccination (P < 0.001), smoking status (P < 0.001), and finally, the presence of any comorbid disorder (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible to severe based on PCFS. These restrictions were affected by age, gender, periodic influenza vaccination, smoking, duration since symptoms onset, need for oxygen or ICU admittance, and finally the presence of coexisting comorbidity.","Mohamed Hussein, Aliae AR; Saad, Mahmoud; Zayan, Hossam E; Abdelsayed, Mustafa; Moustafa, Mohamed; Ezzat, Abdel Rahman; Helmy, Radwa; Abd-Elaal, Howaida; Aly, Karim; Abdelrheem, Shaimaa; Sayed, Islam",Ann Thorac Med,602,28

This study aimed to describe serum-IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of patients with both severe and mild COVID-19, including extended studies of patients who remained seronegative more than 90 days post symptom onset. Results: Forty-seven patients (mean age 49 years, 38% female) were included. All (15/15) patients with severe symptoms and 29/32 (90.6%) patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in serum. Time to seroconversion was significantly shorter (median 11 vs. 22 days, P=0.04) in patients with severe compared to mild symptoms. Of the three patients without detectable IgG-responses after >90 days, all had detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies and in two, spike-protein receptor binding domain-specific IgG was detected with an in-house assay. Antibody titers were preserved during follow-up and all patients who seroconverted, irrespective of the severity of symptoms, still had detectable IgG levels >75 days post symptom onset. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 both seroconvert earlier and develop higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients with mild symptoms. Of those patients who not develop detectable IgG antibodies, all have detectable virus-neutralizing antibodies, suggesting immunity. Our results showing that not all COVID-19 patients develop detectable IgG using two validated commercial clinical methods, even over time, are vital for the interpretation of COVID-19 seroprevalence surveys and for estimating the true infection prevalence in populations.","Marklund, Emelie; Leach, Susannah; Axelsson, Hannes; NordstrÃ¶m, Kristina; Norder, HelÃ©ne; Bemark, Mats; Angeletti, Davide; Lundgren, Anna; Nilsson, Staffan; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Yilmaz, Aylin; Lindh, Magnus; Liljeqvist, Jan-Ã ke; GisslÃ©n, Magnus",,602,16

Chronic exposure to endotoxins can induce and exacerbate airway symptoms and diseases. However, the release and degradation of airborne endotoxins from bioaerosol by microwave (MW) irradiation have not yet been reported. This study investigated the distribution and fate of airborne endotoxins during MW irradiation process, as well as the kinetics and thermodynamics of the degradation of airborne endotoxins. Results showed that MW irradiation induced cell lysis, thus considerably increasing the proportion of cells with ruptured membranes. Furthermore, MW irradiation changed the distribution of airborne endotoxins, sharply decreased the concentration of bound endotoxins from 230 EU/m(3) to 68 EU/m(3), and increased the concentration of free endotoxins from 21 EU/m(3) to 122 EU/m(3). These results indicated that MW irradiation released endotoxins from cells into the atmosphere. MW irradiation likely degraded endotoxins by exerting thermal effects, which achieved a total endotoxin removal efficiency of as high as 35%. Endotoxin degradation was a first-order reaction and required the activation energy of 26.3 kJ/mol.","Wang, C.; Zhang, Z.W.; Liu, H.",J Hazard Mater,602,9

Currently, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19 to reduce mortality. We investigated the potential anti-coronavirus activities from an oral liquid of traditional medicine, Respiratory Detox Shot (RDS), which contains mostly herbal ingredients traditionally used to manage lung diseases. RESULTS: Here we report that RDS inhibited the infection of target cells by lenti-SARS-CoV, lenti-SARS-CoV-2, and hybrid alphavirus-SARS-CoV-2 (Ha-CoV-2) pseudoviruses, and by infectious SARS-CoV-2 and derived Ha-CoV-2 variants including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.2, B.1.494, B.1.1.207, B.1.258, and B.1.1.298. We further demonstrated that RDS directly inactivates the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. In addition, we found that RDS can also block the infection of target cells by Influenza A virus.

The fear of the viral infection as well as the reorganisation of staff within the health services due to the pandemic caused a drop in patients’ attendance at CF centres. This resulted in a decrease in cultures performed, on which the definition of microbiological status is based. The ECFS definition of patients’ microbiological status (mainly the definition of chronic P. aeruginosa infection) is based on the modified Leeds criteria (>50% of the samples positive, at least 4 samples collected) or significantly raised anti-Pa antibodies. Following the different lockdown periods imposed in Tuscany in 2020 (March 9th – May 18th) we verified: • the number of outpatient visits to the Centre • the number of cultures performed compared with previous years • compliance with the criteria suggested by disease registries/standards of care for the definition of chronic infection • the utility of anti-Pa serology in the correct definition of chronic Pain the epidemic context Methods: Retrospective study on data regarding outpatient examinations, number of cultures performed and serology tests. Results: Outpatients’ attendance at the Centre (2020) [Table presented] % of patients with at least 4 cultures performed yearly. [Table presented] In 2020 we observed a significant reduction (p <0.05) in the mean number of cultures per patient and in the percentage of patients who performed at least 4 cultures. During 2020, 108 (29.2%) patients with fewer than 4 cultures performed Pa serology, 25 (23.1%) tested positive, completing the definition required by the ECFS. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a drop in patients’ attendance at the centre, compromising the correct definition of Pa chronic infection based on the number of cultures. In the pandemic context, serology could be a useful complementary test to correctly fulfill the ECFS definition.

This study first consolidates human studies in motion, intention, and preference into a discretized human model that can readily be used in robotics decision making algorithms. Cooperative Markov Decision Process (Co-MDP), a novel framework that improves upon Multiagent MDPs, is then proposed for enabling socially aware robot obstacle avoidance. Utilizing the consolidated and discretized human model, Co-MDP allows the system to (1) approximate rational human behavior and intention, (2) generate socially-aware robotic obstacle avoidance behavior, and (3) remain robust to the uncertainty of human intention and motion variance. Simulations of a human-robot co-populated environment verify Co-MDP as a feasible obstacle avoidance algorithm. In addition, the anthropomorphic behavior of Co-MDP was assessed and confirmed with a human-in-the-loop experiment. Results reveal that participants can not directly differentiate agents that were controlled by human operators from Co-MDP, and the reported confidences of their choices indicates that the predictions from participants were backed by behavioral evidence rather than random guesses. Thus the main contributions for this paper are: consolidating past human studies of rational human behavior and intention into a simple, discretized model; the development of Co-MDP: a robotic decision framework that can utilize this human model and maximize the joint utility between the human and robot; and an experimental design for evaluation of the human acceptance of obstacle avoidance algorithms.","Smith, Trevor; Chen, Yuhao; Hewitt, Nathan; Hu, Boyi; Gu, Yu",Int J Soc Robot,602,1

Blood was collected to determine virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) titers and B and T lymphocyte activation status. Inguinal lymph node samples were collected and used to measure B lymphocyte proliferation. Splenocytes were isolated, from which antigen-specific cellular immune responses were detected via ELISpot, ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining. The results revealed that both types of polysaccharides induce more rapid changes and higher VNA titers than aluminum hydroxide. Flow cytometry assays revealed that the polysaccharides activated more B lymphocytes in the lymph nodes and more B and T lymphocytes in the blood than aluminum hydroxide. Antigen-specific cellular immune responses showed that IIP-2 strongly induced T lymphocyte proliferation in the spleen and high levels of cytokine secretion from splenocytes, whereas aluminum hydroxide induced proliferation in only a small number of lymphocytes and the secretion of only small quantities of cytokines.

We explore the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19, and put forward effective recommendations for epidemic prevention and control. We collected demographic characteristics, exposure history, and course of action of COVID-19 cases. We described the demographic and case characteristics of these cases to show the basic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in both provinces. Combined with the spatial analysis of confirmed cases, the distribution law of the number of confirmed cases in different regions was analyzed. We exhibit the relationship among COVID-19 cases with a transmission network. The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed through the transmission network. Mainly cases in Liaoning and Jilin provinces were imported cases from other provinces and the vast majority of these cases were related to Hubei province. The number of confirmed cases in different regions was positively correlated with their GDP and population. The main clinical symptoms of the cases were fever. Judge from the transmission network relationship between the 2 provinces, the transmission chain in Liaoning province contains fewer cases than that in Jilin province. The main transmission routes of the local cases in the 2 provinces were the family members, and the infection of the imported cases were mainly occurred in public places. It was estimated that the unidentified asymptomatic infected cases in the 2 provinces account for approximately 7.3% of the total number of infected cases.

At the same time, COVID-19 is commonly spread from animals to persons, but today it is transmitting among persons by adapting the structure. It is a severe virus and inappropriately resulted in a global pandemic. Radiologists utilize X-ray or computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose COVID-19 disease. It is essential to identify and classify the disease through the use of image processing techniques. So, a new intelligent disease diagnosis model is in need to identify the COVID-19. In this view, this paper presents a novel IoT enabled Depthwise separable convolution neural network (DWS-CNN) with Deep support vector machine (DSVM) for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification. The proposed DWS-CNN model aims to detect both binary and multiple classes of COVID-19 by incorporating a set of processes namely data acquisition, Gaussian filtering (GF) based preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, patient data will be collected in the data acquisition stage using IoT devices and sent to the cloud server. Besides, the GF technique is applied to remove the existence of noise that exists in the image. Then, the DWS-CNN model is employed for replacing default convolution for automatic feature extraction. Finally, the DSVM model is applied to determine the binary and multiple class labels of COVID-19. The diagnostic outcome of the DWS-CNN model is tested against Chest X-ray (CXR) image dataset and the results are investigated interms of distinct performance measures. The experimental results ensured the superior results of the DWS-CNN model by attaining maximum classification performance with the accuracy of 98.54% and 99.06% on binary and multiclass respectively.","Le, Dac-Nhuong; Parvathy, Velmurugan Subbiah; Gupta, Deepak; Khanna, Ashish; Rodrigues, Joel J.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical characteristics of 175 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected and analyzed. Univariate analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to select variables. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in COVID-19 progression. We established a nomogram to evaluate the probability of progression of the condition of a patient with COVID-19 to severe within three weeks of disease onset. The nomogram was verified using calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: A total of 18 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the laboratory parameters (P<.05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out 10 risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were age (OR 1.035, 95% CI 1.017-1.054; P<.001), CK level (OR 1.002, 95% CI 1.0003-1.0039; P=.02), CD4 count (OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.998; P=.002), CD8 % (OR 1.007, 95% CI 1.004-1.012, P<.001), CD8 count (OR 0.881, 95% CI 0.835-0.931; P<.001), and C3 count (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.945-24.691; P=.003).

RESULTS. Phospholipase A2 group VII (PLA2G7) was identified as a candidate biomarker in COVID-19. PLA2G7 was predominantly expressed by proinflammatory macrophages in lungs emerging with progression of COVID-19. In the validation stage, PLA2G7 was found in patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia, especially in severe pneumonia, rather than patients suffered mild H1N1 influenza infection. The positive rates of PLA2G7 ranging from 29.37% to 100.00% were positively correlated with not only viral loads in patients with COVID-19 but also severity of pneumonia in non COVID-19 patients. Although Ct values of PLA2G7 in severe pneumonia was siginificantly lower than that in moderate pneumonia (P=7.2e-11), no differences were observed in moderate pneumonia with COVID-19 between severe pneumonia without COVID-19 (P=0.81). Serum protein levels of PLA2G7, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), were further found to be elevated and beyond the upper limit of normal in patients with COVID-19, especially among the re-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS. We firstly identified and validated PLA2G7, a biomarker for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), was abnormally enhanced in COVID-19 patients at both nucletide and protein aspects. These findings provided indications into the prevalence of cardiovascular involvements seen in COVID-19 patients. PLA2G7 could be a hallmark of COVID-19 for monitoring disease progress and therapeutic response.","LI, Y.; JIANG, Y.; ZHANG, Y.; LI, N.; YIN, Q.; LIU, L.; LV, X.; LIU, Y.; LI, A.; FANG, B.; LI, J.; YE, H.; YANG, G.; CUI, X.; QU, Y.; LI, C.; LI, D.; WANG, S.; GAI, Z.; ZHAN, F.; LIANG, M.",,602,32

The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection. While the higher prevalence of asymptomatic disease among children makes symptom-based isolation strategies ineffective, asymptomatic patients do not in fact carry a reduced viral load. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of systematic surveillance testing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days. At this point, one or more large disease clusters can be expected to be detected, forcing schools to close again. These disease clusters, in turn, can be expected to propagate through the community, with potentially hundreds to thousands of additional cases resulting from each individual school cluster. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Given the current circumstances in the United States, the most likely outcome in the late fall is that students will be deprived of the benefits of in-person learning while having incurred a significant risk to themselves and their communities.","Johnson, K.

The CCV strains were: two ATCC reference strains, the Insavc-1 vaccine strain, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA) challenge strain, and two California field isolates (UCD-1 and UCD-2) from the 1970s. All six strains, downstream of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene, had sufficient size for an ORF 7b, and thus, none were transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-like since TGEV lacks ORF 7b. By sequence analysis of the variable domain at the 5′ end of the S gene, five of the six CCV strains had a high degree of identity with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). However, one CCV field isolate (UCD-1) was different and had a high degree of identity with the 5′ end of the TGEV S gene. This suggests that RNA recombination occurred at this site between antigenically related coronaviruses. The low passage field isolates, UCD-1 and UCD-2, varied in their initial infectivity for swine testicular cells suggesting that sequence differences in the variable domain of the S gene may account for biological variation among CCVs.","Wesley, Ronald D",Virus Res,602,16

In vivo PP1 does not exist as a free catalytic subunit but is always associated with at least one regulatory PP1-interacting protein (PIP) to generate a large set of distinct holoenzymes. Each PP1 complex controls the dephosphorylation of only a small subset of PP1 substrates. We screened the literature for genetically engineered mouse models and identified models for all PP1 isoforms and 104 PIPs. PP1 itself and at least 49 PIPs were connected to human disease-associated phenotypes. Additionally, phenotypes related to 17 PIPs were clearly linked to altered PP1 function, while such information was lacking for 32 other PIPs. We propose structural reverse genetics, which combines structural characterization of proteins with mouse genetics, to identify new PP1-related therapeutic targets.

However, determining UCS is a very tough, expensive, time consuming and destructive method and requires experienced workers. On the other hand, P-wave velocity (V(P)) determination is cheap, precise, non-destructive and easy. There are many established relationships between UCS and V(P) but mostly are low in range or proposed for multiple rock types of different origin. In this paper, the correlation of UCS with V(P) has been assessed based on the rocks' lithology. The methodology used in this analysis was centred on the previous studies database, lithology-based data disintegration and data integration to establish lithology based simple regression (SR) equations. A total of 37 previous studies databases were processed, and 12 characteristic regression equations have been determined based on the lithology. The lithological control was also determined using the principal component analysis (PCA), which categorised the data into diverse rock types. Artificial neural network (ANN) has been used as a robust predictive tool to estimate the UCS using the V(P) and rock type information.","Rahman, Tabish; Sarkar, Kripamoy",Rock Mech Rock Eng,602,20

We studied in the early phase of pandemic consecutive patients (N = 383) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, whose subsequent clinical course was classified as mild or severe, the latter being characterized by admission to intensive therapy unit or death. Five host gene polymorphisms (MERTK rs4374383, PNPLA3 rs738409, TLL-1 rs17047200, IFNL3 rs1297860, and INFL4 rs368234815) were assessed by using whole nucleic acids extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs. Specific protease cleavage sites of TLL-1 on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were predicted in silico. Male subjects and older patients were significantly at higher risk for a severe outcome (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively). By considering patients ≤65 years, after adjusting for potential confounding due to sex, an increased risk of severe outcome was found in subjects with the GG genotype of PNPLA3 (adj-OR: 4.69; 95% CI = 1.01–22.04) or TT genotype of TLL-1 (adj-OR=9.1; 95% CI = 1.45–57.3). In silico evaluation showed that TLL-1 is potentially involved in the Spike protein cleavage which is essential for viral binding and entry into the host cells using the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Subjects carrying a GG genotype in PNPLA3 gene might have a constitutive upregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and be more prone to tissue damage when infected by SARS-CoV-2. The TT genotype in TLL-1 gene might affect its protease activity on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, enhancing the ability to infect or re-infect host’s cells. The untoward effect of these variants on disease course is evident in younger patients due to the relative absence of comorbidities as determinants of prognosis. In the unresolved pathogenetic scenery of COVID-19, the identification of genetic variants associates with more prolonged course or with a severe outcome of infection would support the development of predictive tools useful to stratify subjects by risk class at presentation. Moreover, the individuation of key genes could contribute to a better understanding of the pathways involved in the pathogenesis, giving the basis for rational therapeutic approaches.","Grimaudo, Stefania; Amodio, Emanuele; Pipitone, Rosaria Maria; Maida, Carmelo Massimo; Pizzo, Stefano; Prestileo, Tullio; Tramuto, Fabio; Sardina, Davide; Vitale, Francesco; Casuccio, Alessandra; Craxì, Antonio",Front Cell Dev Biol,602,16

Objectives This study aimed to analyze echocardiographic manifestations in MIS-C. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 28 MIS-C, 20 healthy controls and 20 classic Kawasaki disease (KD) patients. We reviewed echocardiographic parameters in acute phase of MIS-C and KD groups, and during subacute period in MIS-C group (interval: 5.2 ± 3 days). Results Only 1 case in MIS-C (4%) manifested coronary artery dilatation (z score=3.15) in acute phase, showing resolution during early follow up. Left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function measured by deformation parameters, were worse in MIS-C compared to KD. Moreover, MIS-C patients with myocardial injury (+) were more affected than myocardial injury (-) MIS-C with respect to all functional parameters. The strongest parameters to predict myocardial injury in MIS-C were global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), peak left atrial strain (LAS) and peak longitudinal strain of right ventricular free wall (RVFWLS) (Odds ratio: 1.45 (1.08-1.95), 1.39 (1.04-1.88), 0.84 (0.73-0.96), 1.59 (1.09-2.34) respectively). The preserved LVEF group in MIS-C showed diastolic dysfunction. During subacute period, LVEF returned to normal (median: from 54% to 64%, p<0.001) but diastolic dysfunction persisted. Conclusions Unlike classic KD, coronary arteries may be spared in early MIS-C, however, myocardial injury is common. Even preserved EF patients showed subtle changes in myocardial deformation, suggesting subclinical myocardial injury. During an abbreviated follow-up, there was good recovery of systolic function but persistence of diastolic dysfunction and no coronary aneurysms. Condensed abstract Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an illness that resembles Kawasaki Disease (KD) or toxic shock, reported in children with a recent history of COVID-19 infection. This study analyzed echocardiographic manifestations of this illness. In our cohort of 28 MIS-C patients, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function were worse than in classic KD. These functional parameters correlated with biomarkers of myocardial injury. However, coronary arteries were typically spared. The strongest predictors of myocardial injury were global longitudinal strain, right ventricular strain, and left atrial strain. During subacute period, there was good recovery of systolic function, but diastolic dysfunction persisted.","Matsubara, Daisuke; Kauffman, Hunter L.; Wang, Yan; Calderon-Anyosa, Renzo; Nadaraj, Sumekala; Elias, Matthew D.; White, Travus J.; Torowicz, Deborah L.; Yubbu, Putri; Giglia, Therese M.; Hogarty, Alexa N.; Rossano, Joseph W.; Quartermain, Michael D.; Banerjee, Anirban",J Am Coll Cardiol,602,20

Here, all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations and Dynamical Network Theory of the wild-type and mutant RBD/ACE2 adducts disclose that while the N501Y mutation (UK variant) enhances the Spike’s binding affinity towards ACE2, the N501Y, E484K and K417N mutations (South African variant) aptly adapt to increase SARS-CoV-2 propagation via a two-pronged strategy: (i) effectively grasping ACE2 through an allosteric signaling between pivotal RBD structural elements; and (ii) impairing the binding of antibodies elicited by infected/vaccinated patients.

Its usefulness in people with acute asthma is unknown. Our aim was to assess the ability of the CCQ to detect viral infection and to monitor recovery during a viral induced asthma exacerbation and confirmed by virological testing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We studied subjects (≥7 yrs) admitted to hospital with acute asthma and diagnosed as positive (n = 63), or negative to viral infection (n = 27) according to molecular and virological testing from respiratory samples. CCQ, asthma history and asthma control questionnaires were completed and repeated 4–6 weeks later. Sensitivity, specificity, and response to change of the CCQ were assessed by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis and effect size calculation respectively. The CCQ did not discriminate between viral and non-viral infection for subjects with asthma (sensitivity = 76.2%; specificity = 29.6%). ROC analysis could not differentiate between positive or negative virus in subjects with asthma. The CCQ had a large response to change following recovery (effect size = 1.01). 39% of subjects recovering from viral exacerbation remained positive to virological testing at follow-up despite improvement in clinical symptoms. The CCQ reflected clinical improvement in these subjects, thus providing additional information to complement virological testing. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The CCQ is a useful instrument for monitoring response to viral infection in people with asthma. Reliable differentiation between viral and non-viral asthma exacerbations was not achieved with the CCQ and requires specific virological testing. When combined with virological testing, the CCQ should be a useful outcome measure for evaluating therapies in viral-induced asthma.","Powell, Heather; Smart, Joanne; Wood, Lisa G.; Grissell, Terry; Shafren, Darren R.; Hensley, Michael J.; Gibson, Peter G.",PLoS One,602,16

The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multi-center database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre- and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixty-five patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017–2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms (symptoms > 48h in 61% and 26%, p < 0,001), the intervention time (77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay (hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment (antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset.

The goal of this study was to systematically assess the usability of telemedicine in the field of pediatric gastroenterology. METHODS: The previously validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire was distributed to physician pediatric gastroenterologist members of North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition. Physician demographic and practice characteristics were collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive, linear mixed-effect, and ordinary least squares regression methods. RESULTS: One hundred sixty pediatric gastroenterologists completed the survey. The majority were from academic practice (77%) with experience ranging from trainee (11%) to over 20 years of clinical practice (34%). Most (82%) had no experience with telemedicine before the pandemic. The average usability score (scale 1–5) was 3.87 (σ = 0.67) with the highest domain in the usefulness of telemedicine (μ = 4.29, σ = 0.69) and physician satisfaction (μ = 4.13, σ = 0.79) and the lowest domain in reliability (μ = 3.02, σ = 0.87).

Of note, 20 (64%) hyperglycaemic and 11 (23.4%) normoglycaemic patients had diabetes (P < 0.01). At admission, hyperglycaemic vs normoglycaemic patients had fivefold higher IL-6 levels, which persisted even after TCZ administration (P < 0.05). Intriguingly, in a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P < 0.009). Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P < 0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

During COVID-19 restrictions, remote spotting (e.g., using a telephone, video call, and/or a social media app) emerged to address physical distancing requirements and reduced access to harm reduction and/or sexually transmitted blood borne infection (STBBI’s) prevention services. We explored spotting implementation issues from the perspectives of spotters and spottees. METHODS: Research assistants with lived/living expertise of drug use used personal networks and word of mouth to recruit PWUD from Ontario and Nova Scotia who provided or used informal spotting. All participants completed a semi-structured, audio-recorded telephone interview about spotting service design, benefits, challenges, and recommendations. Recordings were transcribed and thematic analysis was used. RESULTS: We interviewed 20 individuals between 08/2020–11/2020 who were involved in informal spotting. Spotting was provided on various platforms (e.g., telephone, video calls, and through texts) and locations (e.g. home, car), offered connection and community support, and addressed barriers to the use of supervised consumption sites (e.g., location, stigma, confidentiality, safety, availability, COVID-19 related closures). Spotting calls often began with setting an overdose response plan (i.e., when and who to call). Many participants noted that, due to the criminalization of drug use and fear of arrest, they preferred that roommates/friends/family members be called instead of emergency services in case of an overdose. Both spotters and spottees raised concerns about the timeliness of overdose response, particularly in remote and rural settings. CONCLUSION: Spotting is a novel addition to, but not replacement for, existing harm reduction services. To optimize overdose/COVID-19/STBBI’s prevention services, additional supports (e.g., changes to Good Samaritan Laws) are needed. The criminalization of drug use may limit uptake of formal spotting services.","Perri, Melissa; Kaminski, Natalie; Bonn, Matthew; Kolla, Gillian; Guta, Adrian; Bayoumi, Ahmed M.; Challacombe, Laurel; Gagnon, Marilou; Touesnard, Natasha; McDougall, Patrick; Strike, Carol",Harm Reduct J,602,32

Maternal blood and milk samples and blood samples from their babies were collected at 2-weekly intervals until 26 weeks after parturition. Samples were assayed for rotavirus antibodies by ELISAs and neutralisation tests. Vaccination produced statistically significant increases in maternal serum IgG and neutralising antibodies, and in milk IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibodies. Control baboon mothers sampled from 12 weeks after delivery had lower serum and milk antibody titres, but responded to vaccination at 16 weeks by producing a similar antibody profile in serum and milk to those previously vaccinated. Because of the endemic nature of human rotaviral infections, similar maternal vaccinations have potential as a means of increasing milk antibodies to a level at which they may be protective to infants.","Snodgrass, D.

With these new initiatives, it is conceivable that the diagnosis of cancer care may be delayed. We aimed to evaluate differences in patient populations being evaluated for cancer before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective review of our electronic medical record and examined patient characteristics of those presenting for a possible new cancer diagnosis to our urologic oncology clinic. Data was analyzed using logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: During the 3-month period before the COVID-19 pandemic began, 585 new patients were seen in one urologic oncology practice. The following 3-month period, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 362 patients were seen, corresponding to a 38% decline. Visits per week increased to pre-COVID-19 levels for kidney and bladder cancer as the county entered the green phase. Prostate cancer visits per week remained below pre-COVID-19 levels in the green phase. When the 2 populations pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 were compared, there were no notable differences on regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic decreased the total volume of new patient referrals for possible genitourinary cancer diagnoses. The impact this will have on cancer survival remains to be determined.","Maganty, Avinash; Yu, Michelle; Anyaeche, Vivian I.; Zhu, Toby; Hay, Jordan M.; Davies, Benjamin J.; Yabes, Jonathan G.; Jacobs, Bruce L.",Urol Oncol,602,24

A total of 54 adult cancer survivors were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 26) and control groups (n = 27) with assessments at baseline, 9, and 15 weeks via self-administered survey. The response rate was 91% at 9 weeks and 58% at 15 weeks. The majority of our study participants were female breast cancer survivors (58%) who had overweight or obesity (65%). Compared with the control, there were significant (p < 0.05) increases in intervention participants’ knowledge about a plant-based diet at weeks 9 and 15, reductions in perceived barriers to eating more fruits and vegetables at week 9, and enhanced confidence and skills in preparing a plant-based diet at week 15. There was a significant reduction in processed meat intake but changes in other food groups and psychosocial measures were modest. Participation in CCK in person increased knowledge, skills, and confidence and reduced barriers to adopting a plant-based diet.

Targeting these aspects of SARS-CoV-2 is important as the pandemic affects greater proportions of the population. In clinical and animal studies, fucoidans have been shown to increase innate immunity and decrease inflammation. In addition, dietary fucoidan has been shown to attenuate pulmonary damage in a model of acute viral infection. Direct inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro has been described, but is not universal.

This forced many affected countries to take stringent measures such as complete lockdown, shutting down businesses and trade, as well as travel restrictions, which has had a tremendous economic impact. Therefore, having knowledge and foresight about how a country might be able to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be of paramount importance to the government, policy makers, business partners and entrepreneurs. To help social and administrative decision making, a model that will be able to forecast when a country might be able to contain the spread of COVID-19 is needed. RESULTS: The results obtained using our long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based model are promising as we validate our prediction model using New Zealand’s data since they have been able to contain the spread of COVID-19 and bring the daily new cases tally to zero. Our proposed forecasting model was able to correctly predict the dates within which New Zealand was able to contain the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, the proposed model has been used to forecast the dates when other countries would be able to contain the spread of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The forecasted dates are only a prediction based on the existing situation. However, these forecasted dates can be used to guide actions and make informed decisions that will be practically beneficial in influencing the real future. The current forecasting trend shows that more stringent actions/restrictions need to be implemented for most of the countries as the forecasting model shows they will take over three months before they can possibly contain the spread of COVID-19.

Respiratory infections have a relatively limited repertoire of clinical manifestations, so that there is often nothing characteristic enough about a specific infection to make the diagnosis obvious. Thus, the pathway to the diagnosis of infections that are not endemic in a region relies heavily on taking a thorough history of both itinerary and of specific exposures. One important caveat is that on occasion, the history of a recent trip creates an element of “tunnel vision” in the evaluating health-care provider. It is tempting to relate a person's problem to that recent trip; however, when evaluating recent returnees, it is always important to remember that the travel may have nothing to do with the patient's presentation. Recent travel may add diagnostic considerations to the list of possibilities, but an astute clinician must not disregard the possibility that the patient's illness has nothing to do with the recent trip.","Gluckman, Stephen J.",Chest,602,24

METHODS: A real setting longitudinal study (March to November 2020) in an ARD community cohort was carried out. Potential predictors of hospitalization for COVID-19 examined included (1) sociodemographic variables (age, gender, education, tobacco use, socioeconomic status, and co-inhabitants), (2) comorbidities, (3) time to COVID-19 diagnosis, and (4) ARD’s features: clinical (disease type, disease duration, activity), treatment [corticosteroids use/doses, use of synthetic DMARDs (cDMARDs, tsDMARDs, and bDMARDs)], treatment schedule and non-adherence, and the Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ). Univariable and multivariable regression analysis were conducted; OR and 95% CI (p < 0.05) were determined. RESULTS: One thousand and one hundred forty-eight patients with ARDs were included; 154 had COVID-19; of these 139 (90.3%) were women, aged 52.5 (13.7) years; 33.1% had hypertension and 61.0% an affected organ by ARD.

However, these contrast agents can induce injury, in both the kidneys and target organs themselves. Sulfobutylether beta cyclodextrin (SBECD) added to iohexol (SBECD‐iohexol) (Captisol Enabled‐iohexol, Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc, San Diego, CA) is currently in clinical trials in cardiovascular procedures, to determine its relative renal safety in high‐risk patients. Preclinical studies showed that SBECD‐iohexol reduced contrast‐induced acute kidney injury in rodent models by blocking apoptosis. The current study was undertaken to determine whether SBECD‐iohexol is also cardioprotective, in the male rat ischemia‐reperfusion model, compared to iohexol alone. METHODS: After anesthesia, the left coronary artery was ligated for 30 min and the ligation released and reperfusion followed for 2 h prior to sacrifice. Groups 1–4 were injected in the tail vein 10 min prior to ischemia with: (1) vehicle; (2) iohexol; (3) SBECD; and (4) SBECD‐iohexol. Infarct size, hemodynamics, and serum markers were measured. RESULTS: An eight‐fold increase in serum creatine kinase in the iohexol‐alone group was observed, compared with no increase in the SBECD‐iohexol group. The mean arterial pressure and rate pressure product were depressed in the iohexol‐alone group, but not in the SBECD‐iohexol group, or controls. No difference in infarct size or serum creatinine among the groups was observed. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that SBECD‐iohexol is superior to iohexol alone, for both the preservation of cardiomyocyte integrity and preservation of myocardial function in myocardial ischemia.","Rowe, Elizabeth S.; Rowe, Vernon D.; Hunter, John; Gralinski, Michael R.; Neves, Liomar A.",J Neuroimaging,602,21

Data were collected May 21 to July 15, 2020, from 3245 adults living in 5 major US metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York, New York; and Los Angeles, California). Participants were characterized as cisgender straight or LGBTQ+ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, and men who have sex with men, and women who have sex with women not identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender). Results. Cisgender straight participants had the lowest levels of depression, anxiety, and problem drinking compared with all other sexual orientation, sexual behavior, and gender identity groups, and, in general, LGBTQ+ participants were more likely to report that these health problems were ""more than usual"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions. LGBTQ+ communities experienced worse mental health and problem drinking than their cisgender straight counterparts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research should assess the impact of the pandemic on health inequities. Policymakers should consider resources to support LGBTQ+ mental health and substance use prevention in COVID-19 recovery efforts. (Am J Public Health.

HMPV has a worldwide distribution with infectivity rates approaching 100%, and immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk from viral exposure. No anti-HMPV vaccine is available and diagnosis is primarily based on in-house molecular or serological tests, in part due to limited availability of recombinant HMPV antigens. OBJECTIVE: To generate a panel of HMPV-derived recombinant antigens, develop standardised ELISA systems for HMPV IgG detection and explore the nature of B cell memory against HMPV to underpin future vaccine studies. STUDY DESIGN: HMPV viral RNA was isolated from a clinical specimen and RT-PCR was conducted. The HMPV M and P genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The HMPV N gene was cloned and expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Each purified recombinant antigens was subsequently employed in HMPV-specific ELISA. RESULTS: High-level expression, and purification, of both HMPV matrix (M) (10 mg/g cells) and phosphoprotein (P) (3.82 mg/g cells) were achieved in an E. coli expression system. Recombinant HMPV (N) was successfully expressed in, and purified from the baculovirus expression system. Overall, a 99% HMPV IgG seroprevalence was observed (n = 96) using HMPV M-, N- and P-ELISA, respectively. The M antigen proved to be the most diagnostically useful with 99% of specimens tested exhibiting anti-M protein reactivity. A high correlation was observed between anti-M and N IgG reactivity (r = 0.96), with significant correlation also evident for anti-N and P IgG reactivity (r = 0.74). Lowest correlation was evident for anti-M and P IgG reactivity (r = 0.57). Finally, the first demonstration of HMPV-specific B cell memory (ranging 1–15 spot forming cells (SFC)/million cells) was achieved against M and P antigens in 40% of individuals tested. CONCLUSION: This work describes robust diagnostic systems for HMPV and new insight into antigen-specific B cell memory against HMPV.","O'Shaughnessy, Luke; Carr, Michael; Crowley, Brendan; Carberry, Stephen; Doyle, Sean",J Clin Virol,602,26

For example, based on U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey (HPS) data, CDC reported significant increases in symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults aged ≥18 years during August 19, 2020-February 1, 2021, with the largest increases among adults aged 18-29 years and among those with less than a high school education (1). To assess more recent national trends, as well as state-specific trends, CDC used HPS data (4) to assess trends in reported anxiety and depression among U.S. adults in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) during August 19, 2020-June 7, 2021 (1). Nationally, the average anxiety severity score increased 13% from August 19-31, 2020, to December 9-21, 2020 (average percent change [APC] per survey wave = 1.5%) and then decreased 26.8% from December 9-21, 2020, to May 26-June 7, 2021 (APC = -3.1%). The average depression severity score increased 14.8% from August 19-31, 2020, to December 9-21, 2020 (APC = 1.7%) and then decreased 24.8% from December 9-21, 2020, to May 26-June 7, 2021 (APC = -2.8%). State-specific trends were generally similar to national trends, with both anxiety and depression scores for most states peaking during the December 9-21, 2020, or January 6-18, 2021, survey waves. Across the entire study period, the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms was positively correlated with the average number of daily COVID-19 cases.

Recommendation by the Center for Disease Control to suspend elective dental procedures and avoid aerosol-generating procedures posed significant challenges in the management of patients presenting with endodontic emergencies and uncertainty of outcomes for endodontic procedures initiated, but not completed, prior to shutdown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the success of palliative care on endodontic emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the stability of teeth with long-term Ca(OH)(2) placement due to delays in treatment completion. METHODS: Patients presenting for endodontic emergencies during COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place orders received palliative care, including pharmacological therapy and/or non-aerosol generating procedural interventions. Part I of the study evaluated the effectiveness of palliative care and need for aerosol-generating procedures or extractions were quantified. Part II of the study evaluated survivability and rate of adverse events for teeth that received partial or full root canal debridement and placement of calcium hydroxide prior to shutdown. RESULTS: Part I: Twenty-one patients presented with endodontic emergencies in 25 teeth during statewide shutdown. At a follow up rate of 96%, 83% of endodontic emergencies required no further treatment or intervention after palliative care. Part II: Thirty-one teeth had received partial or full root canal debridement prior to statewide shutdown. Mean time to complete treatment was 13 weeks. At a recall rate of 100%, 77% of teeth did not experience any adverse events due to delays in treatment completion. The most common adverse event was a fractured provisional restoration (13%), followed by painful and/or infectious flare up (6.4%) which were managed appropriately and therefore seemed successful. Only one tooth was fractured and non-restorable (3%) leading to a failed outcome of tooth extraction. The remaining four outcome failures (13%) were due to patient unwillingness to undergo school-mandated COVID testing or patient unwillingness to continue treatment due to perceived risk of COVID infection. Conclusions: Palliative care for management of endodontic emergencies is a successful option when aerosol-generating procedures are restricted. This treatment approach maybe be considered in an effort to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19 infection during subsequent shutdowns. Prolonged Ca(OH)(2) medicament due to COVID-19 related delays in treatment completion appeared to have minimal effect on survival of teeth.","Patel, B.; Eskander, M.A.; Ruparel, Nikita B.",J Endod,602,1

Pathogen discovery programs of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in wildlife have implicated rodents and shrews as hosts of diverse human pathogens, such as hantaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, etc. Despite these threats, little is known about the diversity of viruses circulating among rodents and shrews in Kenya, meaning the risk of infectious disease outbreak from these small mammals could be oblivious. This study reports the first surveillance toward understanding the diversity of RNA viruses carried by rodents and shrews in areas of high-potential contact with humans in Kenya through molecular detection. A total of 617 samples comprising fecal, urine, and tissues from 138 rodents and 5 shrews were screened for eight different families of viruses using RT-PCR assays. The results highlight the presence of diverse astroviruses, paramyxoviruses, hepeviruses, and arenavirus, circulating in both wild and synanthropic Kenyan rodents and shrews. Most of the viruses detected in this study are novel strains and some belong to the families that contain important human viral pathogens. Notably, a novel arenavirus was detected in Grammomys macmillani, a rodent species newly identified to harbor arenavirus, and it potentially represent a novel arenavirus species. Our findings demonstrate the need for continued pathogen surveillance among these small mammals as well as among the vulnerable and exposed livestock and humans. This would help in development and implementation of effective preventive and control strategies on EIDs in countries with rich wildlife biodiversity like Kenya.","Onyuok, Samson Omondi; Hu, Ben; Li, Bei; Fan, Yi; Kering, Kelvin; Ochola, Griphin Ochieng; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Obanda, Vincent; Ommeh, Sheila; Yang, Xing-Lou; Agwanda, Bernard; Shi, Zheng-Li",Front Microbiol,602,6

A subset of patients with chronic cough are troubled with a cough that persists despite optimal treatment of presumed associated common and uncommon conditions (refractory chronic cough; RCC) or in which no diagnosable cause for cough can be identified despite extensive assessment (unexplained chronic cough; UCC). Many of these patients exhibit clinical features of cough hypersensitivity, including laryngeal paresthesia, hypertussia, and allotussia. Over‐the‐counter cough remedies are ineffective and can lead to intolerable side effects when used for RCC/UCC, and the lack of approved treatments indicated for these conditions reflects a major unmet need. An increased understanding of the anatomy and neurophysiology of protective and pathologic cough has fostered a robust clinical development pipeline of several targeted therapies for RCC/UCC. This manuscript reviews the mechanisms presumed to underly RCC/UCC together with the rationale and clinical evidence for several targeted therapies currently under clinical investigation, including transient receptor potential channel antagonists, P2X3‐receptor antagonists, voltage‐gated sodium channel blockers, neuromodulators, and neurokinin‐1–receptor antagonists. Finally, we provide an overview of targets that have been investigated in preclinical models of cough and other airway diseases that may hold future promise for clinical studies in RCC/UCC.

Limited data are available in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Purpose To determine the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. Methods We studied consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to general ward at Strasbourg Hospital, France (25.02.2020–19.04.2020). The primary outcome was any VTE complication. The secondary outcome was the composite of death or transfer to ICU. Results Among the 289 patients included (62.2±17.0 years, 59.2% male), VTE occurred in 49 (17.0%). Padua prediction score for VTE was similar between VTE and non-VTE patients. VTE imaging tests were performed in 100 (34.6%) patients and VTE diagnosed in median 7 (3–11) days after admission. On-admission, time from symptom onset to admission (OR 1.07, CI 95% [1.00–1.16], P =0.045), Improve score (OR 1.37, [1.02–1.83], P =0.032), leukocyte count (OR 1.16, [1.06–1.27], P =0.001) and lack of thromboprophylaxis (OR 27.85, CI 95% [9.35–82.95], P <0.001) were independent predictors of VTE. The incidence of the composite of death or ICU transfer was 31.0% and more frequent among patients with VTE (47.9% vs. 27.9%, P =0.01). Fever (OR 5.37, CI 95% [1.44–19.97], P =0.012), VTE (OR 3.44, CI 95% [1.63–7.25], P =0.001), lymphopenia (OR 0.32, 95% CI [0.15–0.71]; P =0.005) and extent of COVID-19 evaluated by chest CT severity (OR 1.56, 95% CI [1.12–2.16]; P =0.007) were independently associated with in-hospital death or transfer to ICU (Table 1, Fig. 1).

VAFRACT trial evaluates the additional benefit of LVAD echo‐guided optimization (EO) on functional capacity (FC), measured by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and quality of life (QoL). METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty‐seven patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to EO (EO group) vs. standard settings (CONTROL group) at least after 3 months from LVAD implant procedure. The optimal device speed was defined as the one that allows an intermittent aortic valve opening and a neutral position of the interventricular septum without increasing aortic or tricuspid regurgitation and preserving right ventricular function. The primary endpoint was peak oxygen uptake (VO(2) peak) change after 3 months. Echo‐guided optimization significantly improves VO(2) peak (from 13.2 ± 2.5 to 14.2 ± 2.5 mL/kg/min; P < 0.001), oxygen pulse (from 9.75 ± 1.46 to 10.75 ± 2.2 mL; P < 0.001), CPET exercise time (from 490 ± 98 to 526 ± 116 s; P = 0.02), 6 min walk distance (from 363 ± 54 to 391 ± 52 m; P = 0.04), and QoL, using EuroQol Five Dimensions 3L (from 0.796 ± 0.1 to 0.85 ± 0.08; P < 0.001) and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (from 81.6 ± 6.9 to 84.6 ± 5.6; P = 0.025).

Its effects on delivery of diagnostic care for cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide, have not been quantified. OBJECTIVES: The study sought to assess COVID-19’s impact on global cardiovascular diagnostic procedural volumes and safety practices. METHODS: The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a worldwide survey assessing alterations in cardiovascular procedure volumes and safety practices resulting from COVID-19. Noninvasive and invasive cardiac testing volumes were obtained from participating sites for March and April 2020 and compared with those from March 2019. Availability of personal protective equipment and pandemic-related testing practice changes were ascertained. RESULTS: Surveys were submitted from 909 inpatient and outpatient centers performing cardiac diagnostic procedures, in 108 countries. Procedure volumes decreased 42% from March 2019 to March 2020, and 64% from March 2019 to April 2020. Transthoracic echocardiography decreased by 59%, transesophageal echocardiography 76%, and stress tests 78%, which varied between stress modalities. Coronary angiography (invasive or computed tomography) decreased 55% (p < 0.001 for each procedure). In multivariable regression, significantly greater reduction in procedures occurred for centers in countries with lower gross domestic product.

Previous attempts at reconstructing the entire history of the sudden oak death (SOD) epidemic in California were limited by: (1) incomplete sampling; (2) the inability to include infestations caused by a single genotype of the pathogen; (3) collapsing of non-spatially contiguous yet genetically similar samples into large meta-samples that confounded the coalescent analyses. Here, we employ an intensive sampling coverage of 832 isolates of Phytopthora ramorum (the causative agent of SOD) from 60 California forests, genotyped at nine microsatellite loci, to reconstruct its invasion. By using age of infestation as a constraint on coalescent analyses, by dividing genetically indistinguishable meta-populations into highly-resolved sets of spatially contiguous populations, and by using Bruvo genetic distances for most analyses, we reconstruct the entire history of the epidemic and convincingly show infected nursery plants are the original source for the entire California epidemic. Results indicate that multiple human-mediated introductions occurred in most counties and that further disease sources were represented by large wild infestations. The study also identifies minor introductions, some of them relatively recent, linked to infected ornamental plants. Finally, using archival isolates collected soon after the discovery of the pathogen in California, we corroborate that the epidemic is likely to have resulted form 3 to 4 core founder individuals evolved from a single genotype. This is probably the most complete reconstruction ever completed for an invasion by an exotic forest pathogen, and the approach here described may be useful for the reconstruction of invasions by any clonally reproducing organism with a relatively limited natural dispersal range.

SMILE is a free online access medical education (FOAMEd) platform. SMILE delivered 200 lectures during lockdown with up to 1400 students per session from UK medical schools and 33 abroad. Here we discuss student perceptions to SMILE during lockdown METHOD: A survey was used to collect information from students who had utilised the platform during lockdown. This examined access to learning, impact on mental health during lockdown and the differences between FOAMed and more traditional based campus lecture-based learning. RESULTS: 1306 students responded to the survey. The majority of students were concerned regarding their training during lockdown, with 71% reporting an impact on their stress levels and 44% reporting a negative impact on mental health. On average students attended 4.3hours of teaching put on by their university per week, vs 7.9hours by SMILE. Positives included anonymity, making 80% more likely to both ask and answer questions, the informal approach, ease of access and enthusiastic teachers. Negatives included time differences and technical issues. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown provided challenges in medical education, which platforms like SMILE addressed. Our experiences highlighted many positive outcomes of online medical education that may be applicable to other educators.","Pascoe, J; Foster, P; Quddus, M; Kosti, A; Guest, F; Stevens, S; Bamford, R; Coulston, J",Br J Surg,602,28

The purpose of this study was to evaluate pulmonary vascular abnormalities 3 months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in patients with persistent respiratory symptoms. METHODS: Among the 320 patients who participated in a systematic follow-up 3 months after hospitalization, 76 patients had residual symptoms justifying a specialized follow-up in the department of pulmonology. Among them, dual-energy CT angiography (DECTA) was obtained in 55 patients. FINDINGS: The 55 patients had partial (n = 40; 72.7%) or complete (n = 15; 27.3%) resolution of COVID-19 lung infiltration. DECTA was normal in 52 patients (52/55; 94.6%) and showed endoluminal filling defects in 3 patients (3/55; 5.4%) at the level of one (n = 1) and two (n = 1) segmental arteries of a single lobe and within central and peripheral arteries (n = 1). DECT lung perfusion was rated as non-interpretable (n = 2;3.6%), normal (n = 17; 30.9%) and abnormal (n = 36; 65.5%), the latter group comprising 32 patients with residual COVID-19 opacities (32/36; 89%) and 4 patients with normal lung parenchyma (4/36; 11%). Perfusion abnormalities consisted of (a) patchy defects (30/36; 83%), (b) PE-type defects (6/36; 16.6%) with (n = 1) or without proximal thrombosis (n = 5); and (c) focal areas of hypoperfusion (2/36; 5.5%). Increased perfusion was seen in 15 patients, always matching GGOs, bands and/or vascular tree-in- bud patterns. INTERPRETATION: DECT depicted proximal arterial thrombosis in 5.4% of patients and perfusion abnormalities suggestive of widespread microangiopathy in 65.5% of patients. Lung microcirculation was abnormal in 4 patients with normal lung parenchyma.","Remy-Jardin, Martine; Duthoit, Louise; Perez, Thierry; Felloni, Paul; Faivre, Jean-Baptiste; Fry, Stéphanie; Bautin, Nathalie; Chenivesse, Cécile; Remy, Jacques; Duhamel, Alain",EClinicalMedicine,602,6

Various components of the immune system, including neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), Ad specific T cells and type I IFN activated NK cells, contribute to dampening the efficacy of Ad vectors in individuals with pre-existing Ad immunity. In order to circumvent pre-existing immunity to adenovirus, numerous strategies, such as developing alternative Ad serotypes, varying immunization routes and utilizing prime-boost regimens, are under pre-clinical or clinical phases of development. However, these strategies mainly focus on one arm of pre-existing immunity. Selection of alternative serotypes has been largely driven by the absence in the human population of nAbs against them with little attention paid to cross-reactive Ad specific T cells. Conversely, varying the route of immunization appears to mainly rely on avoiding Ad specific tissue-resident T cells. Finally, prime-boost regimens do not actually circumvent pre-existing immunity but instead generate immune responses of sufficient magnitude to confer protection despite pre-existing immunity. Combining the above strategies and thus taking into account all components regulating pre-existing Ad immunity will help further improve the development of Ad vectors for animal and human use.","Fausther-Bovendo, Hugues; Kobinger, Gary P",Hum Vaccin Immunother,602,21

All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: −10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8 mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 – April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima.","Yunus, Ali P.; Masago, Yoshifumi; Hijioka, Yasuaki",The Science of the total environment,602,26

We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the reactive SIR (short-term and long-term reaction) model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term reaction to an outbreak corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term reaction. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak of daily fatality counts, which allows to gauge the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest that the proposed model is applicable not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty. Finally, we provide a web app (https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/covid-19/) with tools for visualising the phase space representation of real-world COVID-19 data and for exporting the preprocessed data for further analysis.","Gros, Claudius; Valenti, Roser; Schneider, Lukas; Gutsche, Benedikt; Marković, Dimitrije",PLoS One,602,1

The data are presented for common virus variants and the most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles. Binding affinities of HLA molecules and viral peptides were assessed with accurate in silico methods. The obtained results highlight the importance of taking HLA alleles diversity into account: mutation-mediated alterations in HLA-peptide interactions were highly dependent on HLA alleles. For example, we found that the essential number of peptides tightly bound to HLA-B*07:02 in the reference Wuhan variant ceased to be tight binders for the Indian (Delta) and the UK (Alpha) variants.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 3-month history of moderate-to-high fever was reported in an otherwise healthy 54-year-old man. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest showed a remarkable progressive enlargement of bilateral cervical, supraclavicular, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes within 2 weeks. Bronchofibroscopy manifested obvious luminal stenosis with swelling, thick pale mucosa, and disappearing of structures of trachea cricoid cartilage, followed by a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography–computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) with intense symmetric FDG uptake in larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and hilar, mediastinal, and axillary lymph nodes being demonstrated. DIAGNOSIS: A diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis (RP) was finally reached. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received methylprednisolone 40 mg daily with a gradual tapering in a 4-month follow-up. OUTCOMES: The patient experienced no relapse of fever and lymph nodes enlargement in the 4-month follow-up. LESSONS: Even though long-term fever with multiple lymphadenectasis usually lead to a diagnosis of lymphoma, the bronchoscopic features and evidence from 18F-FDG PET/CT in this case were much more approximate to RP, indicating an importance of a sensible differential diagnosis of RP in patients who present with nonspecific features such as FUO and lymph nodes enlargement. Keeping a high index of clinical suspicion in these patients can help recognize uncommon of RP and promote diagnosis and treatment. Our case highlights the significance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in helping reaching the diagnosis of RP in this condition. This report provides new data regarding the diagnostic difficulties of this rare type of autoimmune disease, and further investigations are needed as cases accumulate.","Liu, Wei; Jiang, Hongli; Jing, Han; Mao, Bing",Medicine (Baltimore),602,16

The most recent global burden of disease studies highlight that severe periodontitis is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory conditions affecting humans. Periodontitis risk is attributed to genetics, host-microbiome and environmental factors. Empirical diagnostic and prognostic systems have yet to be validated in the field of periodontics. Early diagnosis and intervention prevents periodontitis progression in most patients. Increased susceptibility and suboptimal control of modifiable risk factors can result in poor response to therapy, and relapse. The chronic immune-inflammatory response to microbial biofilms at the tooth or dental implant surface is associated with systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or gastrointestinal diseases. Oral fluid-based biomarkers have demonstrated easy accessibility and potential as diagnostics for oral and systemic diseases, including the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. Advances in biotechnology have led to innovations in lab-on-a-chip and biosensors to interface with oral-based biomarker assessment. This review highlights new developments in oral biomarker discovery and their validation for clinical application to advance precision oral medicine through improved diagnosis, prognosis and patient stratification. Their potential to improve clinical outcomes of periodontitis and associated chronic conditions will benefit the dental and overall public health.","Steigmann, Larissa; Maekawa, Shogo; Sima, Corneliu; Travan, Suncica; Wang, Chin-Wei; Giannobile, William V.",Front Pharmacol,602,24

The kinetics, magnitude and duration of virus-specific antibodies and the underlying B cell responses in people living with HIV (PLWH) in sub-Saharan Africa have not been fully characterized. METHODS We longitudinally followed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and characterized SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies weekly for a month, and then at 3 months post diagnosis. 7/30 (41.7%) were PLWH, 83% (25/30) of which were on ART and with full HIV suppression. Potency of convalescent plasma neutralization was determined using a live virus neutralization assay and antibody secreting cell population frequencies were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS Similar seroconversion rates, time to peak antibody titer, peak magnitude and durability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, IgA, were observed in HIV uninfected and PLWH with complete HIV suppression on ART. In addition, similar neutralization potency against an isolate of SARS-CoV-2, circulating at the time of sampling in the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in South Africa was observed in both groups. Loss of IgA was significantly associated with age (p=0.023) and a previous diagnosis of TB (p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS Similar antibody response kinetics and neutralization potency in HIV negative and PLWH on stable ART in an African setting suggests that COVID-19 natural infections may confer comparable antibody immunity in these groups.

Severe COVID-19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-related coagulopathy remain unknown. Since the risk of severe COVID-19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age, we combined proteomics data from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with human gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to identify gene products involved in coagulation that change with age, differ in their levels between females and males, and are regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This resulted in the identification of transferrin as a candidate coagulation promoter, whose levels increases with age and are higher in males than in females and that is increased upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. A systematic investigation of gene products associated with the GO term “blood coagulation” did not reveal further high confidence candidates, which are likely to contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy. In conclusion, the role of transferrin should be considered in the course of COVID-19 disease and further examined in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.","McLaughlin, Katie-May; Bechtel, Marco; Bojkova, Denisa; Wass, Mark N.; Michaelis, Martin; Cinatl, Jindrich",bioRxiv,602,10

This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain/Europe. Methods Maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses have been performed to estimate the most probable temporal and geographic origin of different phylogenetic clusters and the diffusion pathways of SARS-CoV-2. Results Phylogenetic analyses of the first 28 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained from patients in Spain revealed that most of them are distributed in G and S clades (13 sequences in each) with the remaining two sequences branching in the V clade. Eleven of the Spanish viruses of the S clade and six of the G clade grouped in two different monophyletic clusters (S-Spain and G-Spain, respectively), with the S-Spain cluster also comprising 8 sequences from 6 other countries from Europe and the Americas. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in the city of Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019, with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval from October 30-December 17, 2019.

Obesity, hypertension, and diabetes (all MetS components) are the most common form of CVD and represent risk factors for worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to their non MetS peers. Here, we use obese Yorkshire pigs as a highly relevant animal model of human MetS, where pigs develop the hallmarks of human MetS and reproducibly mimics the myocardial pathophysiology in patients. Myocardium-specific mass spectroscopy-derived metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics enabled the identity and quality of proteins and metabolites to be investigated in the myocardium to greater depth. Myocardium-specific deregulation of pro-inflammatory markers, propensity for arterial thrombosis, and platelet aggregation was revealed by computational analysis of differentially enriched pathways between MetS and control animals. While key components of the complement pathway and the immune response to viruses are under expressed, key N6-methyladenosin RNA methylation enzymes are largely overexpressed in MetS. Blood tests do not capture the entirety of metabolic changes that the myocardium undergoes, making this analysis of greater value than blood component analysis alone. Our findings create data associations to further characterize the MetS myocardium and disease vulnerability, emphasize the need for a multimodal therapeutic approach, and suggests a mechanism for observed worse outcomes in MetS patients with COVID-19 comorbidity.","Ziegler, Olivia; Sriram, Nivedita; Gelev, Vladimir; Radeva, Denitsa; Todorov, Kostadin; Feng, Jun; Selke, Frank W.; Robson, Simon C.; Hiromura, Makoto; Alexandrov, Boian S.; Usheva, Anny",Sci Rep,602,20

In addition, through diet, important substrates are acquired for the biosynthesis of regulatory molecules in the immune response, influencing the progression and treatment of chronic lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this way, nutrition can promote lung health status. A range of nutrients, such as vitamins (A, C, D, and E), minerals (zinc, selenium, iron, and magnesium), flavonoids and fatty acids, play important roles in reducing the risk of pulmonary chronic diseases and viral infections. Through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, nutrients are associated with better lung function and a lower risk of complications since they can decrease the harmful effects from the immune system during the inflammatory response. In addition, bioactive compounds can even contribute to epigenetic changes, including histone deacetylase (HDAC) modifications that inhibit the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, which can contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis in the context of infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. These nutrients also play an important role in activating immune responses against pathogens, which can help the immune system during infections. Here, we provide an updated overview of the roles played by dietary factors and how they can affect respiratory health. Therefore, we will show the anti-inflammatory role of flavonoids, fatty acids, vitamins and microbiota, important for the control of chronic inflammatory diseases and allergies, in addition to the antiviral role of vitamins, flavonoids, and minerals during pulmonary viral infections, addressing the mechanisms involved in each function. These mechanisms are interesting in the discussion of perspectives associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its pulmonary complications since patients with severe disease have vitamins deficiency, especially vitamin D. In addition, researches with the use of flavonoids have been shown to decrease viral replication in vitro. This way, a full understanding of dietary influences can improve the lung health of patients.","Gozzi-Silva, Sarah Cristina; Teixeira, Franciane Mouradian Emidio; Duarte, Alberto José da Silva; Sato, Maria Notomi; Oliveira, Luana de Mendonça",Front Nutr,602,28

Methods A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London. The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital. We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19. Results Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread. While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths. However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown. This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone. Conclusions A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections. This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale.","Goscé, Lara; Phillips, Professor Andrew; Spinola, P.; Gupta, Dr Rishi K.; Abubakar, Professor Ibrahim",J Infect,602,1

Through a group of vaccinated healthcare workers, we describe the qualitative and quantitative serological response to a single dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We found that, before the second dose inoculation, 95.3 % (182/191) already had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and, half of them, antibodies concentrations against RBD (the key target of neutralizing antibodies) that reached maximum values for the used evaluation immunoassay. In order to improve the execution of vaccination programs, further studies are needed to assess whether there are individuals for whom a single dose of mRNA vaccine or a delay in the inoculation of the second dose, produce a sufficient immune response.

Epidemiological research showed that gender was associated with the severity of COVID‐19, but the underlying mechanism of gender predisposition remains poorly understood. We aim to study the gendered differences in inflammation reaction, and the association with severity and mortality of COVID‐19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 548 COVID‐19 inpatients from Tongji Hospital from January 26 to February 5, 2020, and followed up to March 3, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical features, and inflammatory indexes were collected and compared between males and females. Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to identify gendered effect on mortality of COVID‐19 after adjusting age, comorbidity and smoking history. Multiple linear regression method was used to explore the influence of sex on inflammation reaction. RESULTS: Males had higher mortality than females did (22.2% vs. 10.4%), with the HR of 1.923 (95% CI, 1.181‐3.130); elder age and comorbidity were significantly associated with decease of COVID‐19 patients. Excess inflammation reaction was related to severity of COVID‐19. Male patients had greater inflammation reaction, with higher levels of IL‐10, TNF‐α, LDH, ferritin and hsCRP, but lower lymphocyte count than females adjusted by age and comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, age, and comorbidity are critical risk factors for mortality of COVID‐19. Excess innate immunity and proinflammation activity, and deficiency in adaptive immunity response promote males especially elder males to develop cytokine storm, causing potential ARDS, multiple organ failure and decease.

We share our institute's policy and our department's attempt to resume ”non-emergent” surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected details of all patients operated under department of neurosurgery since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in India and categorized them into ”lockdown” and ”unlock” groups for comparison. COVID-19 tests done in these patients were also analyzed. We also compared our surgical volume with the number of COVID-19 cases in the state. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients (97 males, 51 females) with mean age of 37.8 years (range-2 months-82 years) underwent surgery in our department during the study period. The operative volume per week increased by 37% during the ”unlock” period as compared to ”lockdown” period. The proportion of elective/”non-emergent” surgeries increased from 11.3% during ”lockdown” to 34.7% during the ”unlock” period (P = 0.0037). During ”lockdown” period, number of surgeries declined steadily as the number of COVID-19 cases rose in the state (rs(8) = −0.914, P = 0.000). Whereas there was a trend toward increased number of cases done per week despite increase in the number of cases in the state during the “unlock” period. During the ”unlocking” process, in-patient department admissions and surgeries performed per month increased (P = 0.0000) and this increase was uniform across all specialties. COVID-19 test was done (preoperatively or postoperatively) for all surgeries during ”unlock” period compared to 12 (22.6%) surgeries during ”lockdown” period. Three neurosurgery patients who underwent surgery during the ”unlock” period tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience shows that proper evidence-based protocols, setting up of adequate COVID-19 testing facilities and provision of ample personal protective equipments are instrumental in re-starting “nonemergent” surgeries.","Goyal, Nishant; Gupta, Kanav; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Swain, Srikant Kumar; Tomy, Akhil",Asian J Neurosurg,602,4

METHODS: Thirty-six American head and neck surgical oncology practices responded to questions regarding the triage strategies employed from March to May 2020. RESULTS: Of the programs surveyed, 11 (31%) had official department or hospital-specific guidelines for mitigating care delays and determining which surgical cases could proceed. Seventeen (47%) programs left the decision to proceed with surgery to individual surgeon discretion. Five (14%) programs employed committee review, and 7 (19%) used chairman review systems to grant permission for surgery. Every program surveyed, including multiple in COVID-19 outbreak epicenters, continued to perform complex head and neck cancer resections with free flap reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic experience in the United States, head and neck surgical oncology divisions largely eschewed formal triage policies and favored practices that allowed individual surgeons discretion in the decision whether or not to operate. Better understanding the shortcomings of such an approach could help mitigate care delays and improve oncologic outcomes during future outbreaks of COVID-19 and other resource-limiting events.

Usually, manufacturing production is guided by standards to segment and distribute its processes and implementations. However, industry 4.0 requires innovative proposals for disruptive technologies that engage the entire production process in factories, not just a partial improvement. One of these disruptive technologies is the Digital Twin (DT). This advanced virtual model runs in real-time and can predict, detect, and classify normal and abnormal operating conditions in factory processes. The Automation Pyramid (AP) is a conceptual element that enables the efficient distribution and connection of different actuators in enterprises, from the shop floor to the decision-making levels. When a DT is deployed into a manufacturing system, generally, the DT focuses on the low-level that is named field level, which includes the physical devices such as controllers, sensors, and so on. Thus, the partial automation based on the DT is accomplished, and the information between all manufacturing stages could be decremented. Hence, to achieve a complete improvement of the manufacturing system, all the automation pyramid levels must be included in the DT concept. An artificial intelligent management system could create an interconnection between them that can manage the information. As a result, this paper proposed a complete DT structure covering all automation pyramid stages using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to model each stage of the AP based on the Digital Twin concept. This work proposes a virtual model for each level of the traditional AP and the interactions among them to flow and control information efficiently. Therefore, the proposed model is a valuable tool in improving all levels of an industrial process. In addition, It is presented a case study where the DT concept for modular workstations underpins the development of technologies within the framework of the Automation Pyramid model is implemented into a didactic manufacturing system.","Martinez, Edwin Mauricio; Ponce, Pedro; Macias, Israel; Molina, Arturo",Sensors (Basel),602,20

The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case “zero” that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R(0))and the effective reproduction number (R(e)) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. METHODS: To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the “effective” per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R(0) and the evolution of the effective reproduction number R(e). To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to “forecast” the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. RESULTS: Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R(0) was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy. Furthermore the model predicted that until May 4, around 20% of the population in Lombardy has recovered (interquartile range: ∼10% to ∼30%).","Russo, Lucia; Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Tsakris, Athanasios; Bifulco, Gennaro Nicola; Campana, Emilio Fortunato; Toraldo, Gerardo; Siettos, Constantinos",PLoS One,602,1

Flavonoids abundantly present in the fruits and vegetables, especially quercetin, are shown to have antiviral activities. MAIN TEXT: This paper reviews the capability of the plant flavonoid quercetin to fight the novel coronavirus and the possibility for drug development based on this. The mode of action explaining the known pathways through which this molecule succeeds in the antiviral activity, action of quercetin on SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL(pro), antiviral activities of its derivatives on human viruses, effect of combination of zinc co-factor along with quercetin in the COVID-19 treatment, and the regulation of miRNA genes involved in the viral pathogenesis are discussed. Proof for this concept is provided following the virtual screening using ten key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2 and assessing their interactions. Active residues in the 3D structures have been predicted using CASTp and were docked against quercetin. Key proteins 3CL(pro), spike glycoprotein/ human ACE2-BOAT1 complex, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, main peptidase, spike glycoprotein, RNA replicase, RNA binding protein, papain-like protease, SARS papain-like protease/ deubiquitinase, and complex of main peptidase with an additional Ala at the N-terminus of each protomer, have shown the binding energies ranging between − 6.71 and − 3.37 kcal/ Mol, showing that quercetin is a potential drug candidate inhibiting multiple SARS-CoV-2 enzymes.

Those who survived face ongoing challenges, including socio-cultural constraints, economic hardship, post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), depression, and critical health issues, which may lead to suicidal ideation and death. The aim of this article is to explore why and how female garment workers who survived the Rana Plaza collapse are now at risk of suicide thoughts and behaviours, and suicide death. Unstructured face-to-face interviews were held from April to July 2018 with 11 female garment workers who survived the Rana Plaza building collapse. Interviews continued until data saturation was reached. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim while simultaneously being translated into English from Bengali/Bangla. Transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. The study found that all participants were living with multiple risk factors of suicidal ideation (including low socio-economic status, poverty, social stigma, psychological distress, and trauma) which the participants directly linked to the collapse of the Rana Plaza building. Our analysis uses the three-step theory of suicide (3ST, Klonsky & May, 2015) to understand female Rana Plaza survivors’ suicide risk. Female survivors’ overall vulnerability requires urgent attention while taking the socio-cultural setting of Bangladesh into account. In addition, a lifelong caring system (combining financial security and free healthcare) needs to be initiated to accommodate the female survivors with mainstream society to avoid possible future suicides. They require long-term social and economic security and psychological support.","Kabir, Humayun; Maple, Myfanwy; Islam, Md Shahidul; Usher, Kim",Int J Environ Res Public Health,602,1

We aimed to assess the prognostic value of elevated troponin above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) on mortality and factors affecting their relationship. Methods We performed a comprehensive literature search using PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Embase from inception of the search databases until 16th December 2020. The key exposure was elevated serum troponin, defined as troponin (of any type) elevation > 99th percentile URL. The outcome was mortality due to any causes. Results There were a total of 12,262 patients from 13 studies in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Mortality was present in 23% (20-26%) of the patients. Elevated troponin was present in 31% (23-38%) of the patients. Elevated troponin was associated with increased mortality (OR 4.75 [4.07, 5.53], p < 0.001; I2: 19.9%). Meta-regression shows that the association did not vary with age (p = 0.218), male gender (p = 0.707), hypertension (p = 0.182), diabetes (p = 0.906), and coronary artery disease (p = 0864).

The data were collected using a survey form related to the occurrence of SS disorders symptoms and standardized psychological questionnaires, such as the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)-10, Mini-Cope, and the type-D Scale (DS14), developed for the purpose of this study. Results: Women experiencing at least one of the SS disorder-related symptoms were characterized by a significantly higher level of stress and a type D personality (p < 0.05). Among men, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). On the basis of the strategies of coping with stress, i.e., positive self-reevaluation, discharging and blaming oneself, and taking psychoactive substances, it is possible to predict the intensity of stress during the pandemic in the group of the examined students. Among the reported symptoms of SS, headache was a significant predictor of stress, which was accompanied by an increase in the intensity of stress by nearly 0.2 measurement points. Students with higher levels of stress showed more symptoms of type D personality, and those with more severe symptoms of SS showed higher levels of stress. Conclusions: People prone to stress and having type D personality traits should be assessed for the presence of SS disorders.","Gębska, Magdalena; Kołodziej, Łukasz; Dalewski, Bartosz; Pałka, Łukasz; Sobolewska, Ewa",J Clin Med,602,32

As a level 1 trauma center located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Hennepin Healthcare (HCMC) offers a unique perspective into the changes in massive transfusion protocol (MTP) activations and usage during this tumultuous period. This may provide insight for addressing similar future events. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MTP logs from March 2020 to August 2020 were compared to logs from March to August 2019. The data were de‐identified, and MTP activations and component usage were categorized by activation reason. These categories were compared across the 2‐year period to examine the impact of COVID‐19, including stay‐at‐home orders, and civil unrest. RESULTS: For the examined 6 months of the year 2020, there were a total of 140 MTP activations, compared to 143 in 2019. There were more activations for violent trauma (VT) in 2020 than 2019 (44 vs. 32). This increase in activations for VT was offset by a decrease in non‐trauma activations (54 vs. 66). There was a significant increase in the number of components used in VT activations. DISCUSSION: During 2020, the initial mild decrease in MTP activations was followed by a dramatic increase in the number of activations and component usage for VT in June and July of that year.","Braun, Alexander L.; Gorlin, Jed B.; Peters, Jessica; Murphy, Sherrie; Van Buren, Nancy L.",Transfusion,602,3

Mortality rates from COVID by age, sex and ethnicity were used to attribute risk to GPs and the Index of Multiple Deprivation was used to determine socioeconomic distributions of the outcomes. Results: Of 45,858 GPs in our sample 3,632 (7.9%) were classified as high risk or very high risk. Of 6,771 GP practices in our sample 639 (9.4%) were identified as single-handed practices and of these 209 (32.7%) were run by a GP at high or very high risk. These 209 single-handed practices care for 710,043 patients. GPs at the highest levels of risk from COVID, and single-handed practices run by high-risk GPs were concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country. London had the highest proportion of both GPs and single-handed GP practices at very high risk of COVID mortality with 1,160 patients per 100,000 population registered to these practices. Conclusions: A significant proportion of GPs working in England, particularly those serving patients in the most deprived neighbourhoods, are at high risk of dying from COVID. Many of these GPs run single-handed practices. These GPs are particularly concentrated in London. There is an opportunity to provide additional support to mitigate COVID risk for GPs, GP practices and their patients. Failure to do so will likely exacerbate existing health inequalities.","Asaria, M.; Fisher, R.",,602,20

In our latest research, a new innovative method of enzyme modification was developed, in which microwave radiation was used as an energy source to process liquid lysozyme concentrate (LLC). After modification, high-quality preparations were obtained. However, long-term storage in a concentrated form initiated various processes that caused darkening over time and could also lead to other significant changes to their structure and, consequently, to their functional properties. This necessitated multidirectional research to explain this phenomenon. This paper presents the results of research aimed at assessing the physicochemical changes in the properties of microwave-modified lysozyme in the form of a liquid concentrate after long-term storage under refrigeration conditions. The assessment also considered the conditions under the acidity of the modifying medium and the duration of the microwave modification. The analysis showed that the values of the basic parameters determining the quality and usefulness of the modified enzyme significantly improved during long-term storage of the preparations. The greatest changes were observed in the preparations modified for the longest time and in the most acidic environment (process time 260 s, pH 2.0), the number of oligomers under these conditions increased by 18% after 12 months of holding, and the surface hydrophobicity increased by as much as 31%. In addition, microbiological tests showed that the preparations of microwave-modified lysozyme had an effect on gram-positive bacteria as well as on gram-negative, and this effect was significantly enhanced after 12 months. The results confirm that LLC modification with microwave radiation is a highly efficient method to prepare high-quality and high utility potential lysozyme. Notably, an interesting and important phenomenon was the observation of the unconventional behaviour of the preparations during their long-term storage, which increased their utility potential significantly.","Leśnierowski, Grzegorz; Yang, Tianyu; Cegielska-Radziejewska, Renata",Sci Rep,602,1

Further we introduce a temporal layer in our modeling by incorporating the stringency level employed by each country over a period of 6 time intervals. Our results show that the indexes and level of stringency are not ideally suited for explaining variation in COVID-19 risk, however the ratio of elderly in the population is a stand out indicator in terms of its predictive power for mortality risk.

Healthcare workers must utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control prevention techniques given the high risk of transmission and potential morbidity associated with COVID-19. We present a case report highlighting the strengths and potential applications of telemedicine technology in a patient’s evaluation during an ongoing emerging, novel infectious disease. CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of fever. His presentation coincided with a recent declaration of a pandemic caused by COVID-19 and a known exposure. Telemedicine evaluation was performed using InTouch Provider(®) software (InTouch Health, Goleta, CA, USA). The treating clinician was able to interact with the patient entirely through observations via web camera. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction testing was ordered and was performed by a dedicated triage nurse. The patient was deemed stable for discharge given his normal vital signs and well appearance. Approximately 72 hours after discharge from the ED, the patient was contacted with positive COVID-19 swab results. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first known case report highlighting use of telemedicine to diagnosis COVID-19 in a patient present in the ED. With the appropriate systems in place, this method of evaluating the patient helped to limit clinician exposure, decrease risk of transmission to key personnel, and assisted with preserving PPE supplies. Use of telemedicine affords multiple benefits in the effective diagnosis, evaluation, and potential prevention of spread of COVID-19.","Mohseni, Michael; Dragon, Marc; Simon, Leslie",Am J Case Rep,602,11

Health care workers (HCW) may be at higher risk of contracting the disease within the working environment and therefore the seroprevalence in this population is of particular interest. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response in Vorarlberg HCW in a prospective cohort study. Methods A total of 395 HCW have been tested at three different time points for the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for NP and RBD. Enrollment started in June 2020 (t1), two months after the end of the first wave. Re-testing took place between October to November at the beginning of the second wave (t2), and again at the end of the second wave in January 2021(t3). Results At t1, 3% of HCW showed a strong IgG-specific responses to either NP or RBD. At t2, the rate increased to 4%, and after the second wave in January 2021, 14% had a strong response, which was assessed to be stable for up to ten months. The amount of HCW with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 38% higher than the number of infections found by PCR. Conclusion We found low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a hotspot setting after the first wave but a massive increase during the second wave distinctly surpassing the number of infected HCW identified by PCR. Our findings, therefore, offer support for the routine application of serological testing in management of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Atzl, M.; Muendlein, A.; Winder, T.; Fraunberger, P.; Brandtner, E.-M.; Geiger, K.; Klausberger, M.; Duerkop, M.; Sprenger, L.; Mutschlechner, B.; volgger, a.; Benda, M.; Severgnini, L.; Jaeger, J.

However, research on this topic has underscored the need to seek greater consensus when considering different conceptual elements that make up this definition. The aim of this study was to develop and validate an instrument for measuring sexting among adolescents, in order to cover a gap identified in the previous literature. The Adolescent Sexting Scale (A-SextS for short) was developed for validation on a sample of 579 Spanish secondary school pupils between the ages of 11 and 18. Evidence for face, content, concurrent, and criterion validity were assessed. A comprehensive set of 64 items, covering six defining characteristics of sexting (e.g., actions, recipient, media format, degree of sexual explicitness), was constructed after conducting an extensive literature review, two discussion groups, and a pilot study. Sexting prevalence rates measured by A-SextS were mostly concurrent with those found in previous studies. A-SextS subscales produced statistically significant positive associations with pornography consumption and physical sexual intercourse. The study shows that A-SextS can be an integrating instrument that facilitates a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of adolescent sexting experiences, as well as the formulation of an operationalized definition of the practice of sexting.","Molla Esparza, Cristian; Nájera, Pablo; López-González, Emelina; Losilla, Josep-Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,602,20

This study was conducted to design and perform psychometric evaluation of self-assessment adolescent physical literacy questionnaire in the Iranian sample. METHODS: A mixed research method, including 3 phases, was used on 836 adolescents in the age range of 12–18 years old. A questionnaire with 59 items was designed based on the qualitative stage, refined during the validity and reliability stages, and finally, formed a questionnaire with 25 items. RESULTS: The exploratory factor analysis showed 3 factors with an explanation of 59.5% of the total variance, and the results of confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the 3-factor model. Results also showed good internal consistency (α = 0.951), retest reliability (0.981–0.837), and concurrent validity of the questionnaire with the PPLI instrument (0.680–0.790).

Clinically, three stages have been identified based on viral infection, pulmonary involvement with inflammation, and fibrosis. Moreover, low and high elastance phenotypes can be distinguished in mechanically ventilated patients, based on lung mechanics, ventilation-to-perfusion ratio, and CT scans; these two phenotypes have presumed differences in their underlying pathophysiology. Although essential for therapeutic guidance, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is poorly understood. Here, we systematically reviewed published case reports and case series in order to increase our understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology by constructing a timeline and correlating histopathological findings with clinical stages of COVID-19. Using PRISMA-IPD guidelines, 42 articles reporting 198 individual cases were included in our analysis. In lung samples (n = 131 cases), we identified three main histological patterns: epithelial (n = 110, 85%), with reactive epithelial changes and DAD; vascular (n = 76, 59%) with microvascular damage, (micro)thrombi, and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia; and fibrotic (n = 28, 22%) with interstitial fibrosis. The epithelial and vascular patterns can present in all stages of symptomatic COVID-19, whereas the fibrotic pattern presents starting at ~3 weeks. Moreover, patients can present with more than one pattern, either simultaneously or consecutively. These findings are consistent with knowledge regarding clinical patterns of viral infection, development of hyperinflammation and hypercoagulability, and fibrosis. Close collaboration among medical staff is necessary in order to translate this knowledge and classification of pathophysiological mechanisms into clinical stages of disease in individual patients. Moreover, further research, including histopathological studies, is warranted in order to develop reliable, clinically relevant biomarkers by correlating these pathological findings with laboratory results and radiological findings, thus, increasing our understanding of COVID-19 and facilitating the move to precision medicine for treating patients.","Polak, Samuel B.; Van Gool, Inge C.; Cohen, Danielle; von der Thüsen, Jan H.; van Paassen, Judith",Mod Pathol,602,4

Despite a number of national and local preventive strategies, childhood caries remains most prevalent among the lower socioeconomic groups and ethnic minorities, especially in northern England. Often overlooked is the social and emotional impact of caries and dental treatment on the children and their families. More long-lasting can be the emotional, psychological and developmental impact on children of dental treatment and extractions under general anaesthesia, especially in unfamiliar hospital settings. Yet, the number of hospital admissions for the 5-9-year-old age group continues to rise and was 26,000 in England in 2018.

PARTICIPANTS: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. RESULTS: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2%) and non-Hispanic Black/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2% NHW and 37.4% NHAA; 44.8% hospitalized, 20.6% admitted to ICU, and 3.8% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization. Pre-existing kidney disease led to 2.55 times higher risk of hospitalization (95% CI, 1.62-4.02; P<.001) in the overall population and 11.9 times higher mortality risk in NHAA (95% CI, 2.2-64.7, P=.004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pre-existing type II diabetes/kidney diseases and living in high population density areas were associated with high risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor prognosis. Association of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race. NHAA patients were disproportionately affected by obesity and kidney disease.","Gu, Tian; Mack, Jasmine A.; Salvatore, Maxwell; Sankar, Swaraaj Prabhu; Valley, Thomas S.; Singh, Karandeep; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K.; Kheterpal, Sachin; Lisabeth, Lynda; Fritsche, Lars G.; Mukherjee, Bhramar",medRxiv,602,16

This study was conducted to investigate the operation and necessary resources of a community treatment center (CTC) operated in Seoul, a metropolitan city with a population of 10 million. METHODS: To respond COVID-19 epidemic, the SMG designated 5 municipal hospitals as dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and implemented one CTC cooperated with the Boramae Municipal Hospital for COVID-19 patients in Seoul. As a retrospective cross-sectional observational study, retrospective medical records review was conducted for patients admitted to the Seoul CTC. The admission and discharge route of CTC patients were investigated. The patient characteristics were compared according to route of discharge whether the patient was discharged to home or transferred to hospital. To report the operation of CTC, the daily mean number of tests (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and chest X-ray) and consultations by medical staffs were calculated per week. The list of frequent used medications and who used medication most frequently were investigated. RESULTS: Until May 27 when the Seoul CTC was closed, 26.5% (n = 213) of total 803 COVID-19 patients in Seoul were admitted to the CTC. It was 35.7% (n = 213) of 597 newly diagnosed patients in Seoul during the 11 weeks of operation. The median length of stay was 21 days (interquartile range, 12–29 days). A total of 191 patients (89.7%) were discharged to home after virologic remission and 22 (10.3%) were transferred to hospital for further treatment. Fifty percent of transferred patients were within a week since CTC admission. Daily 2.5–3.6 consultations by doctors or nurses and 0.4–0.9 tests were provided to one patient. The most frequently prescribed medication was symptomatic medication for COVID-19 (cough/sputum and rhinorrhea). The next ranking was psychiatric medication for sleep problem and depression/anxiety, which was prescribed more than digestive drug. CONCLUSION: In the time of an infectious disease disaster, a metropolitan city can operate a temporary patient facility such as CTC to make a surge capacity and appropriately allocate scarce medical resource.","Lee, Sun Young; Song, Kyoung Jun; Lim, Chun Soo; Kim, Byeong Gwan; Chai, Young Jun; Lee, Jung-Kyu; Kim, Su Hwan; Lim, Hyouk Jae",J Korean Med Sci,602,28

Currently, it emerges as a rapid avenue to alleviate the COVID-19 pandemic disease. (2) Methods: Herein, we tested the antiviral activity of anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, commonly prescribed to relieve respiratory symptoms, against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the viral causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. (3) Results: Of these FDA-approved antimicrobial drugs, Azithromycin, Niclosamide, and Nitazoxanide showed a promising ability to hinder the replication of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate, with IC(50) of 0.32, 0.16, and 1.29 µM, respectively. We provided evidence that several antihistamine and anti-inflammatory drugs could partially reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Furthermore, this study showed that Azithromycin can selectively impair SARS-CoV-2 replication, but not the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A virtual screening study illustrated that Azithromycin, Niclosamide, and Nitazoxanide bind to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Protein data bank (PDB) ID: 6lu7) in binding mode similar to the reported co-crystalized ligand. Also, Niclosamide displayed hydrogen bond (HB) interaction with the key peptide moiety GLN: 493A of the spike glycoprotein active site. (4) Conclusions: The results suggest that Piroxicam should be prescribed in combination with Azithromycin for COVID-19 patients.","Mostafa, Ahmed; Kandeil, Ahmed; A. M. M.

Subsequently, emergency medical services (EMS) have anecdotally experienced fluctuations in demand, with reports across Canada of both increased and decreased demand. Our primary objective was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on call volumes for several determinants in Niagara Region EMS. Our secondary objective was to assess changes in paramedic-assigned patient acuity scores as determined using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). METHODS: We analyzed data from a regional EMS database related to call type, volume, and patient acuity for January to May 2016–2020. We used statistical methods to assess differences in EMS calls between 2016 and 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 114,507 EMS calls were made for the period of January 1 to May 26 between 2016 and 2020, inclusive. Overall, the incidence rate of EMS calls significantly decreased in 2020 compared to the total EMS calls in 2016–2019. Motor vehicle collisions decreased in 2020 relative to 2016–2019 (17%), while overdoses relatively increased (70%) in 2020 compared to 2016–2019. Calls for patients assigned a higher acuity score increased (CTAS 1) (4.1% vs. 2.9%). CONCLUSION: We confirmed that overall, EMS calls have decreased since the emergence of COVID-19. However, this effect on call volume was not consistent across all call determinants, as some call types rose while others decreased. These findings indicate that COVID-19 may have led to actual changes in emergency medical service demand and will be of interest to other services planning for future pandemics or further waves of COVID-19.","Ferron, Richard; Agarwal, Gina; Cooper, Rhiannon; Munkley, Douglas",BMC Emerg Med,602,9

Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) represents the gold standard for diagnostic assays even if it cannot precisely quantify viral RNA copies. Thus, we decided to compare qRT-PCR with digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR), which is able to give an accurate number of RNA copies that can be found in a specimen. However, the aforementioned methods are not capable to discriminate if the detected RNA is infectious or not. For this purpose, it is necessary to perform an endpoint titration on cell cultures, which is largely used in the research field and provides a tissue culture infecting dose per mL (TCID50/mL) value. Both research and diagnostics call for a model that allows the comparison between the results obtained employing different analytical methods. The aim of this study is to define a comparison among two qRT-PCR protocols (one with preliminary RNA extraction and purification and an extraction-free qRT-PCR), a dPCR and a titration on cell cultures. The resulting correlations yield a faithful estimation of the total number of RNA copies and of the infectious viral burden from a Ct value obtained with diagnostic routine tests. All these estimations take into consideration methodological errors linked to the qRT-PCR, dPCR and titration assays.","Brandolini, Martina; Taddei, Francesca; Marino, Maria Michela; Grumiro, Laura; Scalcione, Agata; Turba, Maria Elena; Gentilini, Fabio; Fantini, Michela; Zannoli, Silvia; Dirani, Giorgio; Sambri, Vittorio",Viruses,602,24

Reliable detection of antibodies to specific pathogens in bats is thus epidemiologically critical. Eight variable flying foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) were immunized with 2,4-dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA). Each bat received monthly inoculations for 2 months. Affinity-purified IgG was used for production of polyclonal and monoclonal anti-variable flying fox IgG antibodies. ELISA and western blot analysis were used to monitor immune responses and for assessment of polyclonal and monoclonal antibody species cross-reactivity. Protein G, polyclonal antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies detected specific anti-DNP antibody responses in immunized variable flying foxes, with protein G being the most sensitive, followed by monoclonal antibodies and then polyclonal antibodies. While the polyclonal antibody was found to cross-react well against IgG of all bat species tested, some non-specific background was observed. The monoclonal antibody was found to cross-react well against IgG of six other species in the genus Pteropus and to cross-react less strongly against IgG from Eidolon helvum or Phyllostomus hastatus. Protein G distinguished best between vaccinated and unvaccinated bats, and these results validate the use of protein G for detection of bat IgG. Monoclonal antibodies developed in this study recognized immunoglobulins from other members of the genus Pteropus well, and may be useful in applications where specific detection of Pteropus IgG is needed.","Wellehan Jr., James F.X.; Green, Linda G.; Duke, Diane G.; Bootorabi, Shadi; Heard, Darryl J.; Klein, Paul A.; Jacobson, Elliott R.","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",602,1

SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system, and the most common symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, and fever. However, its impact on the digestive system has been shown, and various clinical gastrointestinal manifestations of this disease have been recognized. Some reports have shown acute pancreatitis (AP) as the initial symptom in patients with COVID-19. AP may be a consequence of direct pancreatic damage by the virus because pancreatic acinar cells contain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor proteins, and SARS-CoV-2 can bind to these receptors, causing pancreatic injury. Moreover, AP may be a secondary indicator of cytokine storms and altered inflammatory responses. Our review of the literature shows that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a new etiological infectious factor related to AP. In this manuscript, a comprehensive review of case reports and case series of patients with AP and COVID-19 is presented. All reports on COVID-19-associated AP are summarized. All cases are thoroughly analyzed and discussed in-depth.","Jabłońska, Beata; Olakowski, Marek; Mrowiec, Sławomir",World J Gastrointest Surg,602,26

In this retrospective cohort study, we included all consecutive patients aged 75 years and older who were hospitalized for acute respiratory failure (ARF) in either an acute geriatric unit or an acute pulmonary care unit, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We compared the in-hospital prognosis between patients treated with HFNCO and patients treated with HCM. To account for confounders, we created a propensity score for HFNCO, and stabilizing inverse probability of treatment weighting (SIPTW) was applied. From March 2020 to January 2021, 67 patients (median age 87 years, 41 men) were hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2-related ARF, of whom 41 (61%) received HFNCO and 26 (39%) did not. Age and comorbidities did not significantly differ in the two groups, whereas clinical presentation was more severe in the HFNCO group (NEW2 score: 8 (5–11) vs. 7 (5–8), p = 0.02, and Sp02/Fi02: 88 (98–120) vs. 117 (114–148), p = 0.03). Seven (17%) vs. two (5%) patients survived at 30 days in the HFNCO and HCM group, respectively. Overall, after SIPTW, HFNCO was significantly associated with greater survival (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.33–0.99; p = 0.04). HFNCO use was associated with a lower need for morphine (AHR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21–0.71; p = 0.005), but not for midazolam (AHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.37–1.19; p = 0.17).

To investigate the discrepancy in state-wise CFRs, datasets on various factors related to demography, socio-economy, public health, and healthcare capacity have been collected to study their association with CFR. METHODS: State-wise COVID-19 data was collected till April 22, 2021. The latest data on the various factors have been collected from reliable sources. Pearson correlation, two-tailed P test, Spearman rank correlation, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures have been used to assess the association between various factors and CFR. RESULTS: Life expectancies, prevalence of overweight, COVID-19 test positive rates, and H1N1 fatality rates show a significant positive association with CFR. Human Development Index, per capita GDP, public affairs index, health expenditure per capita, availability of govt. doctors & hospital beds, prevalence of certain diseases, and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension show insignificant association with CFR. Sex ratio, health expenditure as a percent of GSDP, and availability of govt. hospitals show a significant negative correlation with CFR. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that older people, males of younger age groups, and overweight people are at more fatality risk from COVID-19. Certain diseases and common comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension do not seem to have any significant effect on CFR. States with better COVID-19 testing rates, health expenditure, and healthcare capacity seem to perform better with regard to COVID-19 fatality rates.","Upadhyay, Ashwini Kumar; Shukla, Shreyanshi",Diabetes Metab Syndr,602,23

There are a number of distinct groups of Golgi membrane proteins, including glycosyltransferases, recycling trans-Golgi network (TGN) proteins, peripheral membrane proteins and receptors. Considerable effort has been directed at understanding the basis of the localisation of Golgi glycosyltransferases and recycling TGN proteins; in both cases there is increasing evidence that multiple signals may be involved in their specific localisation. A number of models for the Golgi retention of glycosyltransferases have been proposed including oligomerisation, lipid-mediated sorting and intra-Golgi retrograde transport. More information is required to determine the contribution of each of these potential mechanisms in the targeting of different glycosyltransferases.

Moreover, such information is crucial to decrease the risk that HCWs and health care facilities become amplifiers for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of different health care professional categories and operational units, including in-hospital wards, outpatient facilities, and territorial care departments, with seroprevalence and odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using IgG serological tests collected from April 1 through May 26, 2020, in the Lombardy region in Italy. Voluntary serological screening was offered to all clinical and nonclinical staff providing any health care services or support to health care services in the region. Data were analyzed from June 2020 through April 2021. EXPOSURES: Employment in the health care sector. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seroprevalence of positive IgG antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 was collected, and odds ratios of experiencing infection were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 140 782 professionals employed in the health sector were invited to participate in IgG serological screening, among whom 82 961 individuals (59.0% response rate) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, with median (interquartile range [IQR]; range) age, 50 (40-56; 19-83) years and 59 839 (72.1%) women. Among these individuals, 10 115 HCWs (12.2%; 95% CI, 12.0%-12.4%) had positive results (median [IQR; range] age, 50 [39-55; 20-80] years; 7298 [72.2%] women). Statistically significantly higher odds of infection were found among health assistants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.65) and nurses (aOR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17-1.41) compared with administrative staff and among workers employed in internal medicine (aOR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.87-2.68), palliative care (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.38-2.44), rehabilitation (aOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.91), and emergency departments (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.29-1.89) compared with those working as telephone operators. Statistically significantly lower odds of infection were found among individuals working in forensic medicine (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.88), histology and anatomical pathology (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.97), and medical device sterilization (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.84) compared with those working as telephone operators. The odds of infection for physicians and laboratory personnel were not statistically significantly different from those found among administrative staff. The odds of infection for workers employed in intensive care units and infectious disease wards were not statistically significantly different from those of telephone operators. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that professionals partially accustomed to managing infectious diseases had higher odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings further suggest that adequate organization of clinical wards and personnel, appropriate personal protective equipment supply, and training of all workers directly and repeatedly exposed to patients with clinical or subclinical COVID-19 should be prioritized to decrease the risk of infection in health care settings.","Poletti, Piero; Tirani, Marcello; Cereda, Danilo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Trentini, Filippo; Marziano, Valentina; Toso, Claudia; Piatti, Alessandra; Piccarreta, Raffaella; Melegaro, Alessia; Andreassi, Aida; Gramegna, Maria; Ajelli, Marco; Merler, Stefano",JAMA Netw Open,602,20

This review is intended to provide a broad view of how nutrient inputs—from fertilizer and CAFOs—as well as atmospheric NH(3) and greenhouse gas emissions, are changing regionally within the US and how these changes compare with nutrient inputs from human wastewater. Use of commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizer in the US, which now exceeds 12,000,000 metric tonnes (MT) continues to increase, at a rate of 60,000 MT per year, while that of phosphorus (P) has remained nearly constant over the past decade at around 1,800,000 MT. The number of CAFOs in the US has increased nearly 10% since 2012, driven largely by a near 13% increase in hog production. The annualized inventory of cattle, dairy cows, hogs, broiler chickens and turkeys is approximately 8.7 billion, but CAFOs are highly regionally concentrated by animal sector. Country-wide, N applied by fertilizer is about threefold greater than manure N inputs, but for P these inputs are more comparable. Total manure inputs now exceed 4,000,000 MT as N and 1,400,000 MT as P. For both N and P, inputs and proportions vary widely by US region. The waste from hog and dairy operations is mainly held in open lagoons that contribute to NH(3) and greenhouse gas (as CH(4) and N(2)O) emissions. Emissions of NH(3) from animal waste in 2019 were estimated at > 4,500,000 MT. Emissions of CH(4) from manure management increased 66% from 1990 to 2017 (that from dairy increased 134%, cattle 9.6%, hogs 29% and poultry 3%), while those of N(2)O increased 34% over the same time period (dairy 15%, cattle 46%, hogs 58%, and poultry 14%). Waste from CAFOs contribute substantially to nutrient pollution when spread on fields, often at higher N and P application rates than those of commercial fertilizer. Managing the runoff associated with fertilizer use has improved with best management practices, but reducing the growing waste from CAFO operations is essential if eutrophication and its effects on fresh and marine waters–namely hypoxia and harmful algal blooms (HABs)—are to be reduced.

Statins are effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which has long been a target for treatment decisions. We discuss the weakening dependence between cholesterol levels and mortality as a function of age and highlight recent findings on lipoprotein subfractions and other superior markers of ASCVD risk. The efficacy of statins is compared for distinct subsets of patients based on age, diabetes, ASCVD, and coronary artery calcium (CAC) status. Most cardiovascular risk calculators heavily weight age and overestimate one’s absolute risk of ASCVD, particularly in very old adults. Improvements in risk assessment enable the identification of specific patient populations that benefit most from statin treatment. Derisking is particularly important for adults over 75, in whom treatment benefits are reduced and adverse musculoskeletal effects are amplified. The CAC score stratifies the benefit effect size obtainable with statins, and forms of coenzyme Q are discussed for improving patient outcomes. Robust risk estimator tools and personalized, evidence-based approaches are needed to optimally reduce cardiovascular events and mortality rates through administration of cholesterol-lowering medications.","White, Alyssa M.

As of March 13, 2021, more than 118.9 million cases were infected with COVID-19 worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA beta-CoV. Most COVID-19 infected individuals recover within 1–3 weeks. Nevertheless, approximately 5% of patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and other systemic complications, leading to death. Structural genetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have shown genomic resemblances but a low evolutionary correlation to SARS-CoV-1 responsible for the 2002–2004 outbreak. The S glycoprotein is critical for cell adhesion and the entrance of the virus into the host. The process of cell entry uses the cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Recent evidence proposed that the CD147 as a SARS-CoV-2′s potential receptor. The viral genome is mainly held by two non-structural proteins (NSPs), ORF1a and ORF1ab, along with structural proteins. Although NSPs are conserved among the βCoVs, mutations in NSP2 and NSP3 may play critical roles in transmitting the virus and cell tropism. To date, no specific/targeted anti-viral treatments exist. Notably, more than 50 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in clinical trials, and a few being administered. Preventive precautions are the primary strategy to limit the viral load transmission and spread, emphasizing the urgent need for developing significant drug targets and vaccines against COVID-19.

We hypothesized that Latinx patients would be more likely to be hospitalized and admitted to the ICU than White patients. METHODS: We analyzed all patients with COVID-19 in 12 Massachusetts hospitals between February 1 and April 14, 2020. We examined the association between race, ethnicity, age, reported comorbidities, and hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Of 5190 COVID-19 patients, 29% were hospitalized; 33% required ICU and 4.3% died. 46% of patients were White, 25% Latinx, 14% African American, and 3% Asian American. Ethnicity and race were significantly associated with hospitalization. More Latinx and African American patients in the younger age groups were hospitalized than whites. Latinx and African Americans disproportionally required ICU, with 39% of hospitalized Latinx patients requiring ICU compared to 33% of African Americans, 24% of Asian Americans, and 30% of Whites (p&0.007). Within each ethnic and racial group, age and male gender were independently predictive of hospitalization. Previously reported pre-existing comorbidities contributed to the need for hospitalization in all racial and ethnic groups (p&0.05). However, the observed disparities were less likely related to reported comorbidities, with Latinx and African American patients being admitted at twice the rate of Whites, regardless of such comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Latinx and African American patients with COVID-19 have higher rates of hospitalization and ICU admission than White patients. The etiologies of such disparities are likely multifactorial and cannot be explained only by reported comorbidities.","Izzy, Saef; Tahir, Zabreen; Cote, David J; Al Jarrah, Ali; Roberts, Matthew Blake; Turbett, Sarah; Kadar, Aran; Smirnakis, Stelios M; Feske, Steven K; Zafonte, Ross; Fishman, Jay A; El Khoury, Joseph",Open Forum Infect Dis,602,20

However, the costs of loneliness are poorly understood. Methods: Multiple sources were combined into a dataset containing a nationally representative sample (n = 341,376) of Dutch adults (18+). The association between loneliness and total, general practitioner (GP), specialized, pharmaceutical, and mental healthcare expenditure was tested using Poisson and Zero-inflated negative binomial models, controlling for numerous potential confounders (i.e., demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle-related factors, self-perceived health, and psychological distress), for four age groups. Results: Controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle-related factors, loneliness was indirectly (via poorer health) associated with higher expenditure in all categories. In fully adjusted models, it showed a direct association with higher expenditure for GP and mental healthcare (0.5 and 11.1%, respectively). The association with mental healthcare expenditure was stronger in younger than in older adults (for ages 19–40, the contribution of loneliness represented 61.8% of the overall association). Conclusion: Loneliness contributes to health expenditure both directly and indirectly, particularly in younger age groups. This implies a strong financial imperative to address this issue.","Meisters, Rachelle; Westra, Daan; Putrik, Polina; Bosma, Hans; Ruwaard, Dirk; Jansen, Maria",Int J Public Health,602,22

This study was conducted to evaluate the distribution of respiratory viruses in patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) through the first teaching hospital-based surveillance scheme for ILI in South Korea. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were obtained from adult patients (≥18 years) who visited the emergency department (ED) with ILI from week 40, 2011 to week 22, 2012. Multiplex PCR was performed to detect respiratory viruses: influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, bocavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: Among 1,983 patients who visited the ED with ILI, 811 (40.9%) were male. The median age of patients was 43 years. Influenza vaccination rate was 21.7% (430/1,983) during the 2011–2012 season. At least one comorbidity was found in 18% of patients. The positive rate of respiratory viruses was 52.1% (1,033/1,983) and the total number of detected viruses was 1,100. Influenza A virus was the dominant agent (677, 61.5%) in all age groups. The prevalence of human metapneumovirus was higher in patients more than 50 years old, while adenovirus was detected only in younger adults. In 58 (5.6%) cases, two or more respiratory viruses were detected. The co-incidence case was identified more frequently in patients with hematologic malignancy or organ transplantation recipients, however it was not related to clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study is valuable as the first extensive laboratory surveillance of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in ILI patients through a teaching hospital-based influenza surveillance system in South Korea.","Noh, Ji Yun; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Choi, Won Suk; Lee, Jacob; Lee, Jin-Soo; Wie, Seong-Heon; Jeong, Hye Won; Kim, Young Keun; Choi, Sung Hyuk; Han, Seung Baik; So, Byung-Hak; Kim, Hyun; Kim, Woo Joo",PLoS One,602,26

This phenomenon is especially obvious on a windless sunny day. The near wall thermal plume can drive gaseous pollutants released from lower floors to upper floors. Combined with the effect of ambient approaching wind, the transmission routes will be very complicated. The paper aims to investigate the airflow patterns and pollutant transmission within a building under the effects of wind and thermal forces. A hypothetical twenty-storey slab-shape high-rise building in Shanghai with single-sided natural ventilation is set as the research object in the present study. The intensity of solar radiation on a typical day during transition season is theoretically analysed. The temperature difference between the heated building envelope and the ambient air is calculated by a simplified heat balance model. Finally, the tracer gas method is employed in the numerical simulation to analyse the influence of the wind and wall thermal plume flow on the inter-flat pollutant transmission characteristics. The results show that, the temperature difference between sunward and shady side wall is about 10 K at noon on the designate day. When the source is set as a point with steady intensity and the buoyancy is stronger than or approximately equivalent to the wind, the reentry ratio of the flat immediately above the source can be around 25%.","Mu, Di; Gao, Naiping; Zhu, Tong",Build Environ,602,1

If they do not select a primary care provider, they are auto-assigned to one. The impact of auto-assignment has largely been understudied outside the context of patient satisfaction with the insurance plan. The purpose of the study was to explore the association between auto-assignment and flu vaccination use, which will contribute to our understanding of factors influencing the COVID-19 vaccine uptake. METHODS: Retrospective data from the Enterprise Data Warehouse of a health system were obtained for adult Medicaid enrolees assigned to a Midwestern health system in 2019. Descriptive statistics, independent t-tests and tetrachoric correlations were used to explore the relationship between auto-assignment and flu vaccine receipt among a large sample of Illinois residents (N = 7224). The sample was then divided into those who chose their provider (n = 6027) and those who were auto-assigned (n = 1197). KEY FINDINGS: Individuals who selected their provider were deemed to have flu vaccine coverage over those who were auto-assigned (33.2% vs. 6.6%). Furthermore, among those who were auto-assigned, age, number of office visits and having chronic morbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P < 0.01), diabetes (P < 0.01) and heart failure (P < 0.01), were positively associated with flu vaccine receipt. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who are auto-assigned to a primary care provider are less likely to be flu vaccine recipients than those who choose their provider. This suggests that auto-assignment is a risk factor that influences vaccine receipt. This research provides perspectives for outreach efforts that target individuals who are auto-assigned to a provider.","Klein, Colleen J; Dalstrom, Matthew D; Foulger, Roopa; Weinzimmer, Laurence G",J Pharm Health Serv Res,602,29

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate if a brief self-guided, online psychological intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated symptoms. METHODS: 670 adults from the Swedish general population reporting daily uncontrollable worry about CO­VID-19 and its possible consequences (e.g., illness, death, the economy, one's family) were randomised (1:1 ratio) to a 3-week self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry and associated symptoms, or a waiting list of equal duration. The primary outcome measure was a COVID-19 adapted version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale administered at baseline and weeks 1–3 (primary endpoint). Follow-up assessments were conducted 1 month after treatment completion. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04341922) before inclusion of the first participant. RESULTS: The main pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant reductions in COVID-19-related worry for the intervention group compared to the waiting list (β = 1.14, Z = 9.27, p < 0.001), corresponding to a medium effect size (bootstrapped d = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.58–0.90]). Improvements were also seen on all secondary measures, including mood, daily functioning, insomnia, and intolerance of uncertainty. Participant satisfaction was high. No serious adverse events were recorded.

METHODS: We accessed the New York Times GitHub repository COVID19 data and 2018 United States Census data for all United States Counties. The disparate datasets were merged and filtered to allow for visualization and assessments about case fatality rate (CFR%) and associated demographic, ethnic and economic features. RESULTS: Our results suggest that county-level COVID19 fatality rates are related to advanced population age (P < .001) and less diversity as evidenced by higher proportion of Caucasians in High CFR% counties (P < .001). Also, lower CFR% counties had a greater proportion of the population reporting has having 2 or more races (P < .001). We noted no significant differences between High and Low CFR% counties with respect to mean income or poverty rate. CONCLUSIONS: Unique COVID19 impacts are realized at the county level.

We investigated the protective effect of the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca non-replicating viral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; AZD1222) and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) in residents of long-term care facilities in terms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over time since vaccination. METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study that commenced recruitment on June 11, 2020, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection outcomes, and immunity in residents and staff in long-term care facilities in England that provide residential or nursing care for adults aged 65 years and older. In this cohort study, we included long-term care facility residents undergoing routine asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing between Dec 8, 2020 (the date the vaccine was first deployed in a long-term care facility), and March 15, 2021, using national testing data linked within the COVID-19 Datastore. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection at 0–6 days, 7–13 days, 14–20 days, 21–27 days, 28–34 days, 35–48 days, and 49 days and beyond after vaccination, comparing unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time from the same cohort of residents, adjusting for age, sex, previous infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, long-term care facility bed capacity, and clustering by long-term care facility. We also compared mean PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive swabs obtained before and after vaccination. The study is registered with ISRCTN, number 14447421. FINDINGS: 10 412 care home residents aged 65 years and older from 310 LTCFs were included in this analysis. The median participant age was 86 years (IQR 80–91), 7247 (69·6%) of 10 412 residents were female, and 1155 residents (11·1%) had evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9160 (88·0%) residents received at least one vaccine dose, of whom 6138 (67·0%) received ChAdOx1 and 3022 (33·0%) received BNT162b2. Between Dec 8, 2020, and March 15, 2021, there were 36 352 PCR results in 670 628 person-days, and 1335 PCR-positive infections (713 in unvaccinated residents and 612 in vaccinated residents) were included. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days after the first vaccine dose to 0·44 (95% CI 0·24–0·81) at 28–34 days and 0·38 (0·19–0·77) at 35–48 days. Similar effect sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (adjusted HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·15–0·66) and BNT162b2 (0·35, 0·17–0·71) vaccines at 35–48 days. Mean PCR Ct values were higher for infections that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination than for those occurring before vaccination (31·3 [SD 8·7] in 107 PCR-positive tests vs 26·6 [6·6] in 552 PCR-positive tests; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Single-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines provides substantial protection against infection in older adults from 4–7 weeks after vaccination and might reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the risk of infection is not eliminated, highlighting the ongoing need for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission in long-term care facilities.

More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and many cities have already transformed into “smart” digital/virtual hubs. Digital services ensure city life safe without an economy lockout and unemployment. Urban society strives to be safe, sustainable, well-being, and healthy. We set the task to construct a hybrid sociological and technological concept of a smart city with matched solutions, complementary to each other. Our modeling with the elaborated digital architectures and with the bionic solution for ensuring sufficient data governance showed that a smart city in comparison with the traditional city is tightly interconnected inside like a social “organism”. Society has entered a decisive decade during which the world will change by moving closer towards SDGs targets 2030 as well as by the transformation of cities and their digital infrastructures. It is important to recognize the large vector of sociological transformation as smart cities are just a transition phase to human-centered personal space or smart home. The “atomization” of the world urban population raises the gap problem in achieving SDGs because of different approaches to constructing digital architectures for smart cities or smart homes in countries. The strategy of creating smart cities should bring each citizen closer to SDGs at the individual level, laying in the personal space the principles of sustainable development and wellness of personality.

None of these patients had a history of lung disease and one patient was a previous smoker. One out of three patients died. Inflammatory markers were noted to be elevated in each of these patients to levels that have been associated with severe COVID-19 infection. CT scans in these patients showed bilateral air space disease consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax with other features including pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumatoceles. This may indicate the underlying pathogenesis of pneumothorax in these patients to involve inflammation-induced pulmonary parenchymal injury and necrosis with subsequent development of air leaks into the pleural cavity, a mechanism similar to that noted in patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Conservative management with chest tube drainage or observation was adequate for two of three patients while one patient developed multi-organ system dysfunction and eventual death.","Mallick, Taha; Dinesh, Anant; Engdahl, Ryan; Sabado, Mario",Cureus,602,9

The COVID-19 virus spread rapidly all over the world. Scientists strive to find virus-specific antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. The present study reports a molecular docking study of the stilbenolignans and SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) inhibitors. The detailed interactions between the stilbenolignan analogues and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors were determined as hydrophobic bonds, hydrogen bonds and electronic bonds, inhibition activity, ligand efficiency, bonding type and distance and etc. The binding energies of the stilbenolignan analogues were obtained from the molecular docking of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Lehmbachol D, Maackolin, Gnetucleistol, Gnetifolin F, Gnetofuran A and Aiphanol were found to be −7.7, −8.2, −7.3, −8.5, −8.0 and −7.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Osirus, Molinspiration and SwissADME chemoinformatic tools were used to examine ADMET properties, pharmacokinetic parameters and toxicological characteristics of the stilbenolignan analogues. All analogues obey the Lipinski’s rule of five. Furthermore, stilbenolignan analogues were studied to predict their binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using molecular modeling and simulation techniques, and the binding free energy calculations of all complexes were calculated using the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method. With the data presented here it has been observed that these analogues may be a good candidate for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in vivo studies, so more research can be done on stilbenolignan analogues.","Cetin, Adnan",Chem Phys Lett,602,16

Together, each country has modern drugs and a variety of medicinal products developed from their traditional medical practitioners to treat a common cold. In this review, we describe potentially synergistic therapeutics of traditional and complementary medicine available for common cold which might be useful for prevention or for the adjuvant treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Further, we provide a phylogenetic overview of SARSCoV-2 based on a complete genome sequence of common cold viruses. We suggest modern and traditional medicine and preventive strategies which might control the disease to offer more suitable and acceptable common cold management including coronavirus. A substantial proportion of medicinal products developed by traditional medicine against common cold as well as modern medicine mainly focus on symptoms suppression. The recombinant interferon alpha-2b and lactoferrin derived from modern medicine in combination with herbal based products from traditional medicine may support the prevention of novel coronavirus infections. An integrated approach against common cold viruses to establish efficacy and safety through modern and traditional medicine and regular physical exercise along with preventive dietary sources is proposed.","Anbalagan, Sankarappan; Arunprasanna, Vimalanathan; Dinakaran, Sundaram; Krishnan, Muthukalingan",Synergy,602,26

A concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, we isolated NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or a history of SARS-CoV infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies demonstrated function-specific modes of binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated Fc receptor-γ (FcγR)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated FcγR-independent in vitro infection enhancement. However, both types of infection-enhancing antibodies protected from SARS-CoV-2 replication in monkeys and mice. Three of 46 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had higher lung inflammation scores compared to controls. One monkey had alveolar edema and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cytokines. Thus, while in vitro antibody-enhanced infection does not necessarily herald enhanced infection in vivo, increased lung inflammation can rarely occur in SARS-CoV-2 antibody-infused macaques.","Li, Dapeng; Edwards, Robert J.; Manne, Kartik; Martinez, David R.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Alam, S.

The strengthening of the diagnostic infrastructure reappears as an opportunity for the national reference laboratories. Sharing of epidemiological information for the modeling of epidemiological scenarios allows collaboration between health, academic and scientific institutions. The fear of contagion by COVID-19 is constraining people with arboviral diseases to search for care which can lead to an increase in serious cases and could disrupt the operation of vector-control programs due to the reluctance of residents to open their doors to health personnel. Promoting intense community participation along with the incorporation of long lasting innovations in vector control offers new opportunities for control.

To further explore this area, we developed a novel palpation device consisting of a uniquely designed nodule mechanism (based on optimizing nodule top and bottom hemisphere wall thickness and manipulating granular jamming method) that can vary stiffness while maintaining the shape of the same nodule display, for which current devices are not capable of in terms of aping a tumor. Methods: This paper evaluates the manufacturing approach of the nodule, exploring several iterations of the nodule prototype. Experiments were performed on nodule prototypes of varying wall thicknesses in order to evaluate its effect on stiffness and deformation. Results and Conclusions: Experimental results showed that nodule top and bottom wall thickness had a significant effect on the stiffness and deformation of the nodule. The higher the thickness of the top hemisphere and the lower the thickness of the bottom hemisphere, the greater the stiffness the nodule can achieve. Similarly, the display shape of the nodule can be maintained with minimal or no deformation if the nodule top hemisphere thickness is optimally higher than bottom hemisphere thickness.","Sikander, Sakura; Biswas, Pradipta; Song, Sang-Eun",Micromachines (Basel),602,0

In spite of that, there are still massive challenges that have not been resolved. Although the incidence of tuberculosis has decreased in the developed world, it is still a significant public health problem in the rest of the world. There are still over 2 million deaths annually from tuberculosis, with most of these occurring in the developing world. Even with the development of new pharmaceuticals to treat tuberculosis, there is no indication that the disease will be eradicated. Respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pertussis are other respiratory infectious diseases with special problems of their own, from vaccine development to vaccine coverage.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the implications of delays in transplantation among Canadian end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients to allow pretransplant vaccination. DESIGN: We used a Markov microsimulation model and ESKD patient perspective to study the effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years [QALY]) of living (LD) or deceased donor (DD) kidney transplantation followed by 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine versus delay in LD (“Delay LD”) or refusal of DD offer (“Delay DD”) to receive 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine pretransplant. SETTING: Canadian dialysis and transplant centers. PATIENTS: We simulated a 10 000-waitlisted ESKD patient cohort, which was predictively modeled for a lifetime horizon in monthly cycles. MEASUREMENTS: Inputs on patient and graft survival estimates by patient, LD or DD characteristics, were extracted from the Treatment of End-Stage Organ Failure in Canada, Canadian Organ Replacement Register, 2009 to 2018. In addition, a literature review provided inputs on quality of life, SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, new variants of concern, mortality risk, and antibody responses to 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. METHODS: We conducted base case, scenario, and sensitivity analyses to illustrate the impact of patient, donor, vaccine, and pandemic characteristics on the preferred strategy. RESULTS: In the average waitlisted Canadian patient, receiving 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine post-transplant provided an effectiveness of 22.32 (95% confidence interval: 22.00-22.7) for LD and 19.34 (19.02-19.67) QALYs for DD. Delaying transplants for 6 months to allow 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine before LD and DD transplant yielded effectiveness of 22.83 (21.51-23.14) and 20.65 (20.33-20.96) QALYs, respectively. Scenario analysis suggested a benefit to short delays in DD transplants to receive 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in waitlisted patients ≥55 years. Two-way sensitivity analysis suggested decreased effectiveness of the strategy prioritizing 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine prior to DD transplant the longer the delay and the higher the Kidney Donor Risk Index of the eventual DD transplant. When assessing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (infection rates ≥10-fold and associated mortality ≥3-fold vs base case), we found short delays to allow 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration pretransplant to be preferable. LIMITATIONS: Risks associated with nosocomial exposure of LDs were not considered. There was uncertainty regarding input parameters related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, new variants, and COVID-19 severity in ESKD patients. Given rollout of population-level SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we assumed a linear decrease in infection rates over 1 year. Proportions of patients mounting an antibody response to 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were considered in lieu of data on vaccine efficacy in dialysis and following transplantation. Non-age-stratified annual mortality rates were used for waitlisted candidates. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that short delays allowing pretransplant vaccination offered comparable to greater effectiveness than pursuing transplantation without delay, proposing transplant candidates should be prioritized to receive at least 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Our scenario and sensitivity analyses suggest that caution must be exercised when declining DD offers in patients offered low risk DD and who are likely to incur significant delays in access to transplantation. While population-level herd immunity may decrease infection risk in transplant patients, more data are required on vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern in ESKD, and how efficacy may be modified by a third vaccine dose, maintenance immunosuppression and timing of induction and rejection therapies.","Yanev, Ivan; Gagnon, Michael; Cheng, Matthew P.; Paraskevas, Steven; Kumar, Deepali; Dragomir, Alice; Sapir-Pichhadze, Ruth",Can J Kidney Health Dis,602,16

To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness. Novel treatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients. In light of this, there has been growing interest in the use of existing medications, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments of this disease. AIM: To establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of CQ and HCQ in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted on 21 March 2020. A further search was conducted in Google for relevant literature on 28 March 2020. RESULTS: There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2. A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway. The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results. Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (n = 30 and n = 36) and suffer methodological limitations. No medium or long-term follow-up data is available. CONCLUSION: At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19. High quality, adequately powered randomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians. These studies should report medium- and long-term follow-up results, and safety data.","Gbinigie, Kome; Frie, Kerstin",BJGP open,602,1

Though guidelines are available to optimize syncope care, research indicates that current clinical guidelines have not significantly impacted resource utilization surrounding emergency department (ED) evaluation of syncope. Matching implementation strategies to barriers and facilitators and tailoring strategies to local context hold significant promise for a successful implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Our team applied implementation science principles to develop a stakeholder-based implementation strategy. Methods and Materials: We partnered with patients, family caregivers, frontline clinicians and staff, and health system administrators at four health systems to conduct quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews for context assessment. The identification of implementation strategies was done by applying the CFIR-ERIC Implementation Strategy Matching Tool and soliciting stakeholders’ inputs. We then co-designed with patients and frontline teams, and developed and tested specific strategies. Results: A total of 114 clinicians completed surveys and 32 clinicians and stakeholders participated in interviews. Results from the surveys and interviews indicated low awareness of syncope guidelines, communication challenges with patients, lack of CPG protocol integration into ED workflows, and organizational process to change as major barriers to CPG implementation. Thirty-one patients and their family caregivers participated in interviews and expressed their expectations: clarity regarding their diagnosis, context surrounding care plan and diagnostic testing, and a desire to feel cared about. Identifying change methods to address the clinician barriers and patients and family caregivers expectations informed development of the multilevel, multicomponent implementation strategy, MISSION, which includes patient educational materials, mentored implementation, academic detailing, Syncope Optimal Care Pathway and a corresponding mobile app, and Lean quality improvement methods. The pilot of MISSION demonstrated feasibility, acceptability and initial success on appropriate testing. Conclusions: Effective multifaceted implementation strategies that target individuals, teams, and healthcare systems can be employed to plan successful implementation and promote adherence to syncope CPGs.","Li, Jing; Smyth, Susan S.; Clouser, Jessica M.; McMullen, Colleen A.; Gupta, Vedant; Williams, Mark V.",Medicina (Kaunas),602,16

HA with a monobasic motif is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases, including TMPRSS2 and HAT, while the multibasic motif found in high pathogenicity avian influenza HA is cleaved by furin, PC5/6, or MSPL. MSPL belongs to the TMPRSS family and preferentially cleaves [R/K]-K-K-R↓ sequences. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular region of human MSPL in complex with an irreversible substrate-analog inhibitor. The structure revealed three domains clustered around the C-terminal α-helix of the SPD. The inhibitor structure and its putative model show that the P1-Arg inserts into the S1 pocket, whereas the P2-Lys and P4-Arg interacts with the Asp/Glu-rich 99-loop that is unique to MSPL. Based on the structure of MSPL, we also constructed a homology model of TMPRSS2, which is essential for the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and infection.

Knowledge of the direct medical costs of COVID-19 treatments is limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine the characteristics of older adults with COVID-19 and their costs for COVID-19–related medical care. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Medical claims for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries. PATIENTS: Medicare FFS beneficiaries aged 65 years or older who had a COVID-19–related medical encounter during April through December 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Patient characteristics and direct medical costs of COVID-19–related hospitalizations and outpatient visits. RESULTS: Among 28.1 million Medicare FFS beneficiaries, 1 181 127 (4.2%) sought COVID-19–related medical care. Among these patients, 23.0% had an inpatient stay and 4.2% died during hospitalization. The majority of the patients were female (57.0%), non-Hispanic White (79.6%), and residents of an urban county (77.2%). Medicare FFS costs for COVID-19–related medical care were $6.3 billion; 92.6% of costs were for hospitalizations. The mean hospitalization cost was $21 752, and the mean length of stay was 9.2 days; hospitalization cost and length of stay were higher if the patient needed a ventilator ($49 441 and 17.1 days) or died ($32 015 and 11.3 days). The mean cost per outpatient visit was $164. Patients aged 75 years or older were more likely to be hospitalized, but their hospitalizations were associated with lower costs than for younger patients. Male sex and non-White race/ethnicity were associated with higher probability of being hospitalized and higher medical costs. LIMITATION: Results are based on Medicare FFS patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in substantial disease and economic burden among older Americans, particularly those of non-White race/ethnicity.

CRP is an educational framework that asserts that successful teachers of African American students help their students gain three repertoires: (1) sociopolitical awareness, (2) cultural competence, and (3) academic excellence. The CRP framework was designed to counter the effects that racial bias has on the academic and disciplinary experiences of some students of color. This article suggests that applied behavior analysis and CRP, when used together, may strengthen educators’ efforts to reduce the effects of racism that some students of color experience. The authors first explain the tenets of CRP based on the work of Ladson-Billings (1995a, 1995b). Next, points of convergence between ABA and CRP are described. Finally, the authors offer recommendations for behavior analysts to consider when applying CRP in schools through the provision of examples of strategies and tactics derived from the behavioral literature that align with the CRP framework. The framework presented in this article has implications for behavior analysts interested in applying culturally relevant practices to their work as educators.","Hugh-Pennie, Amoy K.; Hernandez, Mya; Uwayo, Margaret; Johnson, Gaige; Ross, Denise",Behav Anal Pract,602,24

In this paper, we propose and test a methodology to estimate the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) through the lens of the Kalman Filter and Bayesian estimation. Moreover, we apply our method to data from the current COVID-19 pandemic in China, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. We correlate our findings with the implementation of control measures in each of these countries. Our results show that China, Italy, and South Korea have been able to reduce Rt over time. We find significant heterogeneity in the way Rt decreases across countries. For instance, China reduced Rt from its peak to below one in 19 days, while South Korea achieved the same reduction in 12 days. In contrast, it has taken Italy almost a month to reach similar levels. We hypothesize this is related to how strict, enforceable, and comprehensive are the implemented policies.","Rondon-Moreno, Carlos; Arroyo Marioli, Francisco; Bullano, Francisco",,602,1

OBJECTIVE: To present the SCE group, its functioning, and the main support it provided for frontline HCWs. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of heads of infectious disease departments from reference hospitals was created to build a network of clinical expertise for care, training, and research in the field of epidemic and biological risk (EBR). The network developed a set of standardized operational procedures (SOPs) to guide interventions to manage EBR-suspect patients. RESULTS: A working group created the SOP aimed at frontline HCWs taking care of patients. Priority was given to the development of a generic procedure, which was then adapted according to the current alert. Five key steps were identified and hierarchized: detecting, protecting, caring for, alerting, and referring the EBR patient. The interaction between clinicians and those responsible for the protection of the community was crucial. The SOPs validated by the SPILF and its affiliates were disseminated to a wide range of key stakeholders through various media including workshops and the SPILF's website. CONCLUSION: SPILF can easily adapt and timely mobilize the EBR expertise in case of an alert. The present work suggests that sharing and discussing this experience, initiated at the European level, can generate a new collective expertise and needs to be further developed and strengthened.","Coignard-Biehler, H.; Rapp, C.; Chapplain, J.M.; Hoen, B.; Che, D.; Berthelot, P.; Cazenave-Roblot, F.; Rabaud, C.; Brouqui, P.; Leport, C.",Med Mal Infect,602,33

More than two to three billion people worldwide still lack basic services, whereas some countries are already moving beyond SWM towards waste and resource management (WaRM) and a circular economy. This paper sets out a novel conceptual framework and global theory of waste and development, providing a road map, allowing a country or city to locate their current position and plot their way ahead. We identify nine development bands (9DBs) with significant commonalities in terms of critical challenges and developmental pressure points. DB1–DB4 reflect stepwise improvement towards the new baseline of meeting the SDG 11.6.1 indicators of universal collection and management in controlled facilities (DB5). Countries can then choose to move towards environmentally sound management and the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ (3Rs) (DB6-9), with an ultimate aspiration of ‘zero waste’. We test the 9DBs conceptual framework against historical journeys of higher income countries. The main application will be in low- and middle-income countries striving towards SDG 11.6.1, where it fills a key gap in the practitioners’ toolkit by enabling initial framing/scoping of the problem and smarter interventions to be designed and sense checked.

PURPOSE: To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (male:female, 33:57; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until they were discharged or died, or until the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by 2 groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. RESULTS: CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5 and 5), and followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35/78 [45%] to 49/79 [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked (30/78 [38%]) on illness days 12-17, and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent sub-type of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20/50 [40%] to 20/28 [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14/50 [28%)]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. 66/70 (94%) patients discharged had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT scores and zones involved: 4 and 4), with ground-glass opacity (42/70 [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31/42 [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. CONCLUSION: The extent of lung abnormalities on CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness.","Wang, Yuhui; Dong, Chengjun; Hu, Yue; Li, Chungao; Ren, Qianqian; Zhang, Xin; Shi, Heshui; Zhou, Min",Radiology,602,18

However, individual social contact data and population mobility data can offer near real-time proxy information. The aim of this study is to compare social contact data and population mobility data with respect to their ability to reflect transmission dynamics during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: We quantified the change in social contact patterns derived from self-reported contact survey data collected by the German COVIMOD study from 04/2020 to 06/2020 (compared to the pre-pandemic period from previous studies) and estimated the percentage mean reduction over time. We compared these results as well as the percentage mean reduction in population mobility data (corrected for pre-pandemic mobility) with and without the introduction of scaling factors and specific weights for different types of contacts and mobility to the relative reduction in transmission dynamics measured by changes in R values provided by the German Public Health Institute. RESULTS: We observed the largest reduction in social contacts (90%, compared to pre-pandemic data) in late April corresponding to the strictest contact reduction measures. Thereafter, the reduction in contacts dropped continuously to a minimum of 73% in late June. Relative reduction of infection dynamics derived from contact survey data underestimated the one based on reported R values in the time of strictest contact reduction measures but reflected it well thereafter. Relative reduction of infection dynamics derived from mobility data overestimated the one based on reported R values considerably throughout the study. After the introduction of a scaling factor, specific weights for different types of contacts and mobility reduced the mean absolute percentage error considerably; in all analyses, estimates based on contact data reflected measured R values better than those based on mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Contact survey data reflected infection dynamics better than population mobility data, indicating that both data sources cover different dimensions of infection dynamics. The use of contact type-specific weights reduced the mean absolute percentage errors to less than 1%. Measuring the changes in mobility alone is not sufficient for understanding the changes in transmission dynamics triggered by public health measures.

The major themes that emerged from the data collected were related to the information systems in use, data quality and ownership, as well as client identity management. The recurring core theme throughout all interviews was related to ineffective leadership and management, contributing to each major theme. Overwhelmingly the results show that the majority of barriers faced in this province are human-related. It is concluded that while blockchain technology shows promise for enhancing data sharing in healthcare, it is still many years away from being implemented in this Canadian province. As the results of this study indicate, there are human related barriers that could be addressed in the meantime, which are outside the scope of a technical solution.

However, few qualitative studies have explored how online therapy is experienced in practice and discussed its implications for those working clients. Semi-structured interviews attended by nine integrative psychotherapists practising in California, the United States, were conducted. Thematic analysis of the transcripts identified three themes: (i) ‘Positive experiences of online therapy’, (ii) ‘Challenges experienced by therapists and clients in online therapy’, and (iii) ‘Preparation and training for online therapy’. Online therapy was assessed as being helpful, particularly in terms of mitigating against previous geographical and temporal barriers to uptake. However, due to technological disruptions and potential blurring of professional boundaries, online therapy may detract from the emotional salience of therapy, negatively impacting the therapeutic relationship and containment. Considering these positive experiences, participants expected that the demand for online therapy would continue to increase. Particularly in the occupational context, online therapy can offer interventions without fostering shame regarding mental health. The findings provide preliminary qualitative evidence that online therapy can be a useful adjunct to traditional forms of face-to-face therapy. However, therapists require more explicit training in implementing online therapy.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: An online survey using anonymous network sampling was conducted in China from April to May 2020 using a 74-item questionnaire. A national sample of 10,545 adults in 31 provinces provided data on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related mental distress, and changes in behavioral outcomes. Structural equation models were used for data analyses. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, greater mental distress was associated with increased smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20–1.68 and OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.31–1.82 per one standard deviation [SD] increase in mental distress) and alcohol consumption (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.45–1.92 and OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.24–1.75 per one SD increase in mental distress) among current smokers and drinkers and with both increased and decreased physical activity (ORs ranged from 1.32 to 1.56). Underweight adults were more likely to lose body weight (≥1 kg; OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.30–2.04), whereas overweight adults were more likely to gain weight (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.46–1.78) by the same amount. Association between mental distress and change in physical activity was stronger in adults aged ≥40 years (ORs ranged from 1.43 to 2.05) and those with high education (ORs ranged from 1.43 to 1.77).

However, data assessing this strategy are sparse, especially for the use of CPAP as a ceiling of care, and particularly when delivered outside of a traditional critical care environment. We describe a cohort of patients from Liverpool, UK, who received CPAP on a dedicated respiratory surge unit at the start of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in UK. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients receiving CPAP for the treatment of respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 on the respiratory surge unit at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, Liverpool, UK from 21 September until 30 November 2020. RESULTS: 88 patients were included in the analysis. 56/88 (64%) were deemed suitable for escalation to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and received CPAP as a trial; 32/88 (36%) received CPAP as a ceiling of care. Median age was 63 years (IQR: 56–74) and 58/88 (66%) were men. Median SpO(2)/FiO(2) immediately prior to CPAP initiation was 95 (92–152). Among patients for escalation to IMV, the median time on CPAP was 6 days (IQR 4–7) and survival at day 30 was 84% (47/56) with 14/56 (25%) escalated to IMV. Of those patients for whom CPAP was ceiling of care, the median duration of CPAP was 9 days (IQR 7–11) and 18/32 (56%) survived to day 30. Pulmonary barotrauma occurred in 9% of the cohort. There were no associations found on multivariant analysis that were associated with all-cause 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: With adequate planning and resource redistribution, CPAP may be delivered effectively outside of a traditional critical care setting for the treatment of respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Clinicians delivering CPAP to patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis should be alert to the dangers of pulmonary barotrauma. Among patients who are for escalation of care, the use of CPAP may avoid the need for IMV in some patients. Our data support the NHS England recommendation to consider CPAP as a ceiling of care.","Nightingale, Rebecca; Lewis, Joseph; Monsell, Katelyn Rhiannon; Jones, Lewis; Smith, Christopher; Kundu, Shantanu; Bond, Helena; Burhan, Hassan; Fletcher, Tom; Blanchard, Thomas; Beadsworth, Michael; Hampshire, Peter; Gautam, Manish; Todd, Stacy; Jones, Gareth; Aston, Stephen",BMJ Open Respir Res,602,24

METHODS: We report two asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) shortly after starting cladribine therapy, both developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. RESULTS: Patients with MS who are under newly initiated treatment with cladribine tablets may experience an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and they may develop immunity against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: These observations raise the probability that DMTs with immunosuppressive effects, such as cladribine, may be considered as a treatment option for selected MS patients with high disease activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Seferoğlu, Meral; Ethemoğlu, Özlem; Turan, Ömer Faruk; Siva, Aksel",Neurol Sci,602,17

However, there is currently no experimental evidence to support or against its clinical use. We evaluated the antiviral efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir along with other two viral protease inhibitors in vitro, and discussed the possible inhibitory mechanism in silico. The in vitro to in vivo extrapolation was carried out to assess whether lopinavir/ritonavir could be effective in clinical. Among the four tested compounds, lopinavir showed the best inhibitory effect against the novel coronavirus infection. However, further in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of pharmacokinetics suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir could not reach effective concentration under standard dosing regimen [marketed as Kaletra(®), contained lopinavir/ritonavir (200 mg/50 mg) tablets, recommended dosage is 400 mg/10 mg (2 tablets) twice daily]. This research concluded that lopinavir/ritonavir should be stopped for clinical use due to the huge gap between in vitro IC(50) and free plasma concentration.

That procedure is time consuming, costly, and relies heavily on reagent quality. Here, we constructed a novel infectious SINV cDNA construct that expresses its genomic RNA in yeast cells controlled by galactose induction. Using spheroplasts made from this yeast, we established a robust polyethylene glycol-mediated yeast: BHK-21 fusion protocol to rescue infectious SINV particles.

The study explored personal, clinical, and technology factors predicting cancer survivors’ electronic communication with clinicians. METHODS: Data for this investigation came from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS5, Cycle 2) that included 593 respondents who previously or currently had cancer. Multivariate regression analyses were used to predict electronic communication with clinicians. Predictors included demographic variables and health status, technology use (online health information-seeking behavior, tracking of health-related data such as using a Fitbit), and quality of past communication experiences with clinicians. RESULTS: In this pre COVID-19 sample, 42% respondents (N = 252) did not engage in any type of electronic communication (e.g., emailing, texting, data sharing) with providers. In multivariate analyses, predictors of more electronic communication with clinicians included frequency of seeking health-related information online (ß = .267, p < .001) and better communication experiences with clinicians (ß = .028, p = .034), while no demographic variable showed significance. The technology use variables (online health information seeking, health tracking) were significantly higher predictors of electronic communication with clinicians (ΔR(2) = .142, p < .001) than was past experiences with clinicians (ΔR(2) = .029, p = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Access and past experience with interactive media technologies are strong predictors of cancer patients’ electronic communication than with clinicians. Adoption of telehealth technology likely depends as much on patients’ relationships with technology as it does their relationships with clinicians. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Since Covid-19, cancer care providers have turned to telehealth provide patients with needed cancer care services. Enhancing patients’ digital competence and experience with electronic communication will help them more easily navigate telehealth care. Providers can leverage their relationship with patients to facilitate more effective use of telehealth services.","Wu, Qiwei L.; Street, Richard L.",Patient Educ Couns,602,32

Stressful and cognitively demanding events can disrupt EFs and interfere with health behavior, possibly to a greater extent in those with preexisting EF deficits. This study examined the association between preexisting EF deficits and subsequent negative changes in eating patterns, physical activity, sedentariness, and alcohol/substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Participants were 374 young adults in a follow-up study of the longitudinal, multisite Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Preexisting EF deficits were assessed with the Barkley Deficits in Executive Function Scales-Short Form, and personally impactful negative changes in four health behaviors (physical activity, unhealthy eating, sedentary time, alcohol/substance use) during the COVID-19 pandemic were subsequently assessed with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory. RESULTS: In ordered logistic regression models, higher preexisting total EF deficits were associated with greater negative impactful changes in physical activity and unhealthy eating, independent of sociodemographic variables, obesity, and (as relevant) accelerometer-based physical activity and pre-COVID-19 diet quality. Socioeconomic status moderated the association between total EF deficits and impactful change in alcohol/substance use, with EF deficits linked to greater impactful change in alcohol/substance use only in higher socioeconomic strata. CONCLUSION: Individuals with preexisting EF deficits appear more vulnerable to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on several key health behaviors. As the pandemic unfolds, strategies may be needed to identify those with EF deficits (e.g., screening tools) and provide them with tailored support for chronic disease risk reduction.","Appelhans, Bradley M.; Thomas, Alexis S.; Roisman, Glenn I.; Booth-LaForce, Cathryn; Bleil, Maria E.",Int J Behav Med,602,32

This allows for the simultaneous analysis of both global and domestic production fragmentation, the complex patterns of their evolution and their impact on economic development. The main contribution of the proposed methodology is conceptual: it permits the measurement of all value chain paths that pass through each country-sector from production to final consumption, whether the path includes downstream linkages, upstream linkages or their combination. Empirical application of this methodology shows the importance of including domestic fragmentation in value chain analysis: The fragmentation of both global and domestic levels of production has a significant positive correlation with economic growth. This implies that the effects of global production fragmentation must be analysed together with the changing structure of the fragmentation of domestic production to obtain the whole picture, one that might provide important information for policymaking and industrial policy.","Knez, Klemen; Jaklič, Andreja; Stare, Metka",J Econ Struct,602,26

This phenomenon has been well-documented in response to several natural and man-made disasters, but its global scope and severity in the context of COVID-19 are unprecedented. This response can negatively impact health, food security, and disease prevention efforts. Attempts to modify such behaviors are more likely to succeed if they are based on insights from both the biomedical and the social sciences. From a biological perspective, the phenomenological overlap between panic buying and psychological disorders such as hoarding disorder and compulsive buying raises the possibility of a shared neurobiological underpinning. Evolutionary models suggest that these behaviors represent an attempt to enhance individual and group survival in the face of a threatened scarcity of resources. These phenomena may be influenced by specific genetic variants which are also implicated in hoarding-related psychological disorders. From a psychological perspective, attachment theory provides a conceptual framework that serves as a bridge between prior life adversity, current deprivation, and an increased attachment to material objects. Such a framework is of relevance when considering panic buying during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been associated with significant disruptions in attachment bonds. From a social-anthropological perspective, hoarding and related behaviors have been associated with social exclusion and rejection, as well a lack of social support. These risk factors have affected large sections of the general population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it. This perspective also emphasizes the symbolic significance of the hoarded objects themselves. In this paper, an attempt is made to integrate these three perspectives and thereby formulate a biopsychosocial model of panic buying in response to this global health crisis. The existing scientific literature on panic buying is examined in the light of this model. Finally, suggestions are proposed as to how this model might inform social strategies aimed at preventing or reducing panic buying.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Front Psychiatry,602,17

Here we describe efforts to collect attitudinal and behavioural data and disseminate insights to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. METHODS: We developed a rapid data collection and monitoring system based on a cross-national online survey, the “COVID-19 Health Behavior Survey”. Respondent recruitment occurred via targeted Facebook advertisements in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We investigated how the threat perceptions of COVID-19, the confidence in the preparedness of organisations to deal with the pandemic, and the adoption of preventive and social distancing behaviours are associated with respondents’ demographic characteristics. RESULTS: We analysed 71,612 questionnaires collected between March 13-April 19, 2020. We found substantial spatio-temporal heterogeneity across countries at different stages of the pandemic and with different control strategies in place. Respondents rapidly adopted the use of face masks when they were not yet mandatory. We observed a clear pattern in threat perceptions, sharply increasing from a personal level to national and global levels. Although personal threat perceptions were comparatively low, all respondents significantly increased hand hygiene. We found gender-specific patterns: women showed higher threat perceptions, lower confidence in the healthcare system, and were more likely to adopt preventive behaviours. Finally, we also found that older people perceived higher threat to themselves, while all respondents were strongly concerned about their family. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid population surveys conducted via Facebook allow us to monitor behavioural changes, adoption of protective measures, and compliance with recommended practices. As the pandemic progresses and new waves of infections are a threatening reality, timely insights from behavioural and attitudinal data are crucial to guide the decision-making process.

It manifests with several symptoms, on a spectrum from asymptomatic to severe illness and death. Many typical imaging features of this disease are described, such as bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) or consolidations with a predominantly peripheral distribution. COVID-19-associated bronchiectasis is an atypical finding, and it is not a commonly described sequel of the disease. Here, we present a previously healthy middle-aged man who developed progressive bronchiectasis evident on serial chest CT scans with superimposed bacterial infection following COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient's complicated hospital course of superimposed bacterial infection in the setting of presumed bronchiectasis secondary to COVID-19 is alleged to have contributed to his prolonged hospital stay, with difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation. Clinicians should have high suspicion and awareness of such a debilitating complication, as further follow-up and management might be warranted.","Suliman, Aasir M; Bitar, Bassel W; Farooqi, Amer A; Elarabi, Anam M; Aboukamar, Mohamed R; Abdulhadi, Ahmed S",Cureus,602,1

Affected patients can observe a wide variety of neurological symptoms, such as myoclonus, dementia, cerebellar signs, and others. We present a case of laboratory-confirmed SE in an otherwise healthy 57-year-old medical professional who initially presented with nonspecific and unique ""head in a fish-bowl"" dissociation and cognitive decline. No social risk factors were ever identified other than his healthcare career, but subsequent neuroimaging, serology, and lumbar puncture confirmed a diagnosis of sporadic SE due to unknown etiology. He was then treated symptomatically and referred ultimately to palliative care. The patient passed while in hospice care with time from the initial diagnosis to mortality being only 42 days. Given his vague but uniquely rapid deterioration and subsequent mortality, we highlight an opportunity to discuss diagnosis, management, quality improvement, and ethical concerns associated with SE prognosis. We aim to help primary care physicians and neurologists better elucidate the risk factors, signs and symptoms, and pathophysiology of SE to make an early diagnosis. Symptoms can then be managed effectively and palliative services coordinated via a legal and compassionate shared decision-making approach. We recommend that once a diagnosis is made, a discussion with the patient and their family about advance directives and end-of-life care be coordinated as soon as reasonably possible. This should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team consisting of the patient's primary care physician and neurologist, as well as a social worker, palliative care physician, and counselor (spiritual or otherwise). It is our hope that through a better understanding of these factors in SE care, quality of life improvement protocols in similarly-debilitating neurocognitive diseases can be developed.","Kortz, Michael W; Kongs, Brian M; Middleton, Lauren E",Cureus,602,27

Mitigation measures included physical distancing, universal masking, and maximizing outdoor activity during training; routine testing; 10-day isolation of persons with COVID-19; and 14-day quarantine of athletes identified as close contacts* of persons with confirmed COVID-19. Regional athletic conferences created testing and quarantine policies based on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidance (1); testing policies varied by conference, school, and sport. To improve compliance with quarantine and reduce the personal and economic burden of quarantine adherence, the quarantine period has been reduced in several countries from 14 days to as few as 5 days with testing (2) or 10 days without testing (3). Data on quarantined athletes participating in NCAA sports were used to characterize COVID-19 exposures and assess the amount of time between quarantine start and first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Despite the potential risk for transmission from frequent, close contact associated with athletic activities (4), more athletes reported exposure to COVID-19 at social gatherings (40.7%) and from roommates (31.7%) than they did from exposures associated with athletic activities (12.7%). Among 1,830 quarantined athletes, 458 (25%) received positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results during the 14-day quarantine, with a mean of 3.8 days from quarantine start (range = 0-14 days) until the positive test result. Among athletes who had not received a positive test result by quarantine day 5, the probability of having a positive test result decreased from 27% after day 5 to <5% after day 10. These findings support new guidance from CDC (5) in which different options are provided to shorten quarantine for persons such as collegiate athletes, especially if doing so will increase compliance, balancing the reduced duration of quarantine against a small but nonzero risk for postquarantine transmission. Improved adherence to mitigation measures (e.g., universal masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene) at all times could further reduce exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and disruptions to athletic activities because of infections and quarantine (1,6).","Atherstone, Christine; Peterson, Meaghan L.; Malone, Mackenzie; Honein, Margaret A.; MacNeil, Adam; O’Neal, Catherine S.; Paul, Stephen; Harmon, Kimberly G.; Goerl, Kyle; Wolfe, Cameron R.; Casani, Julie; Barrios, Lisa C.; Aukerman, Douglas; Bray, James E.; Bisong, Charlz; Cornelius, January; Czarnik, Michaila; Fershteyn, Zarina; Terrell, Metrecia; Bui, David; Kassinger, Craig; Carr McCuin, Dametreea; Cohen, Randy P.; Daniels, Todd P.; Helming, Bruce; Millward, David; Porter, Donald; Clugston, James R.; Courson, Ron; Randa, Anna; Divine, Jon; Duffaut, Calvin; Fahy, Katherine; Angeles, Los; Hatamiya, Nicolas; Honsvall, Amanda; Miller, Emily; Pocinich, Mark; Angeles, Los; Nattiy, Aurelia; de St. Maurice, Annabelle; Vigil, Daniel; Goodlett, Michael D.; Hagan, Kent; Kirk, Michele; Madaleno, James A.; Merkle, Jonathan; Moon, Kim; Sutherland, Janna; Pierce, Timmy; Vinson, Daniel; Robinson, James B.; Sakomato, Takamasa; Salazar, Luis D.; Selfridge, Mollie; Shubow, Kevin; Stanley, Owen; Whitt, Stevan P.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,602,23

The association of viral infections with demyelinating disease, in both animals and humans, will be discussed, as will the potential contributions of peripheral infection with Torque Teno virus, infection outside of and/or within the CNS with Epstein-Barr virus and infection within the CNS with Human Herpesvirus 6 to MS. An experimental animal model, Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible strains of mice is an example of viral infections of the CNS as a prerequisite for demyelination. Finally, the proposition that multiple virus infections, which first prime the immune system and then trigger the disease, as a model where infections outside of the CNS lead to inflammatory changes within the CNS, are required for the development of a MS-like disease is explored.","Libbey, Jane E.; Fujinami, Robert S.",Molecular Basis of Multiple Sclerosis,602,1

During the COVID-19 pandemic, HHAs may face additional challenges caring for these vulnerable patients. Our objective was to explore COVID-19 preparedness of U.S. HHAs and compare results by urban/rural location. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting/Participants Using a stratified random sample of 978 HHAs, we conducted a 22-item online survey from April 10 to 17, 2020. Methods Summary statistics were computed; open-ended narrative responses were synthesized using qualitative methods. Results Similar to national data, most responding HHAs (n=121, 12% response rate) were for-profit and located in the South. A majority of HHAs had infectious disease outbreaks included in their emergency preparedness plan (76%), a staff member in charge of outbreak/disaster preparedness (84%), and had provided their staff with COVID-19 education and training (97%). More urban HHAs had cared for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 patients than rural HHAs, but urban HHAs had less capacity to test for COVID-19 than rural HHAs (9% vs 21%). Most (69%) experienced patient census declines and had a current and/or anticipated supply shortage. Rural agencies were impacted less than urban agencies. HHAs have already rationed (69%) or implemented extended use (55%) or limited reuse (61%) of personal protective equipment (PPE). Many HHAs reported accessing supplemental PPE from state/local resources, donations, and do-it-yourself efforts; more rural HHAs had accessed these additional resources compared to urban HHAs. Conclusions/Implications This survey reveals challenges that HHAs are having in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among urban agencies. Of greatest concern are the declines in patient census, which drastically impact agency revenue, and the shortages of PPE and disinfectants. Without proper protection, HHA clinicians are at risk of self-exposure and viral transmission to patients and vulnerable family members.","Shang, Jingjing; Chastain, Ashley M.; Perera, Uduwanage Gayani E.; Quigley, Denise D.; Fu, Caroline J.; Dick, Andrew W.; Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika; Stone, Patricia W.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,602,1

Unfortunately, many medical educators have been forced to quickly create distance-learning options for trainees with little prior experience. In this perspective, we review the evidence base for distance learning and discuss practical considerations for transitioning traditional in-person curricula to distance platforms. We review technical aspects of distance learning as well as educational principles essential for success. The goal is for medical educators to optimize distance learning not just during this COVID-19 pandemic but beyond this crisis as well.","Brady, Anna K.; Pradhan, Deepak",ATS scholar,602,16

Chest X-Ray (CXR) radiological imaging coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, in particular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can speed the COVID-19 diagnostic process. In this paper, we optimize the data augmentation and the CNN hyperparameters for detecting COVID-19 from CXRs in terms of validation accuracy. This optimization increases the accuracy of the popular CNN architectures such as the Visual Geometry Group network (VGG-19) and the Residual Neural Network (ResNet-50), by 11.93% and 4.97%, respectively.

Carcasses were stored in a cold room at 4 °C. After 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 h of storage, necropsies were carried out.

IBV was detected by RT-PCR at all sampling times, except for 1 and 6 h of storage in kidney and 9 h of storage in kidney and rectum. For ECE, isolation was obtained at all sampling points, except at 1 and 24 h of storage in lungs. Isolation by tracheal organ cultures was less successful, except from rectum. In addition to sampling for virus, tracheal washes were collected from each carcass to measure the ability to detect local antibodies after storage. Levels of IgA in tracheal washes remained high for up to 9 h of storage, suggesting that accurate sampling for research purposes when required must be carried out within this time.","Ganapathy, Kannan; Cargill, Peter Walker; Jones, Richard Charles",J Virol Methods,602,20

This region is also known as the ‘five prime untranslated region’ (Figure 1) of the mRNA. Leader sequences have the propensity for forming secondary structures (stem-loops) by base pairing of complementary sequences. They are involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the leader sequence may vary from few nucleotides to more than 1000 nucleotides. In prokaryotes, the leader sequences are usually short and at times contain an attenuator segment that is translated to a short-leader peptide. The leader peptide functions to terminate transcripts before the RNA polymerase reaches the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequences in viruses have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, replication, and pathogenicity. Mutations in the leader sequences of cellular mRNAs can have implications for disease and tumorigenesis.","Samal, S.K.",Brenner's Encyclopedia of Genetics,602,1

The overall signature of metabolic biomarker associations was similar for the risk of severe pneumonia and severe COVID-19. A multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 proteins, fatty acids, amino acids, and lipids, was associated equally strongly with enhanced susceptibility to severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 2.9 [95%CI 2.1–3.8] for highest vs lowest quintile) and severe pneumonia events occurring 7–11 years after blood sampling (2.6 [1.7–3.9]). However, the risk for severe pneumonia occurring during the first 2 years after blood sampling for people with elevated levels of the multi-biomarker score was over four times higher than for long-term risk (8.0 [4.1–15.6]). If these hypothesis generating findings on increased susceptibility to severe pneumonia during the first few years after blood sampling extend to severe COVID-19, metabolic biomarker profiling could potentially complement existing tools for identifying individuals at high risk. These results provide novel molecular understanding on how metabolic biomarkers reflect the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and other infections in the general population.","Julkunen, Heli; Cichońska, Anna; Slagboom, P Eline; Würtz, Peter",eLife,602,23

The highest fear mean scores were found among Lab-Technicians (20.19 ± 7.42), followed by X-ray-Technicians (17.95 ± 3.96), Nurses (17.1 ± 5.55), and Physicians (16.25 ± 4.66). CONCLUSION: The fear of COVID-19 was high among female healthcare professionals compared to males, as well as, among Lab-Technicians compared to Physicians and Nurses. There is a need to establish a strategy to continues measuring the psychological effect of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals especially females.","Shehada, Ameer Khalil; Albelbeisi, Ahmed Hassan; Albelbeisi, Ali; El Bilbeisi, Abdel Hamid; El Afifi, Amany",SAGE Open Med,602,5

An optimal rehabilitation model for this group of patients has not yet been established. This randomized prospective study assessed the effectiveness and safety of a 6-month home-based caregiver-supervised rehabilitation program among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. METHODS: A total of 39 patients with PAH were divided into two groups: intervention group (16 patients), subjected to a 6-month home-based physical training and respiratory rehabilitation program adapted to the clinical status of participants, and control group (23 patients) who did not perform physical training. The 6-min walk test (6MWT), measurement of respiratory muscle strength, quality of life assessment (SF-36, Fatigue Severity Scale – FSS) were performed before study commencement, and after 6 and 12 months. Adherence to exercise protocol and occurrence of adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS: Physical training significantly improved 6MWT distance (by 71.38 ± 83.4 m after 6 months (p = 0.004), which remained increased after 12 months (p = 0.043), and respiratory muscle strength after 6 and 12 months (p < 0.01). Significant improvement in quality of life was observed after the training period with the use of the SF-36 questionnaire (Physical Functioning, p < 0.001; Role Physical, p = 0.015; Vitality, p = 0.022; Role Emotional, p = 0.029; Physical Component Summary, p = 0.005), but it did not persist after study completion. Adherence to exercise protocol was on average 91.88 ± 14.1%. No serious adverse events were noted. CONCLUSION: According to study results, the home-based rehabilitation program dedicated to PAH patients is safe and effective. It improves functional parameters and quality of life. Strength of respiratory muscles and 6MWD remain increased 6 months after training cessation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03780803.

Therefore, identifying parental burnout protection factors is essential. This study aimed to assess the protective role of the following factors which can be increased through mindfulness practice: trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and concrete vs. abstract ruminations. A total of 459 parents (M(age) = 40; 98.7% female) completed self-reported questionnaires at two-time points to assess the predictive role of mindfulness on parental burnout, self-compassion and rumination type, and the mediating role of self-compassion and rumination type in the relation between mindfulness and parental burnout. Results showed that trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination type at Time 1 predicted levels of parental burnout at Time 2. Self-compassion (indirect effects: b = − 22, 95% CI = [−38, −05], p < 0.01), concrete ruminations (indirect effects: b = −20, 95% CI = [−32, −09], p < 0.001), and abstract ruminations (indirect effects: b = −0.54, 95% CI = [−71, −37], p < 0.001) partially mediated the relation between trait-mindfulness and parental burnout. These findings showed that trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and concrete (vs. abstract) ruminations may help prevent parental burnout in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results contribute to the field of research on parental burnout prevention and will allow for the development of effective approaches to mental health promotion in parents.","Paucsik, Marine; Urbanowicz, Agata; Leys, Christophe; Kotsou, Ilios; Baeyens, Céline; Shankland, Rebecca",Int J Environ Res Public Health,602,17

The sudden shift to online education meant the loss of traditional activities for students to learn communication skills creating a critical demand for open educational resources for students and nursing faculty. Tools to support nursing faculty development for teaching communication are nearly non-existent and pedagogical content knowledge is needed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test two COMFORT COVID-19 Communication Modules (PPE and Video/Phone) for undergraduate nursing students and evaluate student communication competency post-intervention. DESIGN: This pre-post study includes qualitative and quantitative data collected to evaluate student communication competency post-intervention. SETTINGS: Undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) students at four university campuses in the Pacific and MidSouth regions of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: BSN nursing students (n = 197) predominantly in the third year of study (n = 138, 70%). METHODS: Students completed online modules as part of a nursing course. Faculty provided information and a link to access online learning modules. A pre-post assessment was completed for each module. RESULTS: Significant statistical differences were found across variables of communication attitude, knowledge, and skill across both modules. CONCLUSIONS: As nursing education in the United States shifts to competency-based education which emphasizes skill development across the BSN program, it is imperative to establish communication learning objectives that are measurable and ensure communication theory and evidence-based practice is part of curriculum content.","Wittenberg, Elaine; Goldsmith, Joy V.; Chen, Chiahui; Prince-Paul, Maryjo; Capper, Beverly",Nurse Educ Today,602,12

Few studies have examined the impact of treatment with NK1 antagonists on opioid response in humans. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential for a selective NK1 antagonist, tradipitant, to attenuate the abuse liability and reinforcing and analgesic effects of oxycodone in opioid-experienced individuals. METHODS: Participants with recreational opioid use, but without opioid physical dependence, were enrolled as inpatients for ~6 weeks (n = 8). A within-subject, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design was employed. The pharmacodynamic response to intranasal oxycodone across a range of doses (0 to 30 mg) was examined during two counterbalanced maintenance periods (tradipitant 0 or 85 mg/bid). Oxycodone self-administration was assessed with a modified progressive ratio procedure, and analgesia was assessed with the cold pressor test. RESULTS: Oxycodone produced significant and dose-related increases on a broad array of prototypic opioid measures, including subjective ratings related to abuse liability (e.g., liking) and physiological outcomes (i.e., expired CO(2)). Oxycodone self-administration increased with increasing dose, as did analgesia. Tradipitant largely did not alter any of these effects of oxycodone, with the exception of producing a reduction in ratings of desire for opioids. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the vast majority of oxycodone effects were unchanged by tradipitant, these data do not provide support for the utility of NK1 antagonists as a potential treatment for opioid use disorder.","Coe, Marion A.; Lofwall, Michelle R.; Vessels, Victoria; Nuzzo, Paul A.; Walsh, Sharon L.",Psychopharmacology (Berl),602,21

Given widespread polarization in America, what lies ahead? We describe two possible futures, each based on different sets of theory and evidence. On one hand, polarization may be on a self-reinforcing upward trajectory fueled by misperception and avoidance; on the other hand it may have recently reached the apex of its pendulum swing.

The clinical and epidemiologic utilities of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 testing are under debate. Characterizing these assays helps to understand the disease and provides scientific basis for deciding how to best use these assays. The study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total Antibody Test). Validation included 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 1182 samples from negative controls with potential interferences/cross-reactions, including 1063 pre-pandemic samples. IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as early as post-symptom onset days 3-4. IgG antibodies were first detected post-onset days 5-6 by SQ assays. The detection rates increased gradually, and SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total detected antibodies from all the PCR-confirmed patients 14 days after symptom onset. Overall agreements between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total was 88.5% and between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG was 94.6% (Kappa = 0.75, 0.89). No cross-reaction with other endemic coronavirus infections were identified. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main cross-reactions observed. However, the interferences/cross-reactions were low. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total and 99.62% for Abbott IgG and 98.87% for SQ IgM.

Median interquartile range (IQR) time between onset of symptoms and ICU admission was 11.5 (6.25–17.75) days. In 15 patients, lung cavitations were already present on the first CT scan, performed after ICU admission; in seven patients they developed during a subsequent median (IQR) observation period of 48 (35–58) days. In seven patients we found at least one cavitation with a diameter > 2 cm (maximum 10 cm). Patients who developed cavitations were older and had a higher body mass index. Autopsy findings in three patients revealed that the cavitations reflected lung infarcts undergoing liquefaction, secondary to thrombotic pulmonary artery branch occlusions.

A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing (91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family.

Principal pathogens include Escherichia coli, rotaviruses, and noroviruses. 90% of diarrhoeal deaths are attributable to inadequate sanitation. Acute diarrhoea is the second leading cause of overall childhood mortality and accounts for 18% of deaths among children under five. In 2004 an estimated 1.5 million children died from diarrhoea, with 80% of deaths occurring before the age of two. Treatment goals are to prevent dehydration and nutritional damage and to reduce duration and severity of diarrhoeal episodes. The recommended therapeutic regimen is to provide oral rehydration solutions (ORS) and to continue feeding. Although ORS effectively mitigates dehydration, it has no effect on the duration, severity, or frequency of diarrhoeal episodes. Adjuvant therapy with micronutrients, probiotics, or antidiarrhoeal agents may thus be useful. The WHO recommends the use of zinc tablets in association with ORS. The ESPGHAN/ESPID treatment guidelines consider the use of racecadotril, diosmectite, or probiotics as possible adjunctive therapy to ORS. Only racecadotril and diosmectite reduce stool output, but no treatment has yet been shown to reduce hospitalisation rate or mortality.

The COVID-19 pandemic created disruptions in daily life; however, it is unknown whether the pandemic’s disruptions affected the ability for adults with T2DM to control their condition. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap with the experiences of adults with T2DM in Arkansas, U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study analyzed cross-sectional, observational survey data collected from adults (≥18 years) who live, work, or receive healthcare in Arkansas; self-reported a diagnosis of T2DM; and completed the diabetes module of the Impact of COVID-19 online survey (n = 131) fielded in July–August 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and survey responses, and multivariate regression was used to identify demographics, self-care behaviors, and access issues associated with uncontrolled T2DM (HbA1c ≥ 9% or 74.9 mmol/mol) or with an increase in HbA1c. RESULTS: 28.2% reported an increase in their HbA1c since the pandemic began, and 18.2% had uncontrolled T2DM. Educational level, eating healthily, and weight gain were negatively associated with uncontrolled T2DM. Eating less healthily and having difficulty accessing diabetes related medication were positively associated with an increase in HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with T2DM in Arkansas were reasonably able to maintain control of their T2DM during the five months post the first case of COVD-19 diagnosed in the state. However, T2DM self-management interventions targeting those with lower educational levels that are focused on eating habits and/or that improve access to diabetes medication should be considered for future public health emergencies.","Felix, Holly C.; Andersen, Jennifer A.; Willis, Don E.; Malhis, Joseph R.; Selig, James P.; McElfish, Pearl A.",Prim Care Diabetes,602,21

Methods and Materials Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were randomized to 1 Gy whole-lung LDRT or sham irradiation (sham-RT). Treatment group allocation was concealed from patients and ICU clinicians, who treated patients according to the current standard of care. Patients were followed for the primary endpoint of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at day 15 post-intervention. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, as well as changes in oxygenation and inflammatory markers. Results Twenty-two patients were randomized to either whole-lung LDRT or sham-RT between November and December 2020. Patients were generally elderly and comorbid, with a median age of 75 years in both arms. No difference in 15-day VFDs was observed between groups (p = 1.00), with a median of 0 days (range, 0-9) in the LDRT arm, and 0 days (range, 0-13) in the sham-RT arm.

Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for most countries. However, relatively little attention has been given to the age distributions of hospitalizations and serious healthcare interventions administered to COVID-19 patients. We examined these distributions in Ontario, Canada, in order to quantify the age-related impacts of COVID-19, and to identify potential risks should the healthcare system become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients in the future. Methods: We analysed known SARS-CoV-2 infection records from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) and the Toronto Public Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES) between 23 January 2020 and 17 June 2020 (N = 30,546), and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. Results: The distribution of COVID-19-related hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 54-90, whereas deaths are sharply concentrated in very old ages, with a maximum at age 90. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection reaches a maximum of 32.0% at age 75 (95% CI 27.5%-36.7%). The probability of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization is uncertain for children (due to small sample size), and near 100% for adults younger than 40. After age 40, survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients declines substantially; for example, a hospitalized 50-year-old patient has a 90.4% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 81.9%-95.7%). Interpretation: Concerted efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have kept prevalence of the virus low in the population of Ontario. The healthcare system has not been overstretched, yet the probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 has been lower than is generally recognized for patients over 40. If prevalence of the virus were to increase and healthcare capacities were to be exceeded, survival of individuals in the broad age range requiring acute care would be expected to decrease, potentially expanding the distribution of COVID-19-related deaths toward younger ages.","Papst, I.; Li, M.; Champredon, D.; Bolker, B.

DD levels showed a significant correlation with PE occurrence and extent in pulmonary branches, despite anticoagulant therapies; trend of correlation with pulmonary stages was also noted. CONCLUSIONS: PE is a frequent complication in severe COVID-19 patients, particularly during central parenchymal stages and despite ongoing anticoagulant therapy. CTA and DD levels play a crucial role in the assessment of suspected PE, despite anticoagulant therapies, along with proper information about lung involvement extent.","Valle, C.; Bonaffini, P.A.; Dal Corso, M.; Mercanzin, E.; Franco, P.N.; Sonzogni, A.; Vacca, G.; Gianatti, A.; Sironi, S.",Eur J Radiol,602,1

This study examined the knowledge, frequency, and characteristics of handwashing practices among Vietnamese university students. METHODS An analytic cross-sectional study was conducted on all students enrolling at Phenikaa University in Vietnam. A self-developed questionnaire was used to collect information on the participants' knowledge regarding the effectiveness of handwashing as a COVID-19 preventive measure, the moments for hand hygiene, the most appropriate practices in different situations, and frequency. RESULTS Among 728 study participants, 460 (63.2%) were from health-related faculties. Almost (97.9%, 713/728) all participants knew that handwashing could protect against the spread of infection, but less than half performed handwashing often in a normal day (47.4%, 345/728), after sneezing or coughing (48.9%, 356/728), and 7.4% (54/728) only washed hands when hands are visibly dirty. Health students used alcohol-based handrub in all situations including those requiring handwashing with water and soap (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The levels of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of handwashing among study participants are high, but actual practices of handwashing are suboptimal. It is crucial to improve community education to help reinforce correct hand hygiene behaviors including when to wash hands and which method should be used.","Duong, Minh Cuong; Nguyen, Hong Trang; Duong, Bich Thuy; Vu, Minh Thuy",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,602,1

On the other hand, it is accepted that DexD/H-box helicases also engage in activities that do not require helicase activity. A number of DExD/H-box helicases have been shown to be involved in anti-viral immunity. The RIG-like helicases, RIG-I, mda5 and lgp2, act as important cytosolic pattern recognition receptors for viral RNA. Detection of viral nucleic acids by the RIG-like helicases or other anti-viral pattern recognition receptors leads to the induction of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. More recently, additional DExD/H-box helicases have also been implicated to act as cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acids, including DDX3, DDX41, DHX9, DDX60, DDX1 and DHX36. However, there is evidence that at least some of these helicases might have more downstream functions in pattern recognition receptor signalling pathways, as signalling adaptors or transcriptional regulators. In an interesting twist, a lot of DExD/H-box helicases have also been identified as essential host factors for the replication of different viruses, suggesting that viruses ‘hijack’ their RNA helicase activities for their benefit. Interestingly, DDX3, DDX1 and DHX9 are among the helicases that are required for the replication of a diverse range of viruses. This might suggest that these helicases are highly contested targets in the ongoing ‘arms race’ between viruses and the host immune system.

We examine the choice between continuing or ending a full lockdown within a simple optimal control model that encompasses both health and economic outcomes, and pays particular attention to when need for care exceeds hospital capacity. The model shows that very different strategies can perform similarly well and even both be optimal for the same relative valuation on work and life because of the presence of a so-called Skiba threshold. Qualitatively the alternate strategies correspond to trying essentially to eradicate the virus or merely to flatten the curve so fewer people urgently need healthcare when hospitals are already filled to capacity.","Caulkins, Jonathan; Grass, Dieter; Feichtinger, Gustav; Hartl, Richard; Kort, Peter M.; Prskawetz, Alexia; Seidl, Andrea; Wrzaczek, Stefan",PLoS One,602,14

Rapid progression of the outbreak has led to a major global public health problem of a potentially fatal disease. On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the pandemic as the sixth public health emergency of the world. Upon this, the whole country has started to take the necessary precautions. The new coronavirus uses membrane‐bound angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter into the cells, such as SARS‐CoV, and mostly affects the respiratory tract. Symptoms of COVID‐19 patients include fever (93%), fatigue (70%), cough (70%), anorexia (40%) and dyspnoea (34.5%). The elderly and people with underlying chronic diseases are more susceptible to infection and higher mortality. Currently, a large number of drugs and vaccines studies are ongoing. In this review, we discussed the virology, epidemiological data, the replication of the virus, and its relationship with cardiovascular diseases on COVID‐19 pandemics, treatment and vaccines. Thereby, this study aims to neatly present scientific data in light of many regarding literature that can be a clue for readers who research this disease prevention and treatment.

However, the renal complications of COVID-19 are not yet well explored. This study aimed to identify the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 and to evaluate its impact on patient outcomes. This retrospective study included 704 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at two hospitals in Daegu, Korea from February 19 to March 31, 2020. AKI was defined according to the serum creatinine criteria in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. The final date of follow-up was May 1, 2020. Of the 704 patients, 28 (4.0%) developed AKI. Of the 28 patients with AKI, 15 (53.6%) were found to have AKI stage 1, 3 (10.7%) had AKI stage 2, and 10 (35.7%) had AKI stage 3. Among these patients, 12 (42.9%) recovered from AKI. In the patients with AKI, the rates of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), administration of mechanical ventilator (MV), and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher than in patients without AKI. Multivariable analysis revealed that old age (Hazard ratio [HR] = 4.668, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.250–17.430, p = 0.022), high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 1.167, 95% CI = 1.078–1.264, p < 0.001), elevated creatinine kinase (HR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.001–1.004, p = 0.007), and severe AKI (HR = 12.199, 95% CI = 4.235–35.141, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the cumulative survival rate was lowest in the AKI stage 3 group (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was 4.0%. Severe AKI was associated with in-hospital death.","Paek, Jin Hyuk; Kim, Yaerim; Park, Woo Yeong; Jin, Kyubok; Hyun, Miri; Lee, Ji Yeon; Kim, Hyun Ah; Kwon, Yong Shik; Park, Jae Seok; Han, Seungyeup",PLoS One,602,26

The aim of this work was to study the safety profile of combined ketamine and regional anesthesia in pediatric ocular surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective study included pediatric patients undergoing ocular surgery under general anesthesia from April to October 2020. Children were premedicated with oral midazolam (0.25–0.50 mg/kg) or intramuscular ketamine (7-10 mg/kg), ondensetron (0.1 mg/kg) and atropine (0.02 mg/kg). Anesthesia was achieved with intravenous ketamine (4–5 mg/kg) and local anesthesia (peribulbar block or local infiltration). The patient's vital signs were monitored. Serious complications and postoperative adverse reactions related to anesthesia were documented. RESULTS: A total of 55 children (62 eyes) were operated. Lid tear was the most common surgical procedure performed [n = 18 (32.7%)]. Dose of ketamine needed ranged from 30 to 120 mg (66.67 ± 30.45). No intubation or resuscitation was needed. Four children complained of nausea and two needed an additional dose of intravenous ondansetron due to vomiting in the post-operative period. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was not affected by age, duration of surgery or dose of ketamine used (P > 0.05). There was no correlation between increase in pulse and dose of ketamine. CONCLUSION: Combined ketamine and regional anesthesia is a safe and effective alternative to administer anesthesia in a child during ocular surgeries.","Rajput, Vimal K; Tuvar, Subhash; Bhalsing, Shweta; Bhalsing, Snehal",Indian J Ophthalmol,602,26

This fatal disease is caused by JE Virus (JEV). The current study was carried out for designing a multi-epitope loaded peptide vaccine to prevent JEV. Based on reverse vaccinology and in silico approaches, octapeptide B-cell and hexapeptide T-cell epitopes belonging to five proteins, viz. E, prM, NS1, NS3 and NS5 of JEV were determined. Hydrophilicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity and aliphatic amino acids of the epitopes were estimated. Further, the epitopes were analyzed for different physicochemical parameters, e.g. total net charges, amino acid composition and Boman index. Out of all the epitopes, a total of four T-cell epitopes namely KRADSS, KRSRRS, SKRSRR and KECPDE and one B-cell epitope i.e. PKPCSKGD were found to have potential for raising immunity in human against the pathogen. Taking into account the outcome of this study, the pharmaceutical industries could initiate efforts to combine the identified epitopes together with adjuvant or carrier protein to develop a multi-epitope-loaded peptide vaccine against JEV. The peptide vaccine, being cost effective, could be administered as a prophylactic measure and in JEV infected individuals to combat the spread of this virus in human population. However, prior to administration into human beings, the vaccine must pass through several clinical trials.","Chakraborty, Supriyo; Barman, Antara; Deb, Bornali",Infect Genet Evol,602,29

They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. Aim This rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future. Method An embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data was extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics, and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations. Results The 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy. Discussion Community pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.","Maidment, I.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of specialty education and work environment on of dentists’ behavior, awareness and attitude regarding cross-infection control in COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: The study population consisted of Turkish dentists who work in private clinics, public clinics and university hospitals. Demographics of the participants, awareness of COVID-19 and clinical measures taken against cross-infection were evaluated with an online survey. Between 10th-20th of November 2020, 1,000 surveys were e-mailed to the dentists. RESULTS: A total 454 dentists answered the survey; 29.3% of the participants deliver only urgent care, 59.9% both urgent and routine treatments and personal protective equipment (PPE) were used at rates varying between 75.5% and 98.4%. 90.6% of the dentists stated that they were worried about aerosol generating dental procedures and there was no difference between sexes in this regard (p=0.119). The majority of participants, mainly specialists (p=0.16), applied strict cross-infection control methods during the COVID-19 pandemic (77.2%).

Although its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase exhibits some exonuclease proofreading activity, viral sequence diversity can be produced by replication errors and host factors. A diversity of genetic variants can be observed in the intra-host viral population structure of infected individuals. Most mutations will follow a neutral molecular evolution and won’t make significant contributions to variations within and between infected hosts. Herein, we profiled the intra-sample genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants using high-throughput sequencing datasets from 15,289 infected individuals and infected cell lines. Most of the genetic variations observed, including C->U and G->U, were consistent with errors due to heat-induced DNA damage during sample processing and/or sequencing protocols. Despite high mutational background, we identified recurrent intra-variable positions in the samples analyzed, including several positions at the end of the gene encoding the viral Spike (S) protein. Strikingly, we observed a high-frequency C->A missense mutations resulting in the S protein lacking the last 20 amino acids (SΔ20). We found that this truncated S protein undergoes increased processing and increased syncytia formation, presumably due to escaping M protein retention in intracellular compartments. Our findings suggest the emergence of a high-frequency viral sublineage that is not horizontally transmitted but potentially involved in intra-host disease cytopathic effects. IMPORTANCE The mutation rate and evolution of RNA viruses correlate with viral adaptation. While most mutations do not have significant contributions to viral molecular evolution, some are naturally selected and cause a genetic drift through positive selection. Many recent SARS-CoV-2 variants have been recently described and show phenotypic selection towards more infectious viruses. Our study describes another type of variant that does not contribute to inter-host heterogeneity but rather phenotypic selection toward variants that might have increased cytopathic effects. We identified that a C-terminal truncation of the Spike protein removes an important ER-retention signal, which consequently results in a Spike variant that easily travels through the Golgi toward the plasma membrane in a pre-activated conformation, leading to increased syncytia formation.","Rocheleau, Lynda; Laroche, Geneviève; Fu, Kathy; Stewart, Corina M; Mohamud, Abdulhamid O; Côté, Marceline; Giguère, Patrick M; Langlois, Marc-André; Pelchat, Martin",bioRxiv,602,16
