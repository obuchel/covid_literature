4036,4036,4036,The impact of the oral cavity in febrile neutropenia and infectious complications in patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy,17.509409,7.8299417,2019-06-20,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an inflammatory response causing fever that may develop during cancer therapy-induced neutropenia. FN may herald life-threatening infectious complications and should therefore be considered a medical emergency. Patients presenting with FN are routinely subjected to careful history taking and physical examination including X-rays and microbiological evaluations. Nevertheless, an infection is documented clinically in only 20–30% of cases, whereas a causative microbial pathogen is not identified in over 70% of FN cases. The oral cavity is generally only visually inspected. Although it is recognized that ulcerative oral mucositis may be involved in the development of FN, the contribution of infections of the periodontium, the dentition, and salivary glands may be underestimated. These infections can be easily overlooked, as symptoms and signs of inflammation may be limited or absent during neutropenia. This narrative review is aimed to inform the clinician on the potential role of the oral cavity as a potential source in the development of FN. Areas for future research directed to advancing optimal management strategies are discussed.","Zecha, Judith A. E. M.; Raber-Durlacher, Judith E.; Laheij, Alexa M. G.

After eight years of a “diplomatic truce” under President Ma Ying-jeou, China re-started its multi-pronged strategy to pressure Taiwan into eventual unification, and one of the key tactics is to poach all of Taiwan's now-15 remaining diplomatic allies to eliminate its international legitimacy. This article seeks to explain what, if any, benefits formal diplomatic relations provide Taiwan and the ways in which Beijing induces countries to switch ties. It concludes by providing recommendations for what actions the United States can undertake to slow the impending completion of the “race to zero.”","Shattuck, Thomas J.",Orbis,432,1

The successful therapies in the field of lung diseases are very limited and the medical treatments available are ineffective in many of the lung diseases. Many studies have evaluated the new therapies in the acute pulmonary diseases, and the transplantation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), which is a branch of cell therapy, has a special place among the new medical techniques. The MSCs are present throughout the body and are thought to play a role in tissue regeneration and inflammation control. In the event of injury, the local MSCs traverse the shortest possible distance from the tissue or blood vessels to reach the affected site. But, there are few undifferentiated cells in the tissues. The exogenous MSCs are used to immunity modify or regenerative treatments in preclinical models of acute pulmonary diseases. Several studies have shown the positive effects of MSCs replacement in the acute lung disorders. The effection mechanism of the MSCs include the differentiation ability and the secretion of paracrine agents such as the anti-inflammatory mediators. Many studies suggest that this treatment method is safe and is probably to be widely used in future clinical trials. This review will describe the therapeutic effects of the MSCs in the experimental models of the acute pulmonary diseases for use as a method of treatment in clinical trials in future.","Sadeghian Chaleshtori, Sirous; Mokhber Dezfouli, Mohammad Reza; Jabbari Fakhr, Massoumeh",Respir Res,432,26

(2) Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive observational design, conducting the study in two occupational insurance provider clinics with patients with nonspecific low back and neck pain during the study period. Clinical variables were the Fear Avoidance Questionnaire, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, Neck Disability Index, Numerical Pain Scale; sociodemographic variables were sex, age, occupational, educational level, sickness absence status, and duration in days of absence from work. Multiple logistic and linear regressions were used to explore the association between variables. (3) Results: Fear-avoidance behavior is related to sickness absence status (OR = 1.048, p = 0.007), and the physical activity dimension (OR = 1.098, p = 0.013) is more relevant than the work dimension (OR = 1.056, p = 0.028). The duration of sickness absence is related to higher values on the fear-avoidance behavior scale in its global dimension (b = 0.84, p = 0.003, r = 0.327), and the results of the physical activity dimension (B = 1.37, p = 0.035, r = 0.236) were more relevant than the work dimension (B = 1.21, p = 0.003, r = 0.324).

The role of the immune system in influencing the course and the outcome of meningitis has been studied but it is not yet completely understood. The aim of the research is to ascertain whether children who experienced ACNS infection had a normal immune system. METHODS: Patients under 18 years of age admitted at Bambino Gesù Children from January 2006 till June 2016 for meningitis were asked to participate to the follow-up study. The immune status was evaluated both clinically and by laboratory investigations. RESULTS: Most of the patients over 3 years at follow up had at least one immunological alteration at follow-up evaluation (74%). Considering ACNS infection etiology, certain pathogens were almost exclusive of patients affected by some immunological alteration, regardless of their age. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary results indicate that sub-clinical immunological defects may be associated to ACNS pediatric infections. Moreover, to the best of our knowledges, this is the first study correlating pathogens to immune evaluation in ACNS infections. It is, however, important to underline the high frequency of persistent immunological alterations in the analyzed patients. Further studies are needed to confirm our conclusions.

It is also established that upon activation, metabolic pathways undergo shifts at the cellular level. However, most studies exploring these issues at the systemic or cellular level have utilized pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that model sepsis, or model antigens at isolated time points. Thus, the dynamics of pathogenesis and immune response to a live infection remain largely undocumented. To better quantitate the metabolic demands induced by infection, we utilized a live pathogenic infection model. Mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes were monitored longitudinally over the course of infection through clearance. We measured systemic metabolic phenotype, bacterial load, innate and adaptive immune responses, and cellular metabolic pathways. To further delineate the role of adaptive immunity in the metabolic phenotype, we utilized two doses of bacteria, one that induced both sickness behavior and protective (T cell mediated) immunity, and the other protective immunity alone. We determined that the greatest impact to systemic metabolism occurred during the early immune response, which coincided with the greatest shift in innate cellular metabolism. In contrast, during the time of maximal T cell expansion, systemic metabolism returned to resting state. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the timing of maximal metabolic demand overlaps with the innate immune response and that when the adaptive response is maximal, the host has returned to relative metabolic homeostasis.","Johnson, Robert M.; Olatunde, Adesola C.; Woodie, Lauren N.; Greene, Michael W.; Schwartz, Elizabeth Hiltbold",Front Immunol,432,16

While TS frequently causes high-output heart failure, low-output heart failure related to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is extremely rare. Tachycardia is a common clinical presentation of TS, and β1-selective blockers are the first-line agents for treating TS-associated tachycardia. However, given that β-blockers have negative chronotropic and negative inotropic effects, amiodarone may be safe and effective for the treatment of TS-induced tachyarrhythmia in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. While long-term amiodarone administration causes hypothyroidism, or less frequently, hyperthyroidism, little is known about the effects of short-term amiodarone administration on thyroid function. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old healthy woman presented with worsening dyspnoea. She was tachycardic with multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) of 184 beats/min, confirmed by electrocardiogram. Echocardiographic findings were consistent with DCM, with an ejection fraction of 20%. Thus, she was initially diagnosed with acute heart failure due to DCM with coexistent MAT. Tachycardia persisted despite cardioversion attempts and treatment with multiple anti-arrhythmic drugs. Consequently, she rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock and respiratory decompensation, which required intubation and an intra-aortic balloon pump support. Moreover, the undiagnosed Graves' disease, lack of suspicion, and postponed analysis of thyroid function tests led to a delayed diagnosis of TS. Amiodarone, which was initiated for MAT, unexpectedly ameliorated thyrotoxicosis, resulting in a euthyroid state and the patient’s significantly improved condition and cardiac function. She was discharged on day 40. Finally, she underwent total thyroidectomy; thyroid pathology was consisting with Graves' disease. Her postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe a case of delayed diagnosis of dilated thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy with coexistent MAT. The patient required intensive care due to the catastrophic sequelae and was successfully treated with amiodarone. This is the first case report of TS-associated MAT and highlights the clinical importance of high suspicion of TS in de novo heart failure with any tachyarrhythmia or DCM of unknown etiology and the potential effects of short-term amiodarone administration in the treatment of TS.","Yamamoto, Hiroyuki; Monno, Satoshi; Ohta-Ogo, Keiko; Ishibashi-Ueda, Hatsue; Hashimoto, Toru",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,432,12

Therefore, we evaluated the AMR features and resistance mechanisms of the ESKAPEE pathogens collected in a tertiary hospital located in the capital of Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 378 AMR-ESKAPEE strains were obtained based on convenience sampling over a nine-month study period (2019–2020). All strains were subjected to disk diffusion and broth microdilution assays to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analyses were performed to determine the AMR genes profiles of the non-susceptible strains. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were used to correlate the AMR profiles and clinical data to determine the risk factors associated with HAIs. RESULTS: High rates of multidrug resistance (MDR) were observed in A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. aureus (69–89%). All organisms except E. coli were frequently associated with HAIs (61–94%). Non-susceptibility to the last-resort drugs vancomycin (in Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus), carbapenems (in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae), and colistin (in Enterobacteriaceae) were observed. Both A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae harbored a wide array of extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(OXA)). Metallo-β-lactamase genes (bla(VEB), bla(VIM), bla(NDM)) were detected in carbapenem-resistant strains, at a higher frequency compared to other local reports. We detected two novel mutations in the quinolone-resistant determining region of the gyrA in fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (Leu-102-Ala; Gly-105-Val). Microbial resistance to ampicillin, methicillin, and cephalosporins was identified as important risk factors associated with HAIs in the hospital. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings may provide valuable insight into the microbial resistance pattern and the risk factors of ESKAPEE-associated HAIs in a tertiary hospital located in central Peninsular Malaysia. The data obtained in this study may contribute to informing better hospital infection control in this region.

Polish haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) isolates are usually low pathogenic and trigger a subclinical disease. Unfortunately, even the low- pathogenic HEV strains cause severe immunosuppression leading to secondary bacterial infections and huge economic losses. The objective of this study was to evaluate if the influence of Met on HEV infected turkeys immune response can be differentiated by both its level and source. Met is one of the amino acids that not only play a nutritional role but also participate in and regulate key metabolic pathways and immune response. In our study, the birds were assigned to 4 dietary treatments which differed in Met levels (0.55 and 0.78% in weeks 1–4 of age and 0.45 and 0.65% in weeks 5–8 of age, respectively) and sources (DL-methionine (DLM) or DL-methionine hydroxy analogue (MHA)). RESULTS: The HEV added the percentage of CD4(+) cells and decreased the percentage of IgM(+) cells in the blood, spleen and caecal tonsils (CTs) of turkeys. In addition, it increased the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells in blood, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) level in plasma. The higher dose of Met led to a significant decrease in the percentages of CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD4(+)IL-6(+) cell subpopulations in the blood of HEV-infected and uninfected turkeys and to an increase in the percentage of IgM(+) B cells in CTs. Turkeys administered feeds with an increased Met content displayed a decrease in plasma IL-6 levels and an increase in plasma IgA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that HEV infection impairs the immune function in turkeys. Met content in the feed has a moderate effect on the immune response in HEV-infected turkeys. The source of this amino acid appears not be as important as its dose, because value of the analysed parameters did not differ significantly between turkeys receiving feeds with DLM or MHA. In the uninfected turkeys, the higher by 40% (than recommended by NRC) level of Met in the feeds had a positive effect on humoral immunity parameters.","Tykałowski, Bartłomiej; Śmiałek, Marcin; Koncicki, Andrzej; Ognik, Katarzyna; Zduńczyk, Zenon; Jankowski, Jan",BMC Vet Res,432,1

Until recently, SFTSV-associated re-infection have not been reported and investigated. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old female patient was identified as a case of SFTS with re-infection, with two episodes of SFTSV infection on June 2018 and May 2020. The diagnosis of SFTS was confirmed by detection of SFTSV RNA in the blood samples using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and antibodies specific for SFTSV using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The changes of viremia and antibody response differed between the two episodes. Phylogenetic analysis showed the two viral genome sequences were in the same clade, but showing 0.6% dissimilarity of the nearly whole nucleotide sequence. Analysis of clinical data revealed that the second episode showed milder illness than that of the first episode. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological and clinical findings, viral whole genomic sequences, and serological evidence, provided evidence for the re-infection of SFTSV rather than prolonged viral shedding or relapse of the original infection. The patients with re-infection of SFTSV may be at high odds of clinically inapparent or mildly symptomatic. More attention should be directed towards the long-term follow up of the recovered patients in the future, to explicitly acquire the decay profile of their immunity response.

Further, three degradation modes were designed for (1) the collaborative behavior of opinion leaders, (2) main knowledge dissemination behavior, and (3) main knowledge contribution behavior. Regarding the degradation model of the collaborative behavior of opinion leaders, we considered the propagation characteristics of opinion leaders to other nodes, and we created a susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) propagation model of the influence of opinion leaders’ behaviors. Finally, based on empirical data from the Local Motors open-source vehicle design community, a dynamic robustness analysis experiment was carried out. The results showed that the robustness of our constructed network varied for different degradation modes: the degradation of the opinion leaders’ collaborative behavior had the lowest robustness; this was followed by the main knowledge dissemination behavior and the main knowledge contribution behavior; the degradation of random behavior had the highest robustness.

We extend the traditional SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) mathematical model and propose an Agent-based model to analyze the interactions between the host and the vector using: (i) our proposed algorithm to compute vector density, based on the reproductive behavior of the vector; and (ii) agent interactions to simulate transmission of virus in a spatio-temporal environment, and forecast the spread of the disease in a given area over a period of time. Our simulation results identify several expected dengue cases and their direction of spread, which can help in detecting epidemic outbreaks. Our proposed framework provides visualization and forecasting capabilities to study the epidemiology of a certain region and aid public health departments in emergency preparedness.","Mahmood, Imran; Jahan, Mishal; Groen, Derek; Javed, Aneela; Shafait, Faisal",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,432,21

Examples that help highlight the rising prominence of the regions as the most potential areas are also considered. This review's findings indicate that East and Southeast Asia have gradually built up their reputation by actively joining the designing, processing, and distributing digital products system.

It is evident that more experimental work is required; however, PARP14 appears vital in controlling the interferon response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and has potential roles in balancing the proinflammatory cytokines of the cytokine storm. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain can prevent the PARP14-mediated antiviral response, suggesting a more complex relationship between PARP14 activity and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Tauber, Amanda L; Schweiker, Stephanie S; Levonis, Stephan M",,432,33

Over time, the viral genome has accumulated mutations as it passes through its human hosts, a common evolutionary mechanism found in all microorganisms. This has implications for disease surveillance and management, vaccines and therapeutics, and the emergence of reinfections. Sequencing the viral genome can help monitor these changes and provides an extraordinary opportunity to understand the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the virus as well as tracking its spread in a population.

In the most affected developing countries diabetes has to be brought up very high on the political agenda, otherwise it would not be possible to provide the required resources to implement nationwide policies. Unfortunately, many countries spend most of their healthcare resources on treating diabetes complications, and not on prevention. Education on healthy nutrition for the general population has to start as early as possible. Tax on sweetened beverages and ‘junk food’ could be considered in developing countries. Physical activity should be encouraged for all ages and has to be a mandatory part of the formal education across all levels. Data on calories intake and physical activity should be recorded in the individual EHRs for monitoring of modifiable risk factors for diabetes. Comprehensive national programs of smoking cessations have to be in place, as smoking has been identified as a risk factor for diabetes and CVDs. Continuity is necessary for implementation of diabetes prevention initiatives as the results are not immediately visible. One of the challenges for developing countries is the lack of continuity of nationwide initiatives when there is change of political leadership.","Smokovski, Ivica",Managing Diabetes in Low Income Countries,432,1

We sought to describe our center’s experience with implementation of a psychological distress screening program in the run-up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We undertook an analysis of de-identified data as part of a quality improvement review focusing on the results of psychological screening of our outpatient burn population. In the spring of 2019, our verified burn center implemented an outpatient screening program consisting of a registered nurse administering three validated test to screen for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder screen, depression and anxiety, and problematic alcohol consumption to all patients at the time of physically checking in for their first burn clinic appointment. All outpatients triggering a positive screen are subsequently referred to the burn unit PsyD while a negative screen results in monthly repeat screenings until discharge from the burn clinic or a positive screen, whichever comes first. We analyzed data from the last twelve months of normal outpatient workflow. Loess regression was used to analyze the monthly proportions of patients screening positive. RESULTS: During the peak of COVID-19 in our region, clinic staff were reduced, and screening procedures suspended for the months of March and April 2020. Therefore, the study period consisted of 01 July 2019 to 31 August 2020. A median of 36.5 screens were conducted per month [interquartile range 27.75, 44.75]. Of these screens, 26.5% were positive, with 94.2% successfully referred to the burn unit’s postdoctoral fellow. The Loess regression showed the proportion of patients screening positive for psychological stressors from July 2019 until a peak in November 2019. A downtrend was then noted in the proportion screening positive from December 2019 to date (Figure). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological stressors are prevalent in burn outpatients. We attribute the decrease in positive responses beginning in December 2019 to a combination of a decrease in the frequency of repeat administrations of the screening test in patients after screening positive, and a reluctance of anxious patients to present to the burn clinic for fear of COVID exposure while at the facility.

Further characterisation is required to reduce both short and long-term adverse outcomes. METHODS: We examined registry data including adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to five London Hospitals from 1(st) January to 14th May 2020. Prior end-stage kidney disease was excluded. Early AKI was defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria within 7 days of admission. Independent associations of AKI and survival were examined in multivariable analysis. Results are given as odds ratios (OR), or hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Amongst 1855 admissions, 453 patients (24.5%) developed early AKI: 220 (44.0%) stage 1, 90 (19.8%) stage 2, 165 (36.3%) stage 3 (74 receiving renal replacement therapy). The strongest risk factor for AKI was high CRP (OR 3.35 [2.53-4.47], p < 0.001). Death within 30 days occurred in 242 (53.2%) with AKI compared to 255 (18.2%) without. In multivariable analysis, increasing severity of AKI was incrementally associated with higher mortality: stage 3 (HR 3.93 [3.04-5.08], p < 0.001). In 333 patients with AKI surviving to day 7, 134 (40.2%) recovered, 47 (14.1%) recovered then relapsed, and 152 (45.6%) had persistent AKI at day 7; an additional 105 (8.2%) patients developed AKI after day 7. Persistent AKI was strongly associated with adjusted mortality at 90-days (OR 7.57 [4.50-12.89], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AKI affected one in four hospital in-patients with COVID-19 and significantly increased mortality. Timing and recovery of COVID-19 AKI is a key determinant of outcome.","Wan, Yize I; Bien, Zuzanna; Apea, Vanessa J; Orkin, Chloe M; Dhairyawan, Rageshri; Kirwan, Christopher J; Pearse, Rupert M; Puthucheary, Zudin A; Prowle, John R",Clin Kidney J,432,1

However functioning gonadotroph adenomas are rare with only a few cases reported in literature. Clinical Case: A 42-year old man was admitted as a case of COVID-19 when an incidental finding of a pituitary gland mass was detected. Upon evaluation, the patient was found to have blurred vision and dizziness since few years, however no history of headache, seizures, visual field deficit were reported, nor clear symptoms related to anterior pituitary hypo- or hyperfunction. Pituitary MRI revealed a pituitary gland mass measuring 30x23x22 mm expanding the pituitary fossa and extending to suprasellar cistern. Initial laboratory investigations revealed low free T3 (1.8 pmol/L, normal: 3.1-6.8 pmol/L) and low free T4 (6.6 pmol/L, normal: 12-22 pmol/L) with normal TSH (3.54 mIU/L, normal: 0.27-4.2 mIU/L), high FSH (31.4 IU/L, normal: 1-18 IU/L), and high total testosterone (50.31 nmol/L, normal 8.3-32.9 nmol/L). Testicular ultrasound showed bilateral enlarged testicles (right testis 38.14 cm(3) and left testis 33.38 cm(3)). Visual Field testing revealed monocular superior temporal defect affecting only the left eye. Patient was treated medically with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone and surgically by minimally invasive transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma. Histopathology assessment confirmed the diagnosis of gonadotroph secreting adenoma, with positive immunostain for FSH. At 6 weeks postoperatively, insulin tolerance test was performed after which hydrocortisone was only prescribed during periods of stress. Anterior pituitary profile was repeated which revealed normalization of free T4 (14.3 pmol/L) and FSH (1.2 IU/L) and decrease in testosterone (0.66 nmol/L). Assessment of visual field revealed marked improvement of previous findings. Pituitary MRI was also repeated with findings of enhancing soft tissue remnants. At 12 weeks postoperatively, anterior pituitary profile revealed normalization of testosterone (11.3 nmol/L). Testicular ultrasound was repeated and showed a marked decrease in testicular volume (right testis 17.93 cm(3) and left testis 21.13 cm(3)). Conclusion: Functional gonadotroph adenomas are a rare subtype of pituitary adenomas which pose a diagnostic challenge and require meticulous clinical evaluation and multidisciplinary therapeutic approach.","AlNasrallah, Noor; Almurshed, Maryam; Aljenaee, Khaled; Hajji, Sulaiman",J Endocr Soc,432,24

New guidance recommends all patients admitted acutely to hospital should have a HACP completed within 24 hours. We aimed to assess how many orthopaedic trauma patients admitted to the study centre had HACP completed within 24 hours of admission. METHOD: Departmental Quality Improvement Project (QIP) permission was granted, and standard audit protocol was utilised. Data were collected in a retrospective manner using our trauma database and online patient record system. Educational interventions including staff teaching sessions and dissemination of infographic posters were implemented. Cycle two was repeated in similar fashion. RESULTS: Cycle one (50 patients): 37/50(74%) had HACPs completed. Of those with HACPs, 18/37(49%) were completed within 24 hours. Median time to completion was 45.3 hours (range 0.4-275.1 hours).

However, how sleep interacts with the pandemic on affecting EF remains unclear, particularly among late adolescents and young adults. This study examined (1) the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep and EF and (2) whether sleep moderated pandemic-related changes in EF among young people aged 18-21 years old. METHODS: Between April and May 2020, university students with baseline data on sleep and EF (Spring and Fall semesters in 2019) available were invited to this follow-up study. Sleep duration, mid-sleep times, social jetlag (the difference between mid-sleep times on weekdays and weekends) and sleep latency were assessed using 7-day sleep diaries. Participants also completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive function which yielded Global Executive Composite (GEC) scores. Paired t-test and multilevel random-effects models (STATA 16.0) estimated the associations. Covariates in multilevel models included age, sex, race, family income, parental education, COVID status, and health behaviors. RESULTS: Forty participants (19.25±1.12 years old) had paired data before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants slept 24 min longer (t= -2.07, p=0.03) but had increased sleep latency (t=-1.83, p=0.07) during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID baseline. Mid-sleep times shifted 40 min later (t= -3.22, p=0.003) during the pandemic. In multilevel models, GEC scores increased during pandemic (b=3.15, p=0.03) versus baseline, suggesting decreased executive function. Sleep duration (β=-4.72, p=0.03) significantly interacted with assessment time (before/during COVID-19), with increasing sleep duration attenuating the decline in EF during pandemic versus baseline. Although there was no interaction with COVID-19 pandemic, poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) was independently associated with decreased EF (B=4.69, p=0.02). Other sleep variables were not associated with EF nor moderators. CONCLUSION: Compared with pre-COVID-19 baseline, young people report longer sleep duration, later sleep phase, increased sleep latency, and worse executive function during the pandemic. Sufficient sleep represents a resilience factor against executive function decline during this unprecedented crisis. SUPPORT (IF ANY): No","Ji, Xiaopeng; Saylor, Jennifer",Sleep,432,24

Main funding source(s): This research was funded by the Ministry of Health, Czech Republic; conceptual development of research organization (FNBr, 65269705). BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, causing COVID-19, has been affected worldwide. During the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care provision was significantly reduced or interrupted as a precaution. In particular quarantine and social isolation, public health preventive measures of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have been found to be associated with worsening cardiovascular risk factors. CR exercise programs have also been affected by these restrictions"" effects, and stress testing was attenuated due to concerns about the spread of the disease through the potential transfer of aerosol particles. Therefore, in many centers or specialized clinics, CR programs have been partially interrupted. PURPOSE: The purpose of our research was to propose the possibility of an alternative approach, namely remotely monitored CR, which takes into account the recommendations for COVID-19 quarantine in cardiac patients. We assumed that through the remotely monitored CR based on a walking test, we would conduct an effective alternative intervention to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. METHODS: From October to December 2020, we performed an 8-week study of remotely monitored CR in cardiac patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk. The intervention was based on the principles of II. phase of CR and consisted of regular physical exercise and teleconsultations in the home-based setting. Patients were instructed to perform regular physical exercise 3 - 5 times a week, for a minimum of 30 minutes, to control the intensity on an HR monitor at the target zone determined by calculation based on the 200-meter fast-walk test (200MFWT) result. Besides, patients were instructed that the physical exercise intensity was consistent with the rate of perceived exertion rating between ""somewhat hard"" to ""hard"" (12 - 14). The study physiotherapist was a remote trainer who telemonitored patients and gave them telephone feedback once every two weeks. RESULTS: The study completed ten patients. All patients were post-cardiac revascularization with recommended medication, including beta-blockers. The average age was 60.5 ± 8.8 years. The statistical analysis showed significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness by reducing the 200MFWT time from 116.8 ± 7.2 seconds to 105.0 ± 5.8 seconds (p = 0.005). The above performance improvement was achieved without a statistically significant change in HRmax at the end of 200MFW. No physical activity-related adverse events were reported throughout the intervention. Conclusion(s): Our study supports the effectiveness of remotely monitored CR, which can address limited access during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research evidence suggests that CR based on a walking test and telemonitoring via an HR monitor can effectively increase cardiorespiratory fitness in cardiac patients with low to moderate cardiovascular risk.","Batalik, L; Dosbaba, F; Konecny, V; Batalikova, K",Eur J Prev Cardiol,432,24

Information about the impact of infection on glomerular disease patients in particular has been lacking. Understanding the virus's effect in glomerular disease is constantly changing. This review article summarizes the data published thus far on COVID-19 and its manifestations in pre-existing and de novo glomerular disease. SUMMARY: While patients with glomerular disease may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 due to their immunosuppressed status, some data suggest that a low amount of immunosuppression may be helpful in mitigating the systemic inflammatory response which is associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19. There have been a few case reports on COVID-19 causing glomerular disease relapse in patients. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for kidney injury, proteinuria, and hematuria in the setting of COVID-19. More commonly, these are caused by direct tubular injury due to hemodynamic instability and hypoxic injury. However, the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 may trigger common post-viral glomerular disease such as IgA nephropathy, anti-GBM, and ANCA vasculitis that have also been described in COVID-19 patients. Collapsing glomerulopathy, a hallmark of HIV-associated nephropathy, is being reported SARS-CoV-2 cases, particularly in patients with high-risk APOL1 alleles. Direct viral invasion of glomerular structures is hypothesized to cause a podocytopathy due to virus's affinity to ACE2, but evidence for this remains under study. KEY MESSAGES: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause glomerular disease in certain patients. The mechanism of de novo glomerular disease in the setting of COVID-19 is under study. The management of patients with existing glomerular disease poses unique challenges, especially with regard to immunosuppression management. Further studies are needed to inform clinician decisions about the management of these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shimmel, Allison; Shaikhouni, Salma; Mariani, Laura",Glomerular Dis,432,0

False news has taken over social media, becoming part of life for many people. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate, through a systematic review, the impact of social media on the dissemination of infodemic knowing and its impacts on health. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the MedLine, Virtual Health Library (VHL), and Scielo databases from January 1, 2020, to May 11, 2021. Studies that addressed the impact of fake news on patients and healthcare professionals around the world were included. It was possible to methodologically assess the quality of the selected studies using the Loney and Newcastle–Ottawa Scales. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were eligible for inclusion, consisting of six cross-sectional and eight descriptive observational studies. Through questionnaires, five studies included measures of anxiety or psychological distress caused by misinformation; another seven assessed feeling fear, uncertainty, and panic, in addition to attacks on health professionals and people of Asian origin. CONCLUSION: By analyzing the phenomenon of fake news in health, it was possible to observe that infodemic knowledge can cause psychological disorders and panic, fear, depression, and fatigue.","Rocha, Yasmim Mendes; de Moura, Gabriel Acácio; Desidério, Gabriel Alves; de Oliveira, Carlos Henrique; Lourenço, Francisco Dantas; de Figueiredo Nicolete, Larissa Deadame",Z Gesundh Wiss,432,20

This shift likely impacted congregational finances, which are primarily driven by individual donations. Initial research has suggested that there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the financial impact on congregations, but there has been scant research examining how pastors and congregations are managing finances during this period. PURPOSE: This research examines the impact of COVID-19 and its associated restrictions on congregational finances and the strategies pastors used to adapt their church’s finances to the health restrictions. METHODS: We conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews with 50 pastors in the North Carolina and Western North Carolina Conferences of the United Methodist Church appointed to 70 congregations. Using applied thematic analysis, we analyzed transcripts at both the pastor and congregation-level to identify similarities and differences in financial impact, financial strategies, and pastor experiences during the pandemic. RESULTS: Most congregations reported small decreases in giving that were offset by federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and other grants from the denomination. Some congregations, mostly urban and fairly large, reported significant increases in giving, while several other, predominantly small congregations, reported their church’s finances had been negatively impacted by the pandemic. Even in cases where the net impact of the pandemic was small or non-existent, pastors were forced to adopt a host of new strategies to manage finances. In general, small and large congregations experienced and responded to the financial impact of the pandemic very differently.and Implications. CONCLUSIONS: This research suggests that the pandemic’s impact on congregational finances were more than just on the bottom line. And while most churches weathered the economic challenges without severe impacts, questions remain as to the long-term impact of the pandemic on church finances.

In 2017, the authors implemented a multi-disciplinary surgical team comprising gynecologic oncologists as well as colorectal, hepatobiliary, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgeons to increase gross macroscopic resection rates. This report aims to describe changes in complete cytoreduction rates and morbidity after the implementation of a multi-disciplinary surgical team comprising gynecologic oncologists as well as colorectal, hepatobiliary, and upper GI surgeons in a tertiary gynecologic oncology unit. METHODS The study used two cohorts. Cohort A was a retrospectively collated cohort from 2006 to 2015. Cohort B was a prospectively collated cohort of patients initiated in 2017. A multidisciplinary approach to preoperative medical optimization, intraoperative management, and postoperative care was implemented in 2017. The patients in cohort B with upper abdominal disease were offered primary cytoreduction with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Before 2017, the patients with upper abdominal disease received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cohort A). RESULTS This study included 146 patients in cohort A (2006-2015) and 93 patients in cohort B (2017-2019) with stages 3 or 4 ovarian cancer. The overall complete macroscopic resection rate (CC0) increased from 58.9 in cohort A to 67.7% in cohort B. The rate of primary cytoreductive surgery (CRS) increased from 38 (55/146) in cohort A to 42% (39/93) in cohort B. The CC0 rate for the patients who underwent primary CRS increased from 49 in cohort A to 77% in cohort B. Major morbidity remained stable throughout both study periods (2006-2019). CONCLUSIONS The study data demonstrate that implementation of a multidisciplinary team intraoperative approach and a meticulous approach to preoperative optimization resulted in significantly improved complete resection rates, particularly for women offered primary CRS.","Mulligan, Karen M; Glennon, Kate; Donohoe, Fionán; O'Brien, Yvonne; Mc Donnell, Brian C; Bartels, Helena C; Vermeulen, Carolien; Walsh, Tom; Shields, Conor; McCormack, Orla; Conneely, John; Boyd, William D; Mc Vey, Ruaidhrí; Mulsow, Jurgen; Brennan, Donal J",Annals of surgical oncology,432,5

As the first nation to respond, China's aggressive control measures appeared to have been effective in suppressing the first wave and keeping new cases under control. Here, we provide the historical context and details of China's public health response to COVID-19. We highlight the lessons and impact of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which demonstrated the importance of transparency, surveillance and testing laboratories during an outbreak. We provide an overview of China's response strategy that was based on the principles of early detection, isolation, management and treatment and involved not only the large-scale coordination of multiple governmental bodies but also grass-root community participation throughout the country. These community-based organizations conducted active surveillance for febrile cases and provided support for those in quarantine and communities in lockdown. Importantly, these broader measures were supported by digital technology, including the extensive use of internet-based platforms and mobile applications (APPs). While there have been no significant increases in case numbers since April, there is still much concern over a second wave, considering the resumption of work and school, the lifting of travel restrictions and the outbreaks occurring globally. Control measures has since been implemented by provincial authorities, which includes continued surveillance and rapid testing. Although China's strict control measures may not suit every nation, the principles of early detection and isolation continue to hold true and have been a cornerstone of the initial and ongoing response to the COVID-19.","Zanin, Mark; Xiao, Cheng; Liang, Tingting; Ling, Shiman; Zhao, Fengming; Huang, Zhenting; Lin, Fangmei; Lin, Xia; Jiang, Zhanpeng; Wong, Sook-San",Journal of thoracic disease,432,29

The potential of anaerobic digestion (AD) to remove antibiotics and ARGs was investigated through tetracycline (TC) and sulfadimethoxine (SDM) additions into dairy manure digested for 44 d. This was the first study to evaluate antibiotics at concentrations quantified on-farm and relevant to field applications of manure. Triplicate treatments included a 1 mg L-1 TC spike, a 10 mg L-1 TC spike, a 1 mg L-1 SDM spike (SDM 1), a 10 mg L-1 SDM spike, a mixture of TC and SDM at 1 mg L-1 each (TC+SDM 1), and a manure-only treatment. The SDM spikes were reduced by >99% reduction during the AD processing, but TC additions had variable reductions (0-96%). Molecular analyses showed that decreases in tetM gene copies correlated with declines in TC; however, reductions in SDM concentration did not correlate with decreases in sul1 gene copy concentrations. The AD reactors containing 10 mg L-1 of TC and 10 mg L-1 of SDM both had CH4 production reductions of 7.8%, whereas no CH4 reduction was observed in other treatments (1 mg L-1 treatments). The study results were the first to confirm that AD can remove SDM when adding at concentrations observed in on-farm manure (<1 mg L-1 ) without compromising energy production. Because TC adsorbs to the solid particles and transforms into isomers, the decreases in TC concentrations were more variable and should be closely monitored.","Schueler, Jenna; Lansing, Stephanie; Crossette, Emily; Naas, Kayla; Hurst, Jerod; Raskin, Lutgarde; Wigginton, Krista; Aga, Diana S",Journal of environmental quality,432,16

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess work stress and associated factors among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and to evaluate whether prior experience of treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a positive or negative influence on healthcare workers' stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional survey in a tertiary hospital in Kaohsiung City, in southern Taiwan. METHODS The survey was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire to measure the stress levels among healthcare workers from March 20 to April 20, 2020. The stress scales were divided into four subscales: worry of social isolation; discomfort caused by the protective equipment; difficulties and anxiety regarding infection control; and workload of caring for patients. RESULTS The total stress scores were significantly higher among healthcare workers who were aged 41 or above, female, married, parents and nurses. Those with experience of treating SARS reported having significantly higher stress scores on the subscale measuring the discomfort caused by protective equipment and the workload of caring for patients. During the COVID-19 outbreak, frontline healthcare workers with experience of treating SARS indicated having higher stress levels regarding the workload of caring for patients than did non-frontline healthcare workers with no experience of treating SARS. CONCLUSIONS Work experience from dealing with the 2003 SARS virus may have had a negative psychological impact on healthcare workers amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chen, Chun-Hsien; Yang, Pei-Hsuan; Kuo, Fang-Li; Yeh, I-Jeng; Su, Che-Yu",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,432,5

We undertook this study to evaluate and compare cost of care and reimbursement with robotic versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS AND PROCEDURES The charges and reimbursement of all robotic and laparoscopic cholecystectomies at one hospital undertaken from June 2012 to June 2013 were determined. Operative duration is defined as time into and time out of the operating room. Data are presented as median data. Comparisons were undertaken using the Mann-Whitney U-test with significance accepted at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS Robotic cholecystectomy took longer (47 min longer) and had greater charges ($8,182.57 greater) than laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p < 0.05 for each). However, revenue, earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes (EBDIT), and Net Income were not impacted by approach. CONCLUSIONS Relative to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, robotic cholecystectomy takes longer and has greater charges. Revenue, EBDIT, and Net Income are similar after either approach; this indicates that costs with either approach are similar. Notably, this is possible because much of hospital-based costs are determined by cost allocation and not cost accounting. Thus, the cost of longer operations and costs inherent to the robotic approach for cholecystectomy do not translate to a perceived financial burden.","Rosemurgy, Alexander; Ryan, Carrie; Klein, Richard; Sukharamwala, Prashant; Wood, Thomas; Ross, Sharona",Surgical endoscopy,432,16

RESULTS 106 papers were included for analysis. The distributions of four parameters in two literature groups were close, and the timeliness of preprints was better. Synthesized estimates of the basic reproduction number (3.18, 95% CI 2.85-3.53), incubation period (5.44 days, 95% CI 4.98-5.99), infectious period (6.25 days, 95% CI 5.09-7.51), and case-fatality-rate (4.51%, 95% CI 3.41%-6.29%) were obtained. Simulated cumulative cases of SEIRDC model matched well with the onset cases in China. CONCLUSIONS The validity of the COVID-19 parameter estimations of the preprints was on par with that of peer-reviewed publications, and synthesized results of literatures could reduce the uncertainty and be used for epidemic decision making.","Wang, Yuejiao; Cao, Zhidong; Zeng, Daniel Dajun; Zhang, Qingpeng; Luo, Tianyi",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,432,33

We performed a retrospective analysis of outcomes for patients who underwent HSCT at our institution between 2009 and 2017 for BMFS using an irradiation-free RIC regimen. Fourteen pediatric patients with BMFS received fludarabine (30 mg/m2 IV daily × 3), thiotepa (5 mg/kg IV every 12 hours × 2), and melphalan (70 mg/m2 IV daily × 2) prior to HSCT. Our cohort included the following diagnoses: SAA (n = 7), CAMT (n = 4), SCN (n = 1), DBA (n = 1), and non-Fanconi congenital BMF (n = 1). Seven patients underwent a MSD transplant; seven underwent an unrelated donor transplant. All patients are alive with median follow-up of 1112 days (range 455-2549 days). The median time to neutrophil engraftment was 16 days (range 10-26 days). All were transfusion independent by day + 100. The highest grade of aGVHD was grade 2; 8 (57%) did not develop aGVHD.

This study aimed to compare the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation (LIPUS) versus whole body vibration (WBV) on healing of mandibular bone defects. Materials and Methods: A mandibular defect was created in 66 rats. The rats were randomly divided into two groups of rats. Each group was subdivided randomly by three groups (n = 11) as follows: (I) control group, (II) treatment with LIPUS, and (III) treatment with WBV. The radiographic changes in bone density, the ratio of lamellar bone to the entire bone volume, the ratio of the newly formed bone to the connective tissue and inflammation grade were evaluated after 1 and 2 months. Results: LIPUS significantly increased the radiographic bone density change compared to the control group at the first and second month postoperatively (p < 0.01). WBV only significantly increased the bone density compared to the control group at the second month after the surgery (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Application of LIPUS and WBV may enhance the regeneration of mandibular bone defects in rats. Although LIPUS and WBV are effective in mandibular bone healing, the effects of LIPUS are faster and greater than WBV.","Etemadi Sh, Milad; Hsieh, Nan-Chen; Movahed Mohammadi, Seyed Shahin; Momeni, Shahrooz; Razavi, Seyed Mohammad; Alizargar, Javad",Medicina,432,1

The basic microwave system consists of the generator, power distribution system and antennas. Often under image (computed tomography or ultrasound) guidance, a needle-like antenna is inserted percutaneously into the tumor, where local microwave electromagnetic radiation is emitted from the probe's active tip, producing frictional tissue heating, capable of causing cell death by coagulation necrosis. Half of the microwave ablation systems use a 915 MHz generator and the other half use a 2450 MHz generator. To date, there are no completed clinical trials comparing microwave devices head-to-head. Prospective comparisons of microwave technology with other treatment alternatives, as well as head-to-head comparison with each microwave device, is needed if this promising field will garner more widespread support and use in the oncology community.","Ward, Robert C; Healey, Terrance T; Dupuy, Damian E",Expert review of medical devices,432,1

CASE PRESENTATION We report a complicated case of a symptomatic patient presenting with a type B aortic dissection and false lumen extension into superior mesenteric artery (SMA) with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Severe back pain and hypertension were the patient's initial complaints. This patient underwent endovascular repair with a thoracic and infrarenal aortic endograft. DISCUSSION AAA rupture has been detected at admission in three-fourths of patients with ATBAD that extended to or involved a coexisting unoperated atherosclerotic aneurysms. Prompt surgical intervention is essential to deal with this dreadful aortic emergency.

METHODS This randomized trial sought to evaluate the efficacy of albuterol lavage via artificial airway with accompanied patient positioning. Subjects receiving mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure with clinical manifestations of bronchoconstriction were assigned to initially receive either traditional albuterol via metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or albuterol via ELB lavage with follow-up administration of the other therapy after a 4-h washout period. Clinical data were collected at baseline and at 5 and 30 min post-treatment. RESULTS Fourteen subjects (5 males, 9 females; mean age of 57.5 y) were included in this study. In the group receiving initial ELB, peak airway pressure decreased significantly (P = .02), and a significant decrease in airway resistance mean scores was seen from baseline to 30 min post-treatment (P < .001) and from 5 to 30 min post-treatment (P = .003), with no significant effects seen with follow-up MDI. In the initial MDI treatment group, no significant effect on peak airway pressure or airway resistance was noted. S(pO2) increased at 5 min post-treatment with ELB. In contrast, S(pO2) decreased 30 min post-treatment with MDI. Mean arterial pressure decreased post-treatment with ELB. The pattern in heart rate change post-treatment with ELB was similar to that post-treatment with MDI, with a significant increase at the 5-min interval from baseline (P < .01), followed by a significant decrease at the 30-min interval (P < .001). There were no differences in dynamic compliance at each time interval following administration of both the MDI (P = .92) and ELB conditions (P = .18). CONCLUSIONS ELB albuterol lavage may be a viable option to reverse bronchoconstriction in intubated patients with limited response to traditional aerosolized albuterol via MDI.","Johnston, Donald A; Gilmore, Tim W; Gosselin, Kevin P",Respiratory care,432,26

In this prospective cohort, we investigated the performance of the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) and a visual analog scale (VAS) for abdominal pain as outcome measures in Crohn's disease. METHODS Patients with active Crohn's disease starting glucocorticoids or anti-tumor necrosis factor were included. Before treatment and 10 weeks later we collected: clinical activity [Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) and Crohn's-Disease-Activity-Index (CDAI)], serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin, and BSFS (1-7) and a 100-mm VAS based on a 7-day diary. Clinical response was defined as a reduction by at least 3 and at least 100 of HBI and CDAI, respectively. Fecal calprotectin-response and CRP-response were defined as reduction of at least 50%. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients completed follow-up. At baseline, BSFS-parameters correlated more strongly with clinical activity (range: rs: 0.31-0.74) than with CRP (rs: -0.01 to 0.16) and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.14-0.26). VAS scores correlated very weakly to moderately with clinical activity (rs: 0.18-0.45), and weakly to moderately with CRP (rs: 0.24-0.34) and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.35-0.43). Changes in VAS scores correlated moderately to strongly (rs: 0.55-0.71) with changes in clinical activity, and weakly with changes in CRP and fecal calprotectin (rs: 0.21-0.35). Changes in BSFS parameters correlated weakly to moderately (rs: 0.23-0.53) with changes in clinical activity, and very weakly to weakly (rs: 0.01-0.35) with changes in CRP and fecal calprotectin. Responsiveness of VAS and BSFS was moderate to high (Guyatt's statistic 0.41-2.17) and highly dependent on the definition of response. CONCLUSIONS The BSFS and a VAS appear to be responsive with moderate-to-strong construct validity to monitor patients with Crohn's disease.","Hoekman, Daniël R; Löwenberg, Mark; van den Brink, Gijs R; Ponsioen, Cyriel Y; Benninga, Marc A; D'Haens, Geert R",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,432,1

Research Method/Design: A cross-sectional survey design was implemented. The total number of participants were 269 individuals with self-reported disabilities and chronic conditions (Mage = 39.37, SDage = 12.18). We examined the relationship between perceived stress and coping strategies related to COVID-19, and which COVID-19 coping strategies were associated with well-being after controlling for demographic and psychological characteristics. RESULTS Correlation analyses demonstrated that perceived stress related to COVID-19 was positively associated with coping strategies including self-distraction, denial, substance use, behavioral disengagement, venting, planning, religion, and self-blame. Further, hierarchical regression results demonstrated that active coping, denial, use of emotional support, humor, religion, and self-blame were associated with participants' well-being after controlling for demographic and psychological characteristics. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS This exploratory study findings suggest that measuring and quantifying COVID-19 related stress and coping strategies in individuals with chronic conditions and disabilities can help clinicians and researchers understand potential effects of COVID-19 among people with chronic conditions and disabilities.

OBJECTIVES Prior work has demonstrated that ETco2 is lower in patients with PAH than in control patients, but whether ETco2 has prognostic value is unknown. We hypothesized that lower measurements of ETco2 in patients with PAH correlate with worse long-term outcomes. METHODS Patients with PAH seen in our referral clinic were prospectively recruited for ETco2 measurement between September 2009 and February 2010. Vital status as of July 2015 was documented using medical records and the Social Security Death Index. RESULTS Eighty-two patients were followed for a median of 60 months. Twenty-six patients died, and two were lost to follow-up. Patients who died were more likely to be older (58.5 ± 14.9 vs. 47.6 ± 12.2 yr; P < 0.05) and to have shorter 6-minute walk distance (296 ± 127 vs. 401 ± 92 m; P < 0.05). Mean ETco2 in survivors was 30.5 ± 4.8 mm Hg, whereas mean ETco2 in patients who died was 27.1 ± 4.2 mm Hg (P = 0.004). After stratification by median baseline ETco2 of 29 mm Hg, survival in each group was analyzed. Patients with lower ETco2 had shorter survival (P = 0.006). Cox regression analysis with ETco2 as a continuous variable revealed the hazard ratio to be 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.97; P = 0.006). In 52 patients with more than one measurement a median of 17 months apart, ETco2 was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS Our single-center data suggest that lower ETco2 is associated with shorter survival and that ETco2 is stable over time in patients with PAH.","Welch, Caitlin E; Brittain, Evan L; Newman, Alexander L; Robbins, Ivan M; Pugh, Meredith E; Newman, John H; Hemnes, Anna R",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,432,7

Mapquesting the glaciers led to the discovery of concealed world of ""psychrophiles"" harboring in it. In the present study, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and heavy metal resistance genes (MRGs) were evaluated through both the culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Samples were collected from two different glaciers, i.e., debris-covered glacier (Changme Khangpu) and debris-free glacier (Changme Khang). Functional metagenomics of both the glacier samples, provided evidence of presence of resistant genes against various antibiotic groups. Bacitracin resistant gene (bacA) was the predominant ARG in both the glaciers. MRGs in both the glacier samples were diversified as the genes detected were resistant against various heavy metals such as arsenic, tungsten, mercury, zinc, chromium, copper, cobalt, and iron. Unique MRGs identified from Changme Khangpu glacier were resistant to copper (cutA, cutE, cutC, cutF, cueR, copC, and copB) and chromium (yelf, ruvB, nfsA, chrR, and chrA) whereas, from Changme Khang glacier they showed resistance against cobalt (mgtA, dmef, corD, corC, corB, and cnrA), and iron (yefD, yefC, yefB, and yefA) heavy metals. ARGs aligned maximum identity with Gram-negative psychrotolerant bacteria. The cultured bacterial isolates showed tolerance to high concentrations of tested heavy metal solutions. Interestingly, some of the antibiotic resistant bacterial isolates also showed tolerance towards the higher concentrations of heavy metals. Thus, an introspection of the hypothesis of co-occurrence and/co-selection of ARGs and MRGs in such environments has been highlighted here.","Sherpa, Mingma Thundu; Najar, Ishfaq Nabi; Das, Sayak; Thakur, Nagendra",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,432,16

METHODS After 8 min of untreated cardiac arrest, the animals were resuscitated either with active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR plus a sham ITD (control group, n=8) or with ACD-CPR plus an active ITD (ITD group, n=8). Adrenaline was administered every 4 min and electrical defibrillation was attempted every 2 min until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or asystole. After ROSC the animals were monitored for 6 h under general anesthesia and then returned to their cages for a 48 h observation, before euthanasia. Two novel biomarkers, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in plasma and Interleukin-18 (IL-18) in urine, were measured at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h post-ROSC, in order to assess the degree of AKI. RESULTS ROSC was observed in 7 (87.5%) animals treated with the sham valve and 8 (100%) animals treated with the active valve (P=NS). However, more than twice as many animals survived at 48 h in the ITD group (n=8, 100%) compared to the control group (n=3, 37.5%). Urine IL-18 and plasma NGAL levels were augmented post-ROSC in both groups, but they were significantly higher in the control group compared with the ITD group, at all measured time points.

Precise calculation of DNA loads in samples containing a wide range of viral amounts was allowed by generating a standard curve for absolute quantification. The assay was proven to be highly specific, since no cross-reactions with the different CAdV type was observed, and sensitive, being able to detect less than 10 copies of CAdV-1/CAdV-2 DNA. The low intra-assay and interassay coefficient of variations demonstrated a high repeatability, thus confirming the potential use of this assay for quantitative detection of CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 for rapid diagnosis and epidemiological investigations.","Dowgier, Giulia; Mari, Viviana; Losurdo, Michele; Larocca, Vittorio; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Cirone, Francesco; Lucente, Maria Stella; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio; Decaro, Nicola",Journal of virological methods,432,11

Patients and methods The current study was carried out at Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences, Jamshoro, Pakistan, in collaboration with National Institute of Blood Disease & Bone Marrow Transplant, Karachi, Pakistan, during the period from June 2019 to June 2020. A total of 130 patients diagnosed with AML were screened for TET2 mutations. Whole exome sequencing of 14 individuals was carried out to find the genetic variants in TET2 gene. The pathogenicity of the variants was predicted by SIFT, PolyPhen2, Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. The allele frequency of the variants was compared with global population using 1000 genomes project and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Furthermore, exon 3 and exon 5 of the TET2 gene were sequenced by using Sanger sequencing. The findings were correlated with subtypes of AML and corresponding karyotypes. Results Through the exome sequencing, 17 genetic variants (13 SNPs and four indels) were identified in 14 individuals. Of these, four variants that is, one frameshift deletion, one frameshift insertion and two nonsense variants were novel and not present in dbSNP151 database. Three novel variants were found in exon 3 including two frameshift variants that is, p.T395fs and G494fs, predicted as deleterious by CADD Phred scores, and one stop-gain variant (p.G898X) predicted as deleterious by Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. One novel non sense variant (p.Q1191X) was found in the exon 5 predicted as deleterious by SIFT, Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. Sanger sequencing analysis revealed one novel deletion at g105233851: del.TAGATAGA, and one novel SNP g;105233861 T>G identified in the TET2 gene. Majority of the exon 3 mutations were seen in the patients diagnosed with AML with maturation, and had a normal karyotype. Conclusion TET2 mutations were identified in around 16% of the total patients of our study indicating other mechanisms being involved in pathophysiology of AML in this cohort. The TET2 mutations provide a prognostic value in determining AML classification.","Shaikh, Abdul Rehman Khalil; Ujjan, Ikram; Irfan, Muhammad; Naz, Arshi; Shamsi, Tahir; Khan, Muhammad Tariq Masood; Shakeel, Muhammad",PeerJ,432,0

OBJECTIVE Describe the robotic and laparoscopic technique and the short-term outcomes of high extended pelvic LND (PLND) up to the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) during RC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From January 2007 through September 2009, we performed high extended PLND with proximal extent up to the IMA (n=10) or aortic bifurcation (n=5) in 15 patients undergoing robotic RC (n=4) or laparoscopic RC (n=11) at two institutions. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed robotic extended PLND with the proximal extent up to the IMA or aortic bifurcation. The LND was performed starting from the right external iliac, obturator, internal iliac, common iliac, preaortic and para-aortic, precaval, and presacral and then proceeding to the left side. The accompanying video highlights our detailed technique. MEASUREMENTS Median age was 69 yr, body mass index was 26, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥ 3 was present in 40% of patients. All urinary diversions, including orthotopic neobladder (n=5) and ileal conduit (n=10), were performed extracorporeally. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS All 15 procedures were technically successful without need for conversion to open surgery. Median operative time was 6.7h, estimated blood loss was 500 ml, and three patients (21%) required blood transfusion. Median nodal yield in the entire cohort was 31 (range: 15-78). The IMA group had more nodes retrieved (median: 42.5) compared with the aortic bifurcation group (median: 20.5). Histopathology confirmed nodal metastases in four patients (27%), including three patients in the IMA group and one patient in the aortic bifurcation group. Perioperative complications were recorded in six cases (40%). During a median follow-up of 13 mo, no patient developed local or systemic recurrence. Limitations of the study include its retrospective design and small cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS High extended PLND during laparoscopic or robotic RC is technically feasible. Longer survival data in a larger cohort of patients are necessary to determine the proper place for robotic and laparoscopic surgery in patients undergoing RC for high-risk bladder cancer.","Desai, Mihir M; Berger, Andre K; Brandina, Ricardo R; Zehnder, Pascal; Simmons, Matthew; Aron, Monish; Skinner, Eila C; Gill, Inderbir S",European urology,432,12

As a phenotype of atherosclerosis, carotid plaque and its influence factors are rarely discussed among dialysis patients. The study aimed to investigate the prognosis-predictive significance of carotid plaques in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and explore risks factors for carotid plaque-presence. METHODS It was an observational, prospective study. Patients that had undergone stable peritoneal dialysis for at least 3 months were recruited and divided into two subgroups: group with carotid plaques and group without carotid plaques. Cox regression model was used to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Pathogenic factors correlated to the plaque-occurrence were explored by logistic regression and verified by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS A total of 233 PD patients were recruited. The cohort was followed for up to 86 months. The carotid plaque-presence turned out to be an independent risk factor both of cardiovascular events (HR:2.659; 95%CI: 1.231-5.741; p=0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (HR:3.716; 95%CI: 1.168-11.823; p=0.026). The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) ratio was significantly associated with the presence of carotid plaques. ROC analysis indicated that the AUC of the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was higher than that of the traditional lipid metabolism index for detecting plaque-presence. CONCLUSIONS Carotid plaque-presence can predict cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality in PD patients. The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is significantly correlated to the carotid plaques and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio had a greater sensitivity than traditional lipid indices for predicting plaque presence.","Chen, Yun; Shang, Da; Shao, Jie; Dai, Shuqi; Ge, Xiaolin; Hao, Chuanming; Zhu, Tongying",Nephrology,432,1

Single-incision transumbilical laparoscopic liver resection (SITLLR) has been recently described in limited series. We report our experience in SITLLR and discuss the future of this approach in terms of indications, potential benefits, and limitations, with a special reference to laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). Patients and Methods. Six patients underwent SITLLR. Indications were biliary cysts (3 cases), hydatid cysts (2), and colorectal liver metastasis (1). Procedures consisted in cysts unroofing, left lateral lobectomy, pericystectomy, and wedge resection. SITLLR was performed with 11 mm reusable trocar, 10 or 5 mm 30° scopes, 10 mm ultrasound probe, curved reusable instruments, and straight disposable bipolar shears. Results. Neither conversion to open surgery nor insertion of supplementary trocars was necessary. Median laparoscopic time was 105.5 minutes and median blood loss 275 mL. Median final umbilical scar length was 1.5 cm, and median length of stay was 4 days. No early or late complications occurred. Conclusion. SITLLR remains a challenging procedure. It is feasible in highly selected patients, requiring experience in hepatobiliary and laparoscopic surgery and skills in single-incision laparoscopy. Apart from cosmetic benefit, our experience and literature review did not show significant advantages if compared with multiport LLR, underlying that specific indications remain to be established.","Dapri, Giovanni; Dimarco, Livia; Cadière, Guy-Bernard; Donckier, Vincent","HPB surgery : a world journal of hepatic, pancreatic and biliary surgery",432,17

This study was single-centre study to evaluate the technical and clinical success of proximal protection devices as the first choice for embolic protection in symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in patients with bilateral, advanced lesions of carotid arteries (bilateral stenoses or stenosis and occlusion). METHODS This was a post hoc analysis, with 30-day follow up. We analyzed results of treatment of 38 patients who underwent 38 CAS with PPS, 17 such procedures in asymptomatic (group A), and 21 in symptomatic individuals (group B). The GORE® Flow Reversal System (W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was used in 2 patients, and the Mo.Ma Ultra device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in 36 patients. Mean age was 68±7 years, 65% percent of patient were male. RESULTS There were no procedural and during 30-day follow-up neurologic events. Intolerance of occlusion system occurred in 4 patients (11%) in both groups with any later symptoms. Risk factors of this adverse event comprised: lesions of the left internal carotid lesion and coexisiting diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS CAS in high risk patients with bilateral lesions of carotid arteries with the use of PPS seems to be a relatively very safe procedure.","Latacz, Paweł; Simka, Marian; Popiela, Tadeusz; Kazibudzki, Marek; Mrowiecki, Tomasz",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,432,8

Here, we used diagnostic leukapheresis (DLA) to enrich CTCs from patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) and explored whether organoids provide a platform for ex vivo treatment modelling. METHODS We prospectively screened 102 patients with mPCa and performed DLA in 40 patients with ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL blood. We enriched CTCs from DLA using white blood cell (WBC) depletion alone or combined with EpCAM selection. The enriched CTC samples were cultured in 3D to obtain organoids and used for downstream analyses. RESULTS The DLA procedure resulted in a median yield of 5312 CTCs as compared with 22 CTCs in 7.5 mL of blood. Using WBC depletion, we recovered 46% of the CTCs, which reduced to 12% with subsequent EpCAM selection. From the isolated and enriched CTC samples, organoid expansion succeeded in 35%. Successful organoid cultures contained significantly higher CTC numbers at initiation. Moreover, we performed treatment modelling in one organoid cell line and identified substantial tumour heterogeneity in CTCs using single cell DNA sequencing. CONCLUSIONS DLA is an efficient method to enrich CTCs, although the modest success rate of culturing CTCs precludes large scale clinical application. Our data do suggest that DLA and subsequent processing provides a rich source of viable tumour cells. Therefore, DLA offers a promising alternative to biopsy procedures to obtain sufficient number of tumour cells to study sequential samples in patients with mPCa.

Combined genomics and transcription factor profiling reveal that MAST1, a critical platinum resistance factor that reprograms the MAPK pathway, is upregulated upon cisplatin exposure through activated transcription factor GR. Mechanistically, cisplatin binds to C622 in GR and recruits GR to the nucleus for its activation, which induces MAST1 expression and consequently reactivates MEK signaling. GR nuclear translocation and MAST1 upregulation coordinately occur in patient tumors collected after platinum treatment, and align with patient treatment resistance. Co-treatment with dexamethasone and cisplatin restores cisplatin-resistant tumor growth, whereas addition of the MAST1 inhibitor lestaurtinib abrogates tumor growth while preserving the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on inflammation in vivo. These findings not only provide insights into the underlying mechanism of GR in cisplatin resistance but also offer an effective alternative therapeutic strategy to improve the clinical outcome of patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy with GR agonists.","Pan, Chaoyun; Kang, JiHoon; Hwang, Jung Seok; Li, Jie; Boese, Austin C; Wang, Xu; Yang, Likun; Boggon, Titus J; Chen, Georgia Z; Saba, Nabil F; Shin, Dong M; Magliocca, Kelly R; Jin, Lingtao; Kang, Sumin",Nature communications,432,7

Normally, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) protects the vascular endothelium from damage from oxidized phospholipids, which accumulate under conditions of oxidative stress. The current work evaluated the antioxidant function of HDL in IIM patients. METHODS HDL's antioxidant function was measured in IIM patients using a cell-free assay, which assesses the ability of isolated patient HDL to inhibit oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and is reported as the HDL inflammatory index (HII). Cholesterol profiles were measured for all patients, and subgroup analysis included assessment of oxidized fatty acids in HDL and plasma MPO activity. A subgroup of IIM patients was compared with healthy controls. RESULTS The antioxidant function of HDL was significantly worse in patients with IIM (n = 95) compared with healthy controls (n = 41) [mean (s.d.) HII 1.12 (0.61) vs 0.82 (0.13), P < 0.0001]. Higher HII associated with higher plasma MPO activity [mean (s.d.) 13.2 (9.1) vs 9.1 (4.6), P = 0.0006] and higher oxidized fatty acids in HDL. Higher 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in HDL correlated with worse diffusion capacity in patients with interstitial lung disease (r = -0.58, P = 0.02), and HDL's antioxidant function was most impaired in patients with autoantibodies against melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) or anti-synthetase antibodies. In multivariate analysis including 182 IIM patients, higher HII was associated with higher disease activity and DM diagnosis. CONCLUSION The antioxidant function of HDL is abnormal in IIM patients and may warrant further investigation for its role in propagating microvascular inflammation and damage in this patient population.","Bae, Sangmae Sharon; Lee, Yuen Yin; Shahbazian, Ani; Wang, Jennifer; Meriwether, David; Golub, Ilana; Oganesian, Buzand; Dowd, Tyler; Reddy, Srinivasa T; Charles-Schoeman, Christina",Rheumatology,432,28

Comparative genomics can inform a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Previous strains of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and Middle-East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been known to cause acute lung injuries in humans. SARS-CoV-2 shares genetic similarity with SARS-CoV with some modification in the S protein leading to their enhanced binding affinity toward the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of human lung cells. This expert review examines the features of all three coronaviruses through a conceptual lens of comparative genomics. In particular, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 that enables its survival within the host is highlighted. Susceptibility of humans to coronavirus outbreaks in the 21st century calls for comparisons of the transmission history, hosts, reservoirs, and fatality rates of these viruses so that evidence-based and effective planetary health interventions can be devised to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks. Comparative genomics offers new insights on putative and novel viral targets with an eye to both therapeutic innovation and prevention. We conclude the expert review by (1) articulating the lessons learned so far, whereas the research is still being actively sought after in the field, and (2) the challenges and prospects in deciphering the linkages among multiomics biological variability and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Asrani, Purva; Hasan, Gulam Mustafa; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,432,28

However, measurements of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the peripheral blood may not adequately reflect early-stage decompensated heart failure (HF). Given that right heart catheterization (RHC) can facilitate measurements of intracardiac NT-proBNP, in this study our aim was to evaluate the predictive role of right ventricular (RV) NT-proBNP measurements in patients with PAH. METHODS AND RESULTS We prospectively collected intracardiac blood samples for NT-proBNP measurements from patients diagnosed with World Health Organization Group I PAH during RHC. Clinical information including the aetiology of PAH (idiopathic, connective tissue disease, or congenital heart disease) and REVEAL scores were recorded. The primary endpoint was hospitalization for decompensated HF; median duration of follow-up was 28 months. Among the 62 patients evaluated, 12 reached the designated endpoint. REVEAL risk scores were higher among patients hospitalized for HF. We detected no significant differences in plasma NT-proBNP levels in peripheral circulation, in the right atrium, or in pulmonary arterial blood; however, significantly higher levels of NT-proBNP were detected in the RV in patients diagnosed with PAH. RV NT-proBNP was a sensitive predictor (cut-off value 1500 pg/mL) of subsequent hospitalization for HF. Our findings indicate that RV NT-proBNP levels add predictive value to REVEAL scores with respect to future hospitalization due to HF. CONCLUSIONS Right ventricular NT-proBNP levels combined with REVEAL 2.0 could predict the development of subsequent HF in patients with PAH and may be a potential biomarker.","Chang, Wei-Ting; Shih, Jhih-Yuan; Hong, Chon-Seng; Lin, Yu-Wen; Chen, Yi-Chen; Ho, Chung-Han; Chen, Zhih-Cherng; Roan, Jun-Neng; Hsu, Chih-Hsin",ESC heart failure,432,1

From January to June 2010, 63 cow-calf-pairs from 20 different farms near Zürich, Switzerland have been investigated. Each cowcalf- pair was visited three times within the first 6 weeks of life to collect data of the farm and animals, as well as blood, faecal, colostral and milk samples. An ELISA using sporozoite antigen was developed for the specific detection of anti-Cryptosporidium-IgG in blood- and colostral serum. The IgG concentration in the bloodand colostral serum was determined using radial immuno diffusion test (RID). White blood cell isolation and differential blood cell counts and California Mastitis Test were performed. Bacteriological studies on quarter-milk-samples were carried out. Cryptosporidium oocysts were diagnosed with the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining, other protozoa with the SAFC method and Eimeria oocysts and helminth eggs were diagnosed with the combined sedimentation/floatation test. ELISAs were performed for the detection of rota- and coronavirus, E. coli F5 and Cryptosporidium spp. in bovine feces (bio-X Diagnostics®, Belgium). The highest prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts was 54.0% and found 7 to 20 days post natum, whereas 47.1% were suffering from diarrhea. The transfer of total IgG with the colostrum and the humoral immunity of the calf could not prevent any infection with Cryptosporidium, but the severity of the diarrhea symptoms decreased with increasing total IgG concentrations. Calves housed in open sheds showed significantly more often diarrhea, i. e. they shed more Cryptosporidium oocysts during the first 4 days and 7 to 20 days post natum, respectively. Halofuginone (Halocur®) is approved for prophylaxis against cryptosporidiosis, but it showed no effect on the excretion of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the present study.","Weber, S E; Lippuner, C; Corti, S; Deplazes, P; Hässig, M",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,432,23

The assembly and function of tight junctions are intimately linked to the actomyosin cytoskeleton and, hence, are under the control of signalling mechanisms that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. Tight junctions not only receive signals that guide their assembly and function, but transmit information to the cell interior to regulate cell proliferation, migration and survival. As a crucial component of the epithelial barrier, they are often targeted by pathogenic viruses and bacteria, aiding infection and the development of disease. In this Commentary, we review recent progress in the understanding of the molecular signalling mechanisms that drive junction assembly and function, and the signalling processes by which tight junctions regulate cell behaviour and survival. We also discuss the way in which junctional components are exploited by pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and how this might affect junctional signalling mechanisms.","Zihni, Ceniz; Balda, Maria S; Matter, Karl",Journal of cell science,432,26

Interleukin 6 as a predictor of COVID-19 outcomes.,17.74563,7.7873607,2020-10-29,"BACKGROUND With the increasing number of randomized control trials (RCTs) being conducted and published in plastic surgery, complete reporting of trial information is critical for readers to properly evaluate a trial's methodology and arrive at appropriate conclusions about its merits and applicability to patients. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was introduced to address the limited guidance for reporting trial interventions. OBJECTIVES We will apply the TIDieR checklist to evaluate the completeness of intervention reporting of RCTs in plastic surgery, compare the quality of intervention reporting before and after the guideline was published and evaluate characteristics associated with TIDieR compliance. METHODS A PubMed search identified one cohort published prior to the release of TIDieR and another published after its release. From the final sample, the TIDieR checklist was applied to intervention descriptions and relevant study characteristics were extracted in a duplicate, blinded manner. RESULTS 130 trials were included for analysis. The mean TIDieR score was 6.4 out of 12. Five items were reported 90% of the time, while 4 items were reported fewer than 10% of the time. We found that TIDieR publication did not affect intervention reporting (p=.22). CONCLUSION Our study identified areas in which intervention reporting could be improved. The extent of TIDieR adoption by trialists appears to be limited, and greater efforts are needed to disseminate this reporting guideline if widespread uptake is to be expected. Alternately, it may be beneficial to incorporate TIDieR into the more widely recognized CONSORT statement.","Evans, Sheridan; Rauh, Shelby; Jellison, Samuel; Diener, Brian; Agha, Riaz; Vassar, Matt",Aesthetic surgery journal,432,27

Alterations on both their sugar and the heterocyclic parts may lead to significant changes in the spectrum of their biological action and the degree of selective toxicity, as well as in their physicochemical properties. METHOD C5-arylalkynyl-β-D-ribofuranonucleosides 3-6, 3΄-deoxy 12-15, 3΄-deoxy-3΄-C-methyl-β-D-ribofurananucleosides 18-21 and 2΄-deoxy-β-D-ribofuranonucleosides 23-26 of uracil, were synthesized using a one-step Sonogashira reaction under microwave irradiation and subsequent deprotection. RESULTS All newly synthesized nucleosides were tested for their antitumor or antiviral activity. Moderate cytostatic activity against cervix carcinoma (HeLa), murine leukemia (L1210) and human lymphocyte (CEM) tumor cell lines was displayed by the protected 3΄-deoxy derivatives 12b, 12c, 12d, and the 3΄-deoxy-3΄-methyl 18a, 18b, 18c. Antiviral evaluation revealed appreciable activity against Coxsackie virus B4, Respiratory syncytial virus, Yellow Fever Virus and Human Coronavirus (229E) for the 3΄-deoxy compounds 12b, 14, and the 3΄-deoxy-3΄-methyl 18a, 18c, 18d, accompanied by low cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION This report describes the total and facile synthesis of modified furanononucleosides of uracil, with alterations on both the sugar and the heterocyclic portions. Compounds 12b, 14 and 18a,c,d showed noticeable antiviral activity against a series of RNA viruses and merit further biological and structural optimization investigations.","Kollatos, Nikolaos; Mitsos, Christos; Manta, Stella; Tzioumaki, Niki; Giannakas, Christos; Alexouli, Tania; Panagiotopoulou, Aggeliki; Schols, Dominique; Andrei, Graciela; Komioti, Dimitri",Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),432,19

Ectopic pregnancy occurring in tubal stump after tubectomy is extremely rare, and the frequency of tubal stump pregnancy is approximately 0.4% of all pregnancies. We report one of these rare cases of ectopic pregnancy in a 26-year-old Japanese woman, gravida 4, parity 1. She had undergone laparoscopic tubectomy because of a tubal pregnancy two years ago. She was presented to our hospital with a positive pregnancy test, but no gestational sac was detected in the uterus by echography, even though the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood was elevated to 8,900 mIU/mL. Laparoscopic surgery for ectopic pregnancy was performed. During surgery, the position of the pregnancy was found to be in the tubal stump, where tubectomy had already been performed, and the gestational sac was successfully removed. After the surgery, the condition of the patient uneventfully improved and she was discharged from the hospital three days after the surgery. The diagnosis of tubal stump pregnancy is more difficult than that of the more common positions of an ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube, and so it is more important to carefully examine the patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopic surgery is one of the options for tubal stump pregnancy if diagnosed early and if the condition of the patient is stable.","Nishida, Masakazu; Miyamoto, Yuko; Kawano, Yasushi; Takebayashi, Kanetoshi; Narahara, Hisashi",Clinical medicine insights.

The psychological outcomes of students who relocated during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined mandated relocation experiences related to self-reported worry, grief, loneliness, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We analyzed cross-sectional survey data obtained from April 9 to August 4, 2020 on 791 young adults (ages 18-30 years) who were enrolled at a U.S. university. The CARES 2020 Project (COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study) is an online survey of young adults' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment relied on snowball sampling. Participants were asked if they were required to relocate from campus and among those who did, their experiences in moving. COVID-19-related worry and grief, loneliness, and depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed. RESULTS Approximately one-third of students reported being mandated to relocate. Students mandated to relocate reported more COVID-19-related grief, loneliness, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared to those who did not even after controlling for the severity level of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Students who had to leave behind valuable personal belongings reported more COVID-19-related worries, grief, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Students who were mandated to relocate reported worse psychological outcomes compared to students who were not mandated to relocate. Our findings have implications for addressing the psychological impact of evacuating college campuses during public health emergencies and other disasters.","Conrad, Rachel C; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Koire, Amanda; Pinder-Amaker, Stephanie; Liu, Cindy H",Journal of psychiatric research,432,1

This included restricted testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, and enforcement of a nation-wide lockdown starting 25 March 2020. The objectives of this study were to i) describe the age, gender distribution, and mortality among COVID-19 patients identified till 14 April 2020 and predict the range of contact rate; and ii) predict the number of COVID-19 infections after 40 days of lockdown. Methods: We used a cross-sectional descriptive design for the first objective and a susceptible-infected-removed model for in silico predictions. We collected data from government-controlled and crowdsourced websites. Results: Studying age and gender parameters of 1161 Indian COVID-19 patients, the median age was 38 years (IQR, 27-52) with 20-39 year-old males being the most affected group. The number of affected patients were 854 (73.6%) men and 307 (26.4%) women. If the current contact rate continues (0.25-27), India may have 110460 to 220575 infected persons at the end of 40 days lockdown.

They become distressed when they have problems with interpersonal conflict, change, and loss of relationships. In this article, we review the basics of IPT and then describe the ways in which cultural adaptations can be made for people in Asia. Both are large tasks-to summarize IPT concisely while providing sufficient information is difficult; describing cultural adaptions for people in geographical areas from Russia to China to India to Southeast and Central Asia and all of the ethnic and language groups that area includes is nigh well impossible within a review article.

We analyzed the long-term outcome after splenectomy (median, 8.7 years) focusing on sepsis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT), and retained accessory spleen. METHODS In total, 141 consecutive children after open (n = 89; 63%) or laparoscopic (n = 52; 37%) splenectomy from 1991 to 2010 were followed up through nationwide registries for septic infections, PVT, and causes of death. Sixty-six patients (58% of survivors) answered a structured questionnaire on infections, abdominal symptoms, and general health, and 64 (laparoscopic n = 26, open n = 38) consented to ultrasonography of the portal venous system. RESULTS Median operation age was 8.8 years (range, 1.0-22). Reoperations were required for bleeding after open procedures (n = 1) and retained accessory spleen after laparoscopic procedures (n = 3). Postsplenectomy sepsis occurred after a median of 1.7 years (range, 0.2-5.9) in 11 patients (8%), of whom 10 had an underlying immunodeficiency. No cases of PVT were observed, although the median portal vein flow was 1,130 mL/min (range, 440-2200) and diameter was 9.9 mm (range, 7-15) at a median follow-up of 9.5 years (range, 2.0-22) after splenectomy. Twenty-seven patients (19%) died after 8.7 years (0.03-23.00). The most common cause of death was the underlying malignancy (n = 15), with sepsis being an additional cause of death in 5 patients. CONCLUSION Postsplenectomy sepsis was associated almost exclusively with an underlying immunodeficiency with a high mortality rate. No PVT was observed. The overall risk of retained accessory spleen was around 7%, and was slightly greater after laparoscopic operation.","Luoto, Topi T; Pakarinen, Mikko P; Koivusalo, Antti",Surgery,432,1

Kidney disease, usually presenting as acute kidney injury (AKI), is particularly severe among patients with COVID-19. It is unknown, however, whether such injury results from direct kidney infection with COVID-19's causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or from indirect mechanisms. Methods Using ex vivo cell models, we sought to analyze SARS-Cov2 interactions with kidney tubular cells and assess direct tubular injury. These models comprised primary human kidney epithelial cells (derived from nephrectomies and grown as proliferating monolayers) and more quiescent three-dimensional kidney spheroids. Results We demonstrated that viral entry molecules and high baseline levels of type 1 interferon-related molecules were present in monolayers and kidney spheroids. Although both models support viral infection and replication, they did not exhibit a cytopathic effect and cell death, outcomes that were strongly present in SARS-CoV-2-infected controls (Vero E6 cultures). A comparison of monolayer and spheroid cultures demonstrated higher infectivity and replication of SARS-Cov-2 in actively proliferating monolayers, although the spheroid cultures exhibited higher levels of ACE2. Monolayers exhibited elevation of some tubular injury molecules-including molecules related to fibrosis (COL1A1 and STAT6) and dedifferentiation (SNAI2)-as well as a loss of cell identity, evident by reduction in megalin (LRP2). The three-dimensional spheroids were less prone to such injury. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney cells without a cytopathic effect. AKI-induced cellular proliferation may potentially intensify infectivity and tubular damage by SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that early intervention in AKI is warranted to help minimize kidney infection.","Omer, Dorit; Pleniceanu, Oren; Gnatek, Yehudit; Namestnikov, Michael; Cohen-Zontag, Osnat; Goldberg, Sanja; Friedman, Yehudit Eden; Friedman, Nehemya; Mandelboim, Michal; Vitner, Einat; Achdout, Hagit; Avraham, Roy; Zahavy, Eran; Israely, Tomer; Mayan, Haim; Dekel, Benjamin",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,432,23

To reveal the effects of light on the laying performance of ducks and its possible regulatory mechanisms, Shanma ducks at 52 weeks age were divided into three group treated with different photoperiods of 16 hr (control group), 24 hr (long-photoperiod group, LP), and 8 hr (short-photoperiod group, SP). Laying performance, endocrine-related hormones and gene expression of three groups were compared. The results showed that laying performance was greatest in the LP group; including laying rate, average egg weight and feed-egg ratio. Compared to the SP group, GnIH plasma concentration was decreased in the LP group, whilst FSH was increased in the LP group. GnIHR gene expression in the pituitary and large yellow follicles were downregulated in the LP group. The expression of Mel-a in large white follicles, and Mel-b and Mel-c in the hypothalamus were also downregulated in the LP group. Altogether these results suggest that extended photoperiods may promote the laying performance of ducks by inhibiting the secretion of GnIH and the expression of GnIHR and melatonin receptor genes.","Ouyang, Hongjia; Yang, Bo; Lao, Yongcong; Tang, Jun; Tian, Yunbo; Huang, Yunmao",Veterinary medicine and science,432,19

These themes fit within safety cultures described by participants: individual culture, blame culture, and collaborative culture. The preventive terminology used in the European health care facility focuses on hospital hygiene from the perspective of environmental risk (individual culture). In Canadian health care facilities, the focus was on risk management for infection prevention either from a punitive perspective (blame culture) or from a collaborative perspective (collaborative culture).

Given reports of similar transmission mechanisms for COVID-19 and seasonal coronaviruses, we investigated whether hand hygiene impacted the risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infections. Methods: Data were drawn from three successive winter cohorts (2006-2009) of the England-wide Flu Watch study. Participants ( n=1633) provided baseline estimates of hand hygiene behaviour. Coronavirus infections were identified from nasal swabs using RT-PCR. Poisson mixed models estimated the effect of hand hygiene on personal risk of coronavirus illness, both unadjusted and adjusted for confounding by age and healthcare worker status. Results: Moderate-frequency handwashing (6-10 times per day) predicted a lower personal risk of coronavirus infection (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) =0.64, p=0.04). There was no evidence for a dose-response effect of handwashing, with results for higher levels of hand hygiene (>10 times per day) not significant (aIRR =0.83, p=0.42). Conclusions: This is the first empirical evidence that regular handwashing can reduce personal risk of acquiring seasonal coronavirus infection.

A superconducting loop that includes a Josephson junction can store a flux quantum state in picoseconds. However, the requirement for the loop inductance to create a bi-state hysteresis sets a limit on the minimal area occupied by a single memory cell. Here, we present a miniaturized superconducting memory cell based on a Three-Dimensional (3D) Nb nano-Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (nano-SQUID). The major cell area here fits within an 8×9 μm2 rectangle with a cross-selected function for memory implementation. The cell shows periodic tunable hysteresis between two neighbouring flux quantum states produced by bias current sweeping because of the large modulation depth of the 3D nano-SQUID (~66%). Furthermore, the measured Current-Phase Relations (CPRs) of nano-SQUIDs are shown to be skewed from a sine function, as predicted by theoretical modelling. The skewness and the critical current of 3D nano-SQUIDs are linearly correlated. It is also found that the hysteresis loop size is in a linear scaling relationship with the CPR skewness using the statistics from characterisation of 26 devices. We show that the CPR skewness range of π/4-3π/4 is equivalent to a large loop inductance in creating a stable bi-state hysteresis for memory implementation. Therefore, the skewed CPR of 3D nano-SQUID enables further superconducting memory cell miniaturization by overcoming the inductance limitation of the loop area.","Chen, Lei; Wu, Lili; Wang, Yue; Pan, Yinping; Zhang, Denghui; Zeng, Junwen; Liu, Xiaoyu; Ma, Linxian; Peng, Wei; Wang, Yihua; Ren, Jie; Wang, Zhen",ACS nano,432,5

A systematic review.,17.682384,7.7678723,2021-06-28,"OBJECTIVE Verbal face-to-face feedback on clinical task performance is a fundamental component of health professions education. Experts argue that feedback is critical for performance improvement, but the evidence is limited. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of face-to-face verbal feedback from a health professional, compared with alternative or no feedback, on the objective workplace task performance of another health professional. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS We searched the full holdings of Ovid MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO up to 1 February 2019 and searched references of included studies. Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction and quality appraisal. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of feedback, in which health professionals were randomised to individual verbal face-to-face feedback compared with no feedback or alternative feedback and available as full-text publications in English. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach. For feedback compared with no feedback, outcome data from included studies were pooled using a random effects model. RESULTS In total, 26 trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 2307 participants. For the effect of verbal face-to-face feedback on performance compared with no feedback, when studies at high risk of bias were excluded, eight studies involving 392 health professionals were included in a meta-analysis: the standardised mean difference (SMD) was 0.7 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.03; p<0.001) in favour of feedback. The calculated SMD prediction interval was -0.06 to 1.46. For feedback compared with alternative feedback, studies could not be pooled due to substantial design and intervention heterogeneity. All included studies were summarised, and key factors likely to influence performance were identified including components within feedback interventions, instruction and practice opportunities. CONCLUSIONS Verbal face-to-face feedback in the health professions may result in a moderate to large improvement in workplace task performance, compared with no feedback. However, the quality of evidence was low, primarily due to risk of bias and publication bias. Further research is needed. In particular, we found a lack of high-quality trials that clearly reported key components likely to influence performance.

Outcomes and follow-up were recorded until February 5th, 2021. RESULTS Forty patients were included. Twenty-four patients (60%) were men; the median age was 53 (40-60) years old; median HT time was 34 months and median follow-up time 162 days. The majority needed hospitalization (83%). Immunosuppressive therapy was reduced/withdrawn in the majority of patients, except from steroids, which were maintained.

A subgroup of infants had cranial ultrasonography, eye fundoscopy, hearing and neurological examinations, and Bayley III screening tests within three months of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of pregnancy losses and anomalies detected at birth or within three months according to the gestational age of infection. RESULTS Overall, 511 ZIKV-infected women were identified from a total of 1116 symptomatic women; as there were two twins, there were a total of 513 fetuses included. In total, 13 of these 513 (2.5%;95%CI:1.5-4.3) presented with major signs of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Of the 511 women there were 489 livebirths and 24 (4.7%) pregnancy losses (20 miscarriages and 4 stillbirths). ZIKV-related anomalies occurred in the offspring of 42/511(8.2%) mothers. Microcephaly or other CNS malformations were diagnosed in 1/4 (25.0%) stillbirths and in 19/489(3.9%;95% CI:2.5-5.9) of the live-born infants. Fetal abnormalities were 14.0 (95%CI:7.6-26.0) times more likely with gestational infection occurring in ≤11 weeks. On follow up of 280 asymptomatic infants, 2/155(1.3%) had eye abnormalities, 1/207(0.5%) had CNS imaging findings, and 16/199(8%) presented neurological alert signs. CONCLUSIONS This prospective population-based study represents the largest Brazilian cohort study of ZIKV in pregnancy. Congenital anomalies potentially associated with CZS are less frequent than previously thought. There is a strong relationship between the gestational age of infection (≤11 weeks) and worse early infant prognosis. A notable proportion of apparently asymptomatic newborns can present with subclinical findings within three months of age.","Coutinho, Conrado Milani; de Moura Negrini, Silvia Fabiana Biason; de Almeida E Araujo, Daniel Cardoso; Teixeira, Sara Reis; Amaral, Fabiana Rezende; Moro, Marília Carolina Razera; Fernandes, Juliana Dias Crivelenti Pereira; da Motta, Márcia Soares Freitas; de Moura Negrini, Bento Vidal; Caldas, Carla Andréa Cardoso Tanuri; Anastasio, Adriana Ribeiro Tavares; Furtado, João Marcello; Bárbaro, Adriana Aparecida Tiraboschi; Yamamoto, Aparecida Yulie; Duarte, Geraldo; Mussi-Pinhata, Marisa Márcia",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,432,1

The aim of surgical intervention is definitive stabilisation of the trachea and of both main bronchi by posterior splinting of the Paries membranaceus with a polypropylene mesh. This operation is an appropriate treatment option for patients with documented severe tracheobronchomalacia or excessive dynamic airway collapse and is ultimately the only therapy that can achieve permanent symptom control.

A systematic review.,17.843372,7.8334928,2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND The intubation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) puts health care workers at risk of infection through aerosol, droplet and contact contamination. We evaluated the risk of droplet and contact contamination for health care workers using 3 intubation barrier techniques as part of a quality assurance study at our institution. METHODS This randomized quality assurance study was completed at a tertiary academic hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on Apr. 4, 2020. Participants in personal protective equipment performed simulated intubations on a manikin with (a) no barrier, (b) a clear plastic sheet covering the manikin and (c) a plexiglass intubation box over the manikin, in random order. Fluorescein was ejected from inside the manikin's mouth to simulate droplet and contact spread during a standard intubation sequence. Two blinded independent assessors evaluated the location and degree of contamination on the intubator and assistant using an ultraviolet light. Contamination severity was rated in a standard fashion (0 = none; 1 = minor; 2 = major). The primary outcome was total contamination score and secondary outcomes were scores between intubator and assistant, anatomic areas contaminated and qualitative feedback on ease of intubation. RESULTS Five participants completed this study. Total contamination score was different between the 3 groups for the intubator (p = 0.02) but not the assistant (p = 0.2). For the intubator, the total contamination score was higher when the sheet was used (median 29 [interquartile range (IQR) 25-34]) than when the box was used (median 17 [IQR 15-22]) or when no barrier was used (median 18 [IQR 13-21]). All 5 participants reported challenges during intubation using the sheet. INTERPRETATION Use of a plastic sheet while intubating patients with COVID-19 may increase the risk of droplet and contact contamination during intubation and impede intubation. Further study should be undertaken before implementing barrier techniques in practice.","Rose, Peter; Veall, John; Chima, Navraj; Vowels, Elena; Chitnis, Shruti; Flexman, Alana; Tang, Raymond",CMAJ open,432,1

In particular, studies using validated olfactory tests are very rare to date. AIMS/OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine the olfactory function of COVID-19 recoveries by a detailed olfactory test. METHODS 91 patients with PCR-confirmed, past COVID-19 disease were included. Olfactory history was taken using a questionnaire. Olfactory function was evaluated with the sniffin' sticks test, tasting function with taste sprays. RESULTS 80 patients had experienced sudden olfactory loss during the course of disease and at the time of testing, 33 patients subjectively still had an impaired olfactory sense. Around 8 weeks had passed since the onset of symptoms. 45.1% of the tested individuals were still hyposmic according to the olfactory test while 53.8% showed an olfactory performance within the normal range. Patients' self-assessment correlated poorly with the measured olfactory performance. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE Half of the patients with an olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID-19 still have olfactory impairments after two months, although not all of these patients subjectively notice a restriction. Long-term measurements must confirm whether all affected patients will make full recovery.","Otte, Martin Sylvester; Eckel, Hans Nikolaus Caspar; Poluschkin, Leonard; Klussmann, Jens Peter; Luers, Jan Christoffer",Acta oto-laryngologica,432,23

DESIGN Prospective crossover randomized controlled trial. SETTING University hospital ICU. PATIENTS Fourteen intubated patients mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS Six 25-minute trials randomly performed applying both pressure support ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist during wakefulness and with two doses of propofol, administered by Target Control Infusion, determining light (1.26 ± 0.35 μg/mL) and deep (2.52 ± 0.71 μg/mL) sedation, as defined by the bispectral index and Ramsay Sedation Scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We measured electrical activity of the diaphragm to assess neural drive and calculated its integral over time during 1 minute (∫electrical activity of the diaphragm/min) to estimate diaphragm energy expenditure (effort), arterial blood gases, airway pressure, tidal volume and its coefficient of variation, respiratory rate, neural timing components, and calculated the ineffective triggering index. Increasing the depth of sedation did not cause significant modifications of respiratory timing, while determined a progressive significant decrease in neural drive (with both modes) and effort (in pressure support ventilation only). In pressure support ventilation, the difference in ineffective triggering index between wakefulness and light sedation was negligible (from 5.9% to 7.6%, p = 0.97); with deep sedation, however, ineffective triggering index increased up to 21.8% (p < 0.0001, compared to both wakefulness and light sedation). With neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, ineffective triggering index fell to 0%, regardless of the depth of sedation. With both modes, deep sedation caused a significant increase in PaCO2, which resulted, however, from different breathing patterns and patient-ventilator interactions. CONCLUSIONS In pressure support ventilation, deep propofol sedation increased asynchronies, while light sedation did not. Propofol reduced the respiratory drive, while breathing timing was not significantly affected. Gas exchange and breathing pattern were also influenced by propofol infusion to an extent that varied with the depth of sedation and the mode of ventilation.","Vaschetto, Rosanna; Cammarota, Gianmaria; Colombo, Davide; Longhini, Federico; Grossi, Francesca; Giovanniello, Andrea; Della Corte, Francesco; Navalesi, Paolo",Critical care medicine,432,7

However, a small percentage of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC do respond, and the characteristics of these patients are not known. Here, we identify the characteristics of patients who may respond to ICI therapy for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS The medical records of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations who received PD-1/PD-L1 antibody monotherapy at nine institutions were reviewed. RESULTS In total, 58 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC were analyzed. Various clinical factors such as smoking history and EGFR mutation type were not associated with progression-free survival (PFS) of ICIs, while the PFS of prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was inversely associated with that of ICIs. Patients who responded to prior EGFR TKIs for > 10 months exhibited a significantly shorter response to ICIs compared to those who had responded for ≤ 10 months (PFS of ICI: 1.6 vs. 1.9 months; hazard ratio: 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.26-5.12; p = 0.009). However, patients who responded to ICIs for > 6 months responded to prior EGFR TKIs for significantly shorter periods compared to those who responded to ICIs for ≤ 6 months (PFS of prior EGFR TKI: 5.3 vs. 12.1 months; log-rank test: p = 0.0025). CONCLUSION The duration of response to prior EGFR TKIs could be a predictive marker of ICI therapy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients.","Ichihara, Eiki; Harada, Daijiro; Inoue, Koji; Shibayama, Takuo; Hosokawa, Shinobu; Kishino, Daizo; Harita, Shingo; Ochi, Nobuaki; Oda, Naohiro; Hara, Naofumi; Hotta, Katsuyuki; Maeda, Yoshinobu; Kiura, Katsuyuki","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",432,1

Reasons for use include management of psychosocial stressors, physical and psychological symptoms. We explored the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on on patients' cannabis use, hypothesizing that users would be increasing their use due to heightened stress and increased uncertainty. METHODS Participants were part of an anonymous online survey of cannabis use in cancer. Items specific to COVID-19 were administered between April and June 2020. RESULTS Thirty-one percent of respondents (n = 26) confirmed they used cannabis during COVID-19. The top 5 reasons for use were sleep, anxiety, nausea, pain, and appetite. Ninety-two percent denied they were using cannabis for new or different symptoms. Eighty-one percent were using about the same amount as before, 11.5% were using less, and 8% more. Only 12% reported that product cost affected their use and that they had changed the way in which they used cannabis. Eight percent were stockpiling product so that they did not run out during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The percentages of those reporting a change in cannabis use were modest. Increased use may reflect efforts to relieve stress. Decreased use may reflect barriers to securing unregulated products and perceived vulnerability to the effects of infection on the respiratory system. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor its effects on cancer patients as it relates to psychosocial stressors, psychological symptoms, and cannabis use.","Donovan, Kristine A; Portman, Diane G",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,432,2

This forms the basis for evaluating SPA for prosthetic ventral hernia repair. We report a new SPA technique of ventral hernia repair using working-channel endoscope, standard laparoscopic instruments, and 10-mm port. METHODS Prospective experience with SPA prosthetic repair of primary and incisional ventral hernia in 52 patients for 55 ventral hernias is presented. Median (range) patient age was 46 years (26-85 years), and BMI was 28 kg/m2 (20-38 kg/m2). Mean fascial defect was 16.2 cm2 for primary hernia (n=23) and 48.3 cm2 for incisional hernia (n=32). Intraperitoneal composite mesh repair was achieved through single 10-mm flank port using working-channel endoscope. Meshes were fixed using absorbable tackers and transfascial stitches. RESULTS SPA repair of primary and incisional ventral hernia was completed in all cases without conversion to standard laparoscopy. Median (range) operative time was 54 min (39-95 min). Mesh size ranged from 118 to 500 cm2. No intra- or postoperative complications were recorded, except two seromas. Median (range) hospital stay was 1 day (1-5 days). One patient presented prolonged postoperative pain on mesh fixation that resolved after 3 months. No recurrence or port-site incisional hernias have been recorded at median (range) follow-up of 16 months (3-28 months). CONCLUSIONS SPA prosthetic repair of primary and incisional ventral hernia is easily feasible according to natural exposition by pneumoperitoneum and gravity. In the present series, SPA ventral hernia repair appears to be safe for experienced SPA surgeons. It may decrease parietal trauma and scarring in patients prone to incisional hernia. SPA repair may be associated with a decrease in rate of port-site incisional hernia compared with multiport laparoscopy, but this has to be verified by randomized trial with standard laparoscopic approach on long-term follow-up.","Bucher, Pascal; Pugin, François; Morel, Philippe",Surgical endoscopy,432,19

Infrequently, novel or reemergent strains of influenza A virus have caused rapid, severe global pandemics resulting in millions of fatalities. The ability to efficiently and accurately detect and differentiate respiratory viruses is paramount for effective treatment, infection control, and epidemiological surveillance. We evaluated the ability of two FDA-cleared nucleic acid-based tests, the semiautomated respiratory virus nucleic acid test (VRNAT) and the fully automated respiratory virus nucleic acid test SP (RVNAT(SP)) (Nanosphere Inc., Northbrook, IL) to detect influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV A/B) from clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Detection of viral RNA in both tests is based on nucleic acid amplification followed by hybridization to capture probes immobilized on a glass slide. A novel technology utilizing gold nanoparticle-conjugated probes is utilized to detect the presence of captured target DNA. This microarray-based approach to detection has proven to be more sensitive than the traditional culture/direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) method for detecting RSV and influenza viruses in clinical specimens, including the novel 2009 H1N1 strain. Specifically, we report 98.0% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity for the VRNAT compared to culture/DFA. Further, the VRNAT detected virus in an additional 58% of specimens that were culture negative. These data were confirmed using bidirectional sequencing. Evaluation of the fully automated RVNAT(SP), which is built on the same detection technology as the VRNAT but contains an updated processor enabling complete automation, revealed the two tests to be functionally equivalent. Thus, the RVNAT(SP) is a fully automated sample-to-result test capable of reliable detection of select respiratory viruses directly from clinical specimens in 3.5 h.","Jannetto, Paul J; Buchan, Blake W; Vaughan, Kimberly A; Ledford, Joellen S; Anderson, Dennis K; Henley, Donald C; Quigley, Neil B; Ledeboer, Nathan A",Journal of clinical microbiology,432,1

This might involve their embedding in the cytosolic leaflet of the lipid bilayer, thus generating tension to induce a lipid pore with radially arranged lipids forming the wall. Alternatively, Bax proteins might comprise part of the pore wall. However, there is no unambiguous structural evidence for either hypothesis. Using NMR, we determined a high-resolution structure of the Bax core region, revealing a dimer with the nonpolar surface covering the lipid bilayer edge and the polar surface exposed to water. The dimer tilts from the bilayer normal, not only maximizing nonpolar interactions with lipid tails but also creating polar interactions between charged residues and lipid heads. Structure-guided mutations demonstrate the importance of both types of protein-lipid interactions in Bax pore assembly and core dimer configuration. Therefore, the Bax core dimer forms part of the proteolipid pore wall to permeabilize mitochondria.","Lv, Fujiao; Qi, Fei; Zhang, Zhi; Wen, Maorong; Kale, Justin; Piai, Alessandro; Du, Lingyu; Wang, Shuqing; Zhou, Liujuan; Yang, Yaqing; Wu, Bin; Liu, Zhijun; Del Rosario, Juan; Pogmore, Justin; Chou, James J; Andrews, David W; Lin, Jialing; OuYang, Bo",The EMBO journal,432,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS A decision analytic model incorporating Markov process was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding against conventional medical management (CMM). In the model, patients could undergo surgery, or experience post-surgery complications, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or die. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. The impact of different surgical methods on body mass index (BMI) level in the base-case analysis was informed by the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry and the Swedish Obese Subject (SOS) study. Healthcare resource use and costs were obtained from Belgian sources. A base-case analysis was performed for the population, the characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates in Belgium. RESULTS In the base-case analysis over a 10-year time horizon, the increment in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from bariatric surgery vs CMM was 1.4 per patient, whereas the incremental cost was €3,788, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €2,809 per QALY. Over a lifetime, bariatric surgery produced savings of €9,332, an additional 1.1 life years and 5.0 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and dominant over conventional management over a lifetime horizon. LIMITATIONS The model did not include the whole scope of obesity-related complications, and also did not account for variation in surgery outcomes for different populations of diabetic patients. Also, the data about management of patients after surgery was based on assumptions and the opinion of a clinical expert. CONCLUSIONS It was demonstrated that a current mix of bariatric surgery methods was cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and cost-saving over the lifetime of the Belgian patient cohort considered in this analysis.","Borisenko, Oleg; Lukyanov, Vasily; Debergh, Isabelle; Dillemans, Bruno",Journal of medical economics,432,1

This problem is in bandit feedback, in the sense that at each time only the cost function value at the committed point is revealed to each node. Then, nodes update their decisions by exchanging information with their neighbors only. To deal with Lipschitz continuous and strongly convex cost functions, a distributed online convex optimization algorithm that achieves sublinear individual regret for every node is developed. The algorithm is built on the algorithm called the push-sum scheme that releases the request of doubly stochastic weight matrices, and the one-point gradient estimator that requires the function value at only one point at every iteration, instead of the gradient information of loss function. The expected regret of our proposed algorithm scales as O ( T2/3 ln2/3(T) ), and T is the number of iterations. To validate the performance of the algorithm developed in this article, we give a simulation of a common numerical example.","Wang, Cong; Xu, Shengyuan; Yuan, Deming; Zhang, Baoyong; Zhang, Zhengqiang",IEEE transactions on cybernetics,432,11

Compared to intra-tumoral injection, intravenous delivery of adjuvant agents such as OMBs for radiotherapy offers an attractive means of achieving true theranostic function in a minimally invasive manner via contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), while reducing the risk of injury, infection or displacing tumor cells. However, short intravascular circulation times with conventional DSPC-lipid OMBs may lead to premature off-target dissolution of OMBs with an associated reduction in tumoral oxygen delivery. Prior work on microbubble stability and gas exchange suggests that increasing phospholipid acyl-chain length of the encapsulating shell and OMB size may increase circulation persistence, delivery and dissolved oxygen content. In the following studies, we investigate the effect of two phospholipid shell compositions, DSPC (C18:0) and DBPC (C22:0), as well as three size distributions (0.5-2 µm, 2-10 µm and polydisperse) on OMB circulation persistence utilizing CEUS in the kidneys of live C57B1/6 male and female mice, six weeks of age. DBPC OMB formulations demonstrated increased circulation half-lives versus DSPC formulations (2.4 ± 1.0 vs. 0.6 ± 0.5 s, p<0.01 for 2-10 µm), as well as an increased maximum intensity by over tenfold (p<0.01). Size-dependent effects remained consistent across both formulations with larger 2-10 µm microbubbles demonstrating significantly increased half-lives (2.4 ± 1.0 vs. 0.3 ± 0.2 s, p < 0.01) compared to smaller 0.5-2 µm formulations of DBPC. These studies indicate that DBPC 2-10 µm OMBs may be improved adjuvant agents for radiotherapy with significant potential for CEUS interrogation.","Reusser, Traci D; Song, Kang-Ho; Ramirez, David; Benninger, Richard Kp; Papadopoulou, Virginie; Borden, Mark A",Nanotheranostics,432,16

Methods A total of 262 COVID-19 patients discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020 were enrolled into this study. RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to disease severity, and the characterization at re-admission was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were measured, and all patients were followed up for at least 14 days, with a cutoff date of March 10, 2020. Results A total of 14.5% of RP patients were detected. These patients were characterized as young and displayed mild and moderate conditions compared to NRP patients while no severe patients were RP. RP patients displayed fewer symptoms but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization compared to NRP patients. Upon hospital readmission, these patients showed no obvious symptoms or disease progression. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for viral RNA and showed no suspicious symptoms. Eighteen out of 24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested positive for viral RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting that these patients were potential carriers of the virus after recovery from COVID-19. Conclusions Our results indicated that young patients, with a mild diagnosis of COVID-19 are more likely to display RP status after discharge. These patients show no obvious symptoms or disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients. Our findings provide information and evidence for the management of convalescent COVID-19 patients.","An, Jianghong; Liao, Xuejiao; Xiao, Tongyang; Qian, Shen; Yuan, Jing; Ye, Haocheng; Qi, Furong; Shen, Chengguang; Wang, Lifei; Liu, Yang; Cheng, Xiaoya; Li, Na; Cai, Qingxian; Wang, Fang; Chen, Jun; Li, Guojun; Cai, Qiu'e; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Yunfang; Zhang, Feng; Fu, Yang; He, Qing; Tan, Xiaohua; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Zheng",Annals of translational medicine,432,1

We have previously reported the Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale, which uses accessible predictors including aneurysm-specific factors (size, rupture, and intraluminal thrombosis) and treatment-related features (treatment modality and immediate angiographic result) to predict retreatment risk after endovascular therapy. OBJECTIVE To assess the external validity of the Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale. METHODS External validity was assessed in independent cohorts from 4 centers in the United States and Canada where endovascular and open neurovascular procedures are performed, and in a multicenter cohort of 1543 patients. Probability of retreatment stratified by risk score was derived for each center and the combined multicenter cohort. RESULTS Despite moderate variability in retreatment rate among centers (29.5%, 9.9%, 9.6%, 26.3%, 19.7%, and 18.3%), the Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale demonstrated good predictive value with C-statistics of 0.799, 0.943, 0.780, 0.695, 0.755, and 0.719 for each center and the combined cohort, respectively. Probability of retreatment stratified by risk score for the combined cohort is as follows: -2, 4.9%; -1, 5.7%; 0, 5.8%; 1, 13.1%; 2, 19.2%; 3, 34.9%; 4, 32.7%; 5, 73.2%; 6, 89.5%; and 7, 100.0%. CONCLUSION Surgical decision-making and patient-centered informed consent require comprehensive and accessible information on treatment efficacy. The Aneurysm Recanalization Stratification Scale is a valid prognostic index.

METHODS All cases of ICH that occurred in Dijon, France (151,000 inhabitants), were prospectively collected between 1985 and 2011, using a population-based registry. Time trends in 30-day case fatality were analyzed in 3 periods: 1985-1993, 1994-2002, and 2003-2011. Cox regression models were used to evaluate associations between time periods and case fatality within 48 hours and between 48 hours and 30 days, after adjustments for demographics, risk factors, severity, and ICH location. RESULTS A total of 531 ICH cases were recorded (mean age 72.9 ± 15.8, 52.7% women). Thirty-day case fatality gradually decreased with time from 40.9% in 1985-1993 to 33.5% 1994-2002 and to 29.6% in 2003-2011 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-1.07, p = 0.106, for 1994-2002, and adjusted HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.73, p < 0.001, for 2003-2011). Over the whole study period, 43.6% of 1-month deaths occurred within the first 48 hours following ICH onset. There was no temporal change in case fatality occurring within the first 48 hours but a decrease in deaths occurring between 48 hours and 30 days was observed with time (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.90, p = 0.02, for 1994-2002, and HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.32-0.55, p < 0.01, for 2003-2011, compared with 1985-1993). CONCLUSION Although 30-day case fatality significantly decreased over the last 27 years, additional improvements in acute management of ICH are needed since very early case-fatality rates (within 48 hours) did not improve.","Béjot, Yannick; Grelat, Michael; Delpont, Benoit; Durier, Jérôme; Rouaud, Olivier; Osseby, Guy-Victor; Hervieu-Bègue, Marie; Giroud, Maurice; Cordonnier, Charlotte",Neurology,432,1

Luteolin inhibits inflammation, a complex process involving immune cells that accumulate at the site of infectious or non-infectious injury, with alteration of the endothelium leading to recruitment of leukocytes. Cytokines have been widely reported to act as immune system mediators, and IL-1 family members evolved to assist in host defense against infections. Interleukin (IL)-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) are involved in the innate immunity in almost all living organisms. After being synthesized, IL-1 induces numerous inflammatory mediators including itself, other pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and arachidonic acid products, which contribute to the pathogenesis of immune diseases. Among the 11 members of the IL-1 family, there are two new cytokines that suppress inflammation, IL-37 and IL-38. IL-38 binds IL-36 receptor (IL-1R6) and inhibits several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induction and reducing AP1 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) activity, alleviating inflammatory diseases. Therefore, since luteolin, IL-37 and IL-38 are all anti-inflammatory molecules with different signaling pathways, it is pertinent to recommend the combination of luteolin with these anti-inflammatory cytokines in inflammation.","Conti, Pio; Caraffa, Alessandro; Gallenga, Carlo E; Ross, Rhiannon; Kritas, Spyros K; Frydas, Ilyas; Younes, Alì; Di Emidio, Paolo; Ronconi, Gianpaolo; Pandolfi, Franco",BioFactors,432,1

The aim of this study was to compare post-extubation morbidity and TT exchange rates when using cuffed vs uncuffed tubes in small children. METHODS Patients aged from birth to 5 yr requiring general anaesthesia with TT intubation were included in 24 European paediatric anaesthesia centres. Patients were prospectively randomized into a cuffed TT group (Microcuff PET) and an uncuffed TT group (Mallinckrodt, Portex, Rüsch, Sheridan). Endpoints were incidence of post-extubation stridor and the number of TT exchanges to find an appropriate-sized tube. For cuffed TTs, minimal cuff pressure required to seal the airway was noted; maximal cuff pressure was limited at 20 cm H(2)O with a pressure release valve. Data are mean (SD). RESULTS A total of 2246 children were studied (1119/1127 cuffed/uncuffed). The age was 1.93 (1.48) yr in the cuffed and 1.87 (1.45) yr in the uncuffed groups. Post-extubation stridor was noted in 4.4% of patients with cuffed and in 4.7% with uncuffed TTs (P=0.543). TT exchange rate was 2.1% in the cuffed and 30.8% in the uncuffed groups (P<0.0001). Minimal cuff pressure required to seal the trachea was 10.6 (4.3) cm H(2)O. CONCLUSIONS The use of cuffed TTs in small children provides a reliably sealed airway at cuff pressures of <or=20 cm H(2)O, reduces the need for TT exchanges, and does not increase the risk for post-extubation stridor compared with uncuffed TTs.","Weiss, M; Dullenkopf, A; Fischer, J E; Keller, C; Gerber, A C",British journal of anaesthesia,432,1

METHODS During May 2003 to October 2010, 44 consecutive patients (26 male and 18 female) received curative lung RF ablation for 51 recurrent NSCLC (mean diameter 1.7±0.9 cm, range 0.6 to 4.0) after surgical intervention. Safety, tumor progression rate, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival were evaluated. Prognostic factors were evaluated in multivariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 55 lung RF sessions were performed. Pneumothorax requiring pluerosclerosis (n=2) and surgical suture (n=1) were the only grade 3 or 4 adverse events (5.5%, 3 of 55). During mean follow-up of 28.6±20.3 months (range 1 to 98), local tumor progression was found in 5 patients (11.4%, 5 of 44). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97.7, 72.9, and 55.7%, respectively. The 1- and 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were 76.7 and 41.1%, respectively. Tumor size and sex were independent significant prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. The 5-year survival rates were 73.3% in 18 women and 60.5% in 38 patients who had small tumors measuring≤3 cm.

Notwithstanding, the role of neurologists in COVID-19 is probably underrecognized. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to report the reasons for requesting neurological consultations by internists and intensivists in a COVID-19-dedicated hospital. METHODS This retrospective study was carried out at Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, a 900-bed COVID-19 dedicated center (including 300 intensive care unit beds). COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR in nasal swabs. All inpatient neurology consultations between March 23rd and May 23rd, 2020 were analyzed. Neurologists performed the neurological exam, assessed all available data to diagnose the neurological condition, and requested additional tests deemed necessary. Difficult diagnoses were established in consensus meetings. After diagnosis, neurologists were involved in the treatment. RESULTS Neurological consultations were requested for 89 out of 1,208 (7.4%) inpatient COVID admissions during that period. Main neurological diagnoses included: encephalopathy (44.4%), stroke (16.7%), previous neurological diseases (9.0%), seizures (9.0%), neuromuscular disorders (5.6%), other acute brain lesions (3.4%), and other mild nonspecific symptoms (11.2%).

However, evidence shows that IPF has different clinical phenotypes, which are characterized by a variable disease course over time. At present, the natural history of IPF is unpredictable for individual patients, although some genetic factors and circulating biomarkers have been associated with different prognoses. Since in its early stages, IPF may be asymptomatic, leading to a delayed diagnosis. Two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been shown to modify the disease course by slowing down the decline in lung function. It is also known that 5-10% of the IPF patients may be affected by episodes of acute and often fatal decline. The acute worsening of disease is sometimes attributed to identifiable conditions, such as pneumonia or heart failure; but many of these events occur without an identifiable cause. These idiopathic acute worsenings are termed acute exacerbations of IPF. To date, clinical biomarkers, diagnostic, prognostic, and theranostic, are not well characterized.

These interactions are known as the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The main aims of the study were to evaluate whether renal resistive index (RRI) may be useful as a non-invasive marker in subclinical stage of kidney injury in dogs with MMVD and to compare RRI with SDMA and Cyst C. METHODS Forty-four dogs were divided into two groups: control-15 healthy dogs and the heart group-29 dogs with MMVD (ACVIM class Cc). Study protocol included: anamnesis, clinical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography with measurements of the renal resistive index (RRI), urine, and blood analysis. RESULTS The RRI in the heart group was significantly higher 0.725 ± 0.035 versus control group 0.665 ± 0.028 (p < 0.00085). The RRI cut-off point in dogs with stable chronic heart failure (CHF) under 8 years is 0.775, in older 0.64. RRI was similar in MMVD dogs treated with ACE-I + furosemide and dogs treated ACE-I + torasemide + pimobendan + spironolactone. There was no correlation between RRI and SDMA or Cyst C. CONCLUSION RRI is more sensitive than creatinine, SDMA and Cyst C to reveal kidney injury in MMVD dogs class Cc younger than 8 years.","Szczepankiewicz, Barbara; Pasławska, Urszula; Siwińska, Natalia; Plens, Krzysztof; Pasławski, Robert",Journal of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : JRAAS,432,1

Most protein quantitation strategies assume that multiple peptides derived from a protein will behave quantitatively similar across treatment groups, but this assumption may be false due to (1) heterogeneous proteoforms and (2) technical artifacts. Here we describe a strategy called peptide correlation analysis (PeCorA) that detects quantitative disagreements between peptides mapped to the same protein. PeCorA fits linear models to assess whether a peptide's change across treatment groups differs from all other peptides assigned to the same protein. PeCorA revealed that ∼15% of proteins in a mouse microglia stress data set contain at least one discordant peptide. Inspection of the discordant peptides shows the utility of PeCorA for the direct and indirect detection of regulated post-translational modifications (PTMs) and also for the discovery of poorly quantified peptides.

Considering the possibility of dilution factor in pool testing, an attempt was made to find out possibility of any true positive sample/s in pools with late amplification. METHODS The study was conducted on samples received from various collection centres in different districts of Odisha as well as from patients attending the screening clinic or admitted in COVID ward of the hospital. Nasal/nasopharyngeal/throat swabs received in viral transport media in cold chain were subjected to RT-PCR testing in a Biosafety Laboratory level-2 by including uniform volume of 4 units (samples) per pool. All confirmed and probable positive pools in screening assay were de-convoluted and individual samples tested for confirmatory assay. RESULT Inclusion of an additional criteria of probable positive pool (Ct value >35 with non-sigmoid amplification curve or showing a line of amplification towards the end of the cycle) yielded 39 (15.5%) more true positive samples out of a total of 251 positive samples that would otherwise have been missed if only the classical criteria of positive (Ct within 35 with proper sigmoid curve) had been considered. CONCLUSION The study highlights the importance of considering any indication of late amplification in the RT-PCR test to label a pool as positive to avoid missing any true positive sample in the pool.

The Saudi Arabian authority successfully organized the Hajj 2009 amidst fear of pandemic influenza. While severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was rare, the true burden of pandemic influenza at Hajj that year remains speculative. In this article we review the latest evidence on influenza control and discuss our experience of influenza and its prevention at Hajj and possible application to other mass gatherings. Depending on study design the attack rate of seasonal influenza at Hajj has ranged from 6% in polymerase chain reaction or culture confirmed studies to 38% in serological surveillance. No significant effect of influenza vaccine or the use of personal protective measures against influenza has been established from observational studies, although the uptake of the vaccine and adherence to face masks and hand hygiene has been low. In all, there is a relatively poor evidence base for control of influenza. Until better evidence is obtained, vaccination coupled with rapid antiviral treatment of symptomatic individuals remains the mainstay of prevention at Hajj and other mass gatherings. Hajj pilgrimage provides a unique opportunity to test the effectiveness of various preventive measures that require a large sample size, such as testing the efficacy of plain surgical masks against laboratory-confirmed influenza. After successful completion of a pilot trial conducted among Australian pilgrims at the 2011 Hajj, a large multinational cluster randomized controlled trial is being planned. This will require effective international collaboration.","Haworth, Elizabeth; Barasheed, Osamah; Memish, Ziad A; Rashid, Harunor; Booy, Robert",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,432,17

E-selectin and its carbohydrate ligands, including sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) antigen, are key players in the binding of circulating tumor cells to the endothelium, which is one of the major events leading to organ invasion. Nevertheless, the identity of the glycoprotein scaffolds presenting these glycans in CRC remains unclear. In this study, we firstly have characterized the glycoengineered cell line SW620 transfected with the fucosyltransferase 6 (FUT6) coding for the α1,3-fucosyltransferase 6 (FUT6), which is the main enzyme responsible for the synthesis of sLeX in CRC. The SW620FUT6 cell line expressed high levels of sLeX antigen and E-selectin ligands. Moreover, it displayed increased migration ability. E-selectin ligand glycoproteins were isolated from the SW620FUT6 cell line, identified by mass spectrometry, and validated by flow cytometry and Western blot (WB). The most prominent E-selectin ligand we identified was the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM). Previous studies have shown association of L1CAM with metastasis in cancer, thus the novel role as E-selectin counter-receptor contributes to understand the molecular mechanism involving L1CAM in metastasis formation.","Deschepper, Fanny M; Zoppi, Roberta; Pirro, Martina; Hensbergen, Paul J; Dall'Olio, Fabio; Kotsias, Maximillianos; Gardner, Richard A; Spencer, Daniel I R; Videira, Paula A",International journal of molecular sciences,432,16

In addition, government authorities are currently investing greater efforts in developing internet hospitals. PURPOSE The purpose of this essay was to assess how outpatients feel about online outpatient clinics and to analyze the factors that affect their satisfaction and willingness to return to these clinics. The results provide advice regarding how to more effectively encourage patients to use online outpatient clinics. METHODS A self-developed questionnaire was used to survey 191 patients who had visited the online outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province from January to July 2019. A descriptive analysis was conducted on the collected data, and factors influencing satisfaction were identified. RESULTS The majority of the surveyed patients were young or middle-aged (92.7%) and 42.9% held a college degree or higher. Nearly three-quarters (72.2%) expressed feeling satisfied or better with the online outpatient clinic, with 31.4% of these expressing feeling very satisfied. Nearly all (91.1%) expressed the opinion that the online outpatient clinic had improved their awareness of health self-management . Furthermore, 176 (92.1%) were willing to use the online outpatient clinic again. The results of univariate analysis showed that the main factors negatively influencing re-use of the online outpatient clinic were: failure to solve the problem in a timely manner (χ2 = 8.603, p = .045), the complicated process of online registration (χ2 = 8.322, p = .016), the failure of the online physical examination (χ2 = 8.958, p = .015), and unreliable quality (χ2 = 15.373, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS The participants surveyed in this study reported a lower satisfaction for their online outpatient clinic experience than reported in similar surveys of traditional outpatient services. However, many reported that their health-related self-management awareness had improved after use, indicating that they feel better about the online outpatient clinic. The factors that affected willingness to reuse to the online outpatient clinic related mainly to imperfections related to the clinic and its inability to adequately meet patient needs. Online outpatient clinics should simplify the process of registration, improve functions, and increase service functions such as online examination appointments and follow-up visits to improve patient satisfaction.","Peng, Yao-Yao; Li, Xiao-Ling; Zhao, Shu-Zhen; He, Xiao-Li; Shi, Zheng-Yan",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,432,19

Until now, there has not been any German clinical guideline with recommendations concerning the indications for hysterectomy for benign uterine conditions, in consideration of the available uterus-preserving alternative treatments. METHODS We systematically searched the Medline database in 2013, in 2014, and in December 2015, focusing on aggregate evidence, and assessed the retrieved literature. The guideline recommendations were developed by a consensus process with structured independent moderation. RESULTS 30 systematic reviews and 8 randomized controlled trials were analyzed. Among the study patients treated with either hysterectomy (by any technique) or an organ-preserving alternative, at least 75-94% were satisfied with their treatment. Vaginal hysterectomy was associated with lower complication rates, shorter procedure duration, and more rapid recovery than abdominal hysterectomy and is therefore the preferred technique. If vaginal hysterectomy is not possible, a laparoscopic approach should be considered. Abdominal hysterectomy should be reserved for special indications. In 2012, the frequency of abdominal hysterectomy in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland was lower than elsewhere in the world, at 15.7% , 28.0% , and 23.9% , respectively. Uterus-preserving techniques were associated with higher reintervention rates compared to hysterectomy (11-36% vs 4-10% ). CONCLUSION The main objective is to reduce the frequency of abdominal hysterectomy. Patients should be counseled and made aware of uterus-sparing alternatives to hysterectomy so that they are able to make informed decisions.","Neis, Klaus J; Zubke, Wolfgang; Fehr, Mathias; Römer, Thomas; Tamussino, Karl; Nothacker, Monika",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,432,22

METHODS Data were abstracted from the National Inpatient Sample database for patients with cervical, uterine, and ovarian cancers from 2005 to 2011. Chi-squared and logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS Of 4559 women (median age: 65 years; range: 19-102), 1066 (23.4%) utilized PC. Patients were 24.9% low socioeconomic status (SES), 23.9% low-middle, 23.7% middle-high, and 25.1% high SES. Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance coverage were listed at 46.2%, 37.5%, 11.3% of patients; 36.2%, 21.1%, 18.1%, 24.6% were treated in the South, West, Midwest, and Northeast. Over the 7 year study period, the use of PC increased from 12% to 45%. Older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.11-1.68; P = .003), high SES (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.12-1.78; P = .003), more recent treatment (OR: 9.22; 95% CI: 6.8-12.51; P < .0001), private insurance (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.46-2.25; P < .001), and treatment at large-volume hospitals (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04-1.77; P = .02), Western (OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.61-2.49; P < .001) and Midwestern hospitals (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.08-1.68; P = .001) were associated with higher utilization of PC. CONCLUSIONS The use of inpatient PC for patients with gynecologic cancer increased over time. The lower utilization of PC for terminal illness was associated with younger age, lower SES, government-issued insurance coverage, and treatment in Southern and smaller volume hospitals, and warrants further attention.","Milki, Anthony; Mann, Amandeep Kaur; Gardner, Austin; Kapp, Daniel Stuart; English, Diana; Chan, John K",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,432,20

This paper reports our experiences in rapidly assessing Indonesia's COVID-19 laboratory testing capacity in the early phase of the pandemic response. Through a questionnaire-based survey carried out between 23 March and 2 April, we estimated the daily tests that could be done by the 44 facilities, excluding the national referral laboratory, first assigned to be COVID-19 diagnostic laboratories. The capacity constraints were lack of reagents and equipment, and limited human resources; because of these constraints, most of the laboratories were not yet operational. A major hindrance was reliance on imported supplies and the associated procurement time. Expanding real-time polymerase chain reaction testing capacity, through increased numbers of laboratories and optimization of existing facilities, was clearly the main priority. We also assessed the potential yield from using rapid molecular testing machines in the country's referral hospitals. Even assuming this potential could be tapped, several provinces would still be poorly served by diagnostic services in the event of a surge in cases. Since this rapid assessment, the number of designated COVID-19 laboratories has increased and, by 1 July 2020, was 163. On 29 July 2020, for the first time, the number of specimens examined in a day reached more than 30 000, achieving the WHO testing capacity target of 1 in 1000 inhabitants per week.","Hendarwan, Harimat; Syachroni, Syachroni; Aryastami, Ni Ketut; Su'udi, Amir; Susilawati, Made Dewi; Despitasari, Mieska; Mulyani, Ully Adhie; Sumiarsih, Mimi; Puspandari, Nelly; Indrati, Agnes Rengga; Solikha, Dewi Amila; Riana, Dyah Armi; Wahyuni, Indira Rezky",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,432,12

In the last 10 years, there have been outbreaks of 2009 influenza A (H1N1), Ebola virus disease, and Zika virus. Stigma associated with infectious disease can be a barrier to adopting healthy behaviors, leading to more severe health problems, ongoing disease transmission, and difficulty controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Much has been learned about infectious disease and stigma in the context of nearly 4 decades of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic. In this paper, we define stigma, discuss its relevance to infectious disease outbreaks, including how individuals and communities can be affected. Adapting lessons learned from the rich literature on HIV-related stigma, we propose a strategy for reducing stigma during infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola virus disease and Zika virus. The implementation of brief, practical strategies such as the ones proposed here might help reduce stigma and facilitate more effective control of emerging infectious diseases.","Fischer, Leah S; Mansergh, Gordon; Lynch, Jonathan; Santibanez, Scott",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,432,6

We here report our initial experience with transumbilical LESS for adrenal cortical adenoma by using a single port with a multichannel cannula (SILS port) and bent laparoscopic instrumentation. FINDINGS A multichannel port (SILS port), bent laparoscopic instrument (Roticulator Endo Mini-Shears) and Opti4 laparoscopic electrodes were used in all cases. The intraperitoneal space was approached through the umbilicus. The SILS port was placed through a 2 cm incision at the inner edge of the umbilicus. A 5 mm flexible laparoscope was introduced to keep the laparoscope outside, and surgical specimens were extracted using an Endocatch bag. In addition, as a case control study, we compared perioperative data of LESS adrenalectomy (LESS-A) with that of conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA). We performed transumbilical LESS-A for adrenal cortical adenoma in 12 cases, beginning in December, 2009. All procedures were successfully completed, with only one incision through the umbilicus, and without conversion to a standard laparoscopic approach. Mean operative time for LESS-A was 121.2 ± 7.8 min, which was slightly longer than LA (110.2 ± 7.3 min). For right adrenal tumors, we used a miniport (2 mm port) in addition to a SILS port, and were able to successfully perform adrenalectomy ""with no visible scaring"". Tumor laterality and patient BMI did not affect surgical morbidity in these procedures. Moreover, there was no significant difference between LESS-A and LA in blood loss, analgesic requirement, hospital stay, and scar satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The transumbilical approach in LESS for adrenalectomy is safe and feasible and also improves cosmetic outcome compared with standard laparoscopic procedures. Improvements in surgical devices may aid the further development of this approach.","Miyajima, Akira; Maeda, Takahiro; Hasegawa, Masanori; Takeda, Toshikazu; Ishida, Masaru; Kosaka, Takeo; Kikuchi, Eiji; Nakagawa, Ken; Oya, Mototsugu",BMC research notes,432,28

Little research has compared device-measured physical activity, sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic outcomes between occupational groups. OBJECTIVE To compare device-measured movement (sedentary time [ST], light intensity physical activity [LPA], moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity [MVPA], and steps) across occupations. The secondary objective was to examine whether cardiometabolic and fitness outcomes differed by occupation. METHODS Five bibliographic databases were searched to identify all studies which included working age, employed adults from high-income countries, and reported on device-measured movement within occupations. Risk of bias within and across studies was assessed. Results were synthesized using meta-analyses and narrative syntheses. RESULTS The review includes 132 unique studies with data from 15,619 participants. Working adults spent ~ 60% of their working and waking time engaged in sedentary behaviour; a very small proportion (~ 4%) of the day included MVPA. On average, workers accumulated 8124 steps/day. Office and call center workers' steps/day were among the lowest, while those of postal delivery workers were highest. Office workers had the greatest ST and the lowest time in LPA both at work and during wakeful time. However, office workers had the greatest minutes sent in MVPA during wakeful hours. Laborers had the lowest ST and spent a significantly greater proportion of their work time in LPA and MVPA. Healthcare and protective services workers had higher levels of LPA at work compared to other occupations. Workers in driving-based occupations tended to have a higher body mass index and blood pressure. CONCLUSION This review identifies that occupational and wakeful time PA and ST differed between occupations. Future studies are needed to assess whether patterns differ by age and sex, describe leisure-time movement and movement patterns, and the relationship with cardiometabolic health.

Despite rigorous treatment involving chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, the 5-year overall survival rate of high-risk disease remains < 40%, highlighting the need for improved therapy. Since neuroblastoma cells exhibit aberrant metabolism, we determined whether their sensitivity to radiotherapy could be enhanced by drugs affecting cancer cell metabolism. METHODS Using a panel of neuroblastoma and glioma cells, we determined the radiosensitising effects of inhibitors of glycolysis (2-DG) and mitochondrial function (metformin). Mechanisms underlying radiosensitisation were determined by metabolomic and bioenergetic profiling, flow cytometry and live cell imaging and by evaluating different treatment schedules. RESULTS The radiosensitising effects of 2-DG were greatly enhanced by combination with the antidiabetic biguanide, metformin. Metabolomic analysis and cellular bioenergetic profiling revealed this combination to elicit severe disruption of key glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolites, causing significant reductions in ATP generation and enhancing radiosensitivity. Combination treatment induced G2/M arrest that persisted for at least 24 h post-irradiation, promoting apoptotic cell death in a large proportion of cells. CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate that the radiosensitising effect of 2-DG was significantly enhanced by its combination with metformin. This clearly demonstrates that dual metabolic targeting has potential to improve clinical outcomes in children with high-risk neuroblastoma by overcoming radioresistance.","Nile, Donna L; Rae, Colin; Walker, David J; Waddington, Joe Canning; Vincent, Isabel; Burgess, Karl; Gaze, Mark N; Mairs, Robert J; Chalmers, Anthony J",Cancer & metabolism,432,1

With the rise of the Internet of medical things (IoMT), along with smart devices, the med-tech industry is on the cusp of a home-care revolution, which could also create opportunity for developing effective solutions with significant potential to reduce DFU-associated costs and saving limbs. This article discusses potential applications of IoMT to the DFU patient population and beyond. METHODS To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with implementing IoMT for management of DFU, the authors reviewed recent relevant literatures and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including podiatry, engineering, and data security. RESULTS The IoMT has opened digital transformation of home-based diabetic foot care, as it enables promoting patient engagement, personalized care and smart management of chronic and noncommunicable diseases through individual data-driven treatment regimens, telecommunication, data mining, and comprehensive feedback tailored to individual requirements. In particular, with recent advances in voice-activated commands technology and its integration as a part of IoMT, new opportunities have emerged to improve the patient's central role and responsibility in enabling an optimized health care ecosystem. CONCLUSIONS The IoMT has opened new opportunities in health care from remote monitoring to smart sensors and medical device integration.

All mammals use fever to deal with infections and heat has been used throughout human history in the form of hot springs, saunas, hammams, steam-rooms, sweat-lodges, steam inhalations, hot mud and poultices to prevent and treat respiratory infections and enhance health and wellbeing. This paper reviews the evidence for using heat to treat and prevent viral infections and discusses potential cellular, physiological and psychological mechanisms of action. In the initial phase of infection, heat applied to the upper airways can support the immune system's first line of defence by supporting muco-ciliary clearance and inhibiting or deactivating virions where they first lodge. This may be further enhanced by the inhalation of steam containing essential oils with anti-viral, mucolytic and anxiolytic properties. Heat applied to the whole body can further support the immune system's second line of defence by mimicking fever and activating innate and acquired immune defences and building physiological resilience. Heat-based treatments also offer psychological benefits and enhanced mental wellness by focusing attention on positive action, enhancing relaxation and sleep, inducing 'forced-mindfulness', and invoking the power of positive thinking and 'remembered wellness'. Heat is a cheap, convenient and widely accessible therapeutic modality and while no clinical protocols exist for using heat to treat COVID-19, protocols that draw from traditional practices and consider contraindications, adverse effects and infection control measures could be developed and implemented rapidly and inexpensively on a wide scale. While there are significant challenges in implementing heat-based therapies during the current pandemic, these therapies present an opportunity to integrate natural medicine, conventional medicine and traditional wellness practices, and support the wellbeing of both patients and medical staff, while building community resilience and reducing the likelihood and impact of future pandemics.","Cohen, Marc",F1000Research,432,27

We convened a patient safety summit to discuss ways to enhance physician awareness of postoperative pulmonary complications, advance postoperative pulmonary complications as a substantive public health concern demanding national attention, recommend strategies to reduce the deleterious impact of postoperative pulmonary complications on clinical outcomes and healthcare costs, and establish an algorithm that will help identify patients who are at increased risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. DATA SOURCES We conducted PubMed searches for relevant literature on postoperative pulmonary complications in addition to using the summit participants' experience in the management of patients with postoperative pulmonary complications. DATA SYNTHESIS Postoperative pulmonary complications are common, are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and adversely affect financial outcomes in health care. A multifaceted approach is necessary to reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Identifying a measurable marker of risk will facilitate the targeted implementation of risk-reduction strategies. CONCLUSIONS The most practicable marker that identifies patients at highest risk for postoperative pulmonary complications is the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation of a cumulative duration >48 hrs.","Shander, Aryeh; Fleisher, Lee A; Barie, Philip S; Bigatello, Luca M; Sladen, Robert N; Watson, Charles B",Critical care medicine,432,7

However, the clinical outcomes of recipients at 1-year follow-up have never been accurately compared. We aimed to compare 1-year outcomes of recipients of living donor right liver transplantation (LRLT) using pure LLDRH and OLRDH. From May 2013 to May 2017, 197 consecutive recipients underwent LRLT. Donor hepatectomies were performed either by OLRDH (n = 127) or pure LLDRH (n = 70). After propensity score matching, 53 recipients were included in each group for analysis. The clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up were compared between the two groups. The primary outcome was recipient death or graft failure during 1-year follow-up. In propensity-matched analysis, the incidence of death or graft failure during 1-year follow-up was not different between the two groups (3.8% vs. 5.7% odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-8.95; P = 0.69). However, the composite of Clavien Dindo IIIb-V complications was more frequent in the pure LLDRH group (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.15-5.96; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Although pure LLDRH affords a comparable incidence of fatal complications in recipients, operative complications may increase at the beginning of the program. The safety of the recipients should be confirmed to accept pure LLDRH as a feasible option. This article is protected by copyright.

Much remains unknown about host cells and tissues affected by coronavirus infections, including the hematopoietic system. Here, we discuss the recent findings examining effects that coronavirus infection or exposure has on hematopoietic cells and the clinical implications for these effects. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have centered on SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and mature immune cells may be susceptible to infection and are impacted functionally by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These findings have important implications regarding hematologic complications arising from COVID-19 and other coronavirus-induced disease, which we discuss here. SUMMARY Infection with coronaviruses sometimes leads to hematologic complications in patients, and these hematologic complications are associated with poorer prognosis. These hematologic complications may be caused by coronavirus direct infection or impact on primitive hematopoietic cells or mature immune cells, by indirect effects on these cells, or by a combination thereof. It is important to understand how hematologic complications arise in order to seek new treatments to improve patient outcomes.","Ropa, James; Trinh, Thao; Aljoufi, Arafat; Broxmeyer, Hal E",Current opinion in hematology,432,31

The measure assesses 4 symptom areas, 2 each of internalizing and externalizing symptoms-Depression, Anxiety, Rule-Breaking, and Substance Use-and an optional scale on Isolation at School. A total of 2,444 students from 2 high schools completed the WBI, the Youth Self-Report (YSR), and other related measures. Alpha coefficients showed acceptable internal consistency, with values for the 5 WBI subscales at .83, .84, .78, .79, and .74, respectively. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated consistent factorial validity. Correlations with corresponding YSR subscales indicated good convergent and discriminant validity. The WBI Substance Use and Isolation at School subscales, similarly, had high correlations with subscales from preexisting measures. Criterion-related validity was indicated in significant correlations between WBI subscales and conceptually related dimensions of close relationships. Also examined was the percentage of youth falling above clinical cutoffs on both the WBI and YSR, and findings demonstrated high concurrent validity. Collectively, results suggest the promise of the WBI as a brief, psychometrically sound measure to assess the adjustment of adolescents, along with perceptions of school climate that can be modified toward fostering their overall well-being.

Compared with early phase testing employed by pharmaceutical trials, it is questionable whether exercise-based trials employ the same rigour for establishing tolerated dosage. Consequently, it is unclear if participants are initially prescribed optimal doses of exercise, which may potentially impact on study outcomes. Using trials of strength-based exercise interventions in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as an exemplar, the aims of this review are to (1) identify the proportion of RCTs that use phase I/II trials with dose escalation methodology for setting prescription parameters, (2) determine type and level of evidence used to justify prescription parameters of strength-based exercise interventions evaluated by RCTs, (3) explore consistency and applicability of the evidence underpinning prescription parameters in RCTs and (4) explore if a relationship exists between risk of bias for RCTs evaluating strength-based interventions and the level of evidence used to underpin prescription parameters. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Focusing on RCT's evaluating strength-based exercise interventions in adults with RA published after 2000, the following databases will be searched: Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica Database, Medline and Physiotherapy Evidence Database. For each RCT, we will identify the evidence used to underpin prescription parameters. Both trial and underpinning evidence will have key information about the intervention extracted using the template for intervention description and replication checklist. Risk of bias will be assessed according to Cochrane. Levels of evidence will be assessed against the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and relationships between RCT and underpinning evidence explored and described narratively.

After surgery, some patients present reflux symptoms associated with endoscopic esophagitis, therefore PPI's treatment must be indicated. PURPOSE This study aims to evaluate the manometric characteristic of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) before and after sleeve gastrectomy MATERIAL AND METHOD This prospective study includes 20 patients submitted to esophageal manometry in order to determine the resting pressure, and total and abdominal LES length before and after the sleeve gastrectomy. Statistical variations on the LESP were validated according to Student's ""t"" test. RESULTS Seventeen female and three male patients were included, with a mean age of 37.6 +/- 12.6 years. All patients reduced their body weight, from an initial BMI of 38.3 kg/m(2) to 28.2 kg/m(2) 6 months after surgery. No postoperative complications were observed in these patients. Preoperative mean LESP was 14.2 +/- 5.8 mmHg. Postoperative manometry decreased in 17/20 (85%), with a mean value of 11.2 +/- 5.7 mmHg (p = 0.01). Seven of them presented LESP <12 mmHg and ten patients <6 mmHg after the operation. Furthermore, the abdominal length and total length of the high pressure zone at the esophagogastric junction were affected. CONCLUSION A sleeve gastrectomy produces an important decrease in LES pressure, which can in turn cause the appearance of reflux symptoms and esophagitis after the operation due to a partial resection of the sling fibers during the gastrectomy.","Braghetto, Italo; Lanzarini, Enrique; Korn, Owen; Valladares, Héctor; Molina, Juan Carlos; Henriquez, Ana",Obesity surgery,432,1

Recent advances in technology and instrumentation coupled with a mastery of laparoscopic surgery by some has led to the incorporation of LESS techniques in a variety of complex urological operations. Given the paucity of published data regarding complications, we review the collective experience as well as share our own results and observations. METHODS A literature search of published series on LESS was performed focusing on complications and other difficulties associated with this new technique. The experience with LESS at our institution was also evaluated for complications and means of avoiding them. RESULTS A few complications relating to LESS specifically are reported in the literature. These are generally related to the access site and the ability to manage situations that require added dexterity. Conversion to standard laparoscopy (or open surgery) is rare while insertion of an additional port appears to be more common.

Traditionally, physicians receive limited formal telemedicine training, making preparedness for this transition uneven. To describe challenges to and attitudes toward providing virtual patient care, we distributed a survey to physicians within our system who largely had no formal prior training/experience with telemedicine, but transitioned to routine telemedicine use. Data collected are then used to offer actionable recommendations for health system leaders and medical educators. Materials and Methods: Surveys were distributed to all faculty outpatient general internal medicine physicians working at any New York University Langone Health, New York City Health + Hospitals/Bellevue and Gouverneur, and the VA NY Harbor Health System (n = 378) in mid-2020. Survey items consisted of Likert and open-ended questions related to experience with televisits (13 items) and attitudes toward care (24 items). Results: Telehealth-related challenges varied by site and modality. Primary challenges included establishing a connection from the patient's (98%) or physician's end (84%) and difficulty in the following domains: working with team members (39%), physical examinations (95%), establishing new patient relationships (70%), and taking history (40%), among others. In thematic analysis, significant themes with illustrative qualitative commentary emerged related to technological challenges, new systems issues, and new patient/physician communication experiences. Discussion: Experience differences were rooted in the type of technology employed. Safety-net practices conducted mostly telephonic visits, whereas private outpatient sites utilized video, despite both using identical electronic medical records. As we consider a ""new normal"" and prolonged community transmission of COVID-19 infection, it is essential to establish telemedicine training, tools, and protocols that meet the needs of both patients and physicians.","Wilhite, Jeffrey A; Altshuler, Lisa; Fisher, Harriet; Gillespie, Colleen; Hanley, Kathleen; Goldberg, Eric; Wallach, Andrew; Zabar, Sondra",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,432,4

This study aimed to characterize current surgeon impressions about LESS and to determine the relative difficulty of performing a simulated LESS task using a multiport access device. METHODS This study was conducted at the 2009 Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Learning Center. The 56 study participants were asked to complete pre- and post-test questionnaires regarding their level of training, prior clinical experience, and opinions about LESS. Technical skill performance was evaluated using the standardized fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery Peg Transfer task scored according to time and error metrics. The participants completed three repetitions: conventional laparoscopy (LAP), LESS with nonarticulated instruments (LESS Straight), and LESS with articulated instruments (LESS Articulating). RESULTS Complete data were collected for 45 (80%) of the 56 participants, which included 27 practicing surgeons, nine minimally invasive surgery (MIS) fellows, seven residents, and two allied health professionals. Five surgeons (LESS experienced) had managed at least one LESS case in the preceding 6 months. Participants rated their comfort with LESS as 2.0 ± 1.2 (5-point scale, 1 = very uncomfortable). Compared with conventional laparoscopy, the participants indicated that LESS had 97% better cosmesis, 25% decreased postoperative pain, 18% faster recovery, 97% more demanding, 73% increased rate of complications, and 82% anticipated wide adoption. They all indicated a readiness to offer LESS to their patients if appropriately trained. Peg Transfer performance was significantly worse for LESS than for LAP (40-65% performance decline), and for LESS Articulating than for LESS Straight (44% performance decline). Construct validity for the LESS simulated tasks was supported because the LESS-experienced scores were significantly better than the LESS-nonexpert scores. CONCLUSION Despite the increased technical difficulty associated with the LESS approach, surgeons are enthusiastic about offering these techniques and seeking additional training. Robust simulation-based methods that foster skill acquisition through repetitive practice and verification of proficiency are needed such that safe adoption may be fostered.","Islam, Arsalla; Castellvi, Antonio O; Tesfay, Seifu T; Castellvi, Alejandro D; Wright, Andrew S; Scott, Daniel J",Surgical endoscopy,432,29

Proper selection of the device type and monitoring duration is critical for optimizing diagnostic yield and cost-effective resource utilization. However, despite guidance from major professional societies, the lack of systematic guidance for proper test selection in many institutions results in the need for repeat testing, which leads to not only increased resource utilization and cost of care, but also suboptimal patient care. To address this unmet need at our own institution, we formed a multidisciplinary panel to develop a concise, yet comprehensive algorithm, incorporating the most common indications for AECG, to efficiently guide clinicians to the most appropriate test option for a given clinical scenario, with the goal of maximizing diagnostic yield and optimizing resource utilization. The algorithm was designed as a single-page, color-coded flowchart to be utilized both as a rapid reference guide in printed form, and a decision support tool embedded within the electronic medical records system at the point of order entry. We believe that systematic adoption of this algorithm will optimize diagnostic efficiency, resource utilization, and importantly, patient care and satisfaction.","Farasat, Morteza; Sanchez, Jose M; West, J Jason; Burke, Joseph M; Prouse, Andrew F; Gore, M Odette; Salame, Gerard A; Keach, Joseph Walker; Trent, Stacey A; Haigney, Mark C P; Hogan, Shea E; Peterson, Pamela N; Stauffer, Brian L; Holland, Matthew R; Krantz, Mori J",Critical pathways in cardiology,432,1

METHODS Retrospective study in 200 lung tissue samples from children who had died from severe respiratory infections during 1985-2005. Immunoperoxidase assay was performed to detect the viruses that were most commonly associated with respiratory tract infections: influenza virus A (FLU A), influenza virus B (FLU B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1, 2 and 3. RESULTS Viruses were detected in 71 (35.5%) cases. Most positive cases were observed in children younger than 6 months. In 42.3% of cases, only one virus was detected: 11 (36.7%) RSV; 7 (23.3%) AdV; 4 (13.3%) PIV2; 3 (10%) FLU A; 2 (6.7%) FLU B; 2 (6.7%) PIV3; and 1 (3.3%) PIV1.

We performed an external validation of the Kim model for children under two years old to evaluate whether the model is applicable to this age group. METHODS Twenty-four children were enrolled. After routine anesthetic induction, a continuous infusion of 2% propofol and remifentanil was commenced using the Kim model. The target effect-site concentration of propofol was set as 2, 3, 4, and 5 μg/mL, followed by arterial blood sampling after 10 min of each equilibrium. Population estimates of four parameters-pooled bias, inaccuracy, divergence, and wobble-were used to evaluate the performance of the Kim model. RESULTS A total of 95 plasma concentrations were used for evaluation of the Kim model. The population estimate (95% confidence interval) of bias was -0.96% (-8.45%, 6.54%) and that of inaccuracy was 21.0% (15.0%-27.0%) for the plasma concentration of propofol. CONCLUSION The pooled bias and inaccuracy of the pharmacokinetic predictions are clinically acceptable. Therefore, our external validation of the Kim model indicated that the model can be applicable to target-controlled infusion of propofol in children younger than 2 years, with the recommended use of actual bispectral index monitoring in clinical settings that remifentanil is present.

METHODS Keratinocyte viability and in vitro wound closure were assessed in keratinocyte cultures. Effects of topical TASE (0.5 μg/mL of allicin in 97% ethanol) on acute cutaneous WH were determined in a murine model of acute cutaneous wound. Twelve mice were alternately assigned to the vehicle- and TASE-treated groups (n=6 per group). Expression levels of mRNA for keratinocyte differentiation marker-related proteins (filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin) and lipid synthetic enzymes (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4), fatty acid synthase (FA2H), 3-hydroxy- 3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA), and serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)) were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on day 3 and 8 after wounding, while transepidermal water loss (TEWL) rates were measured in wounded areas. RESULTS TASE accelerated WH both in vivo (40% vs. 22% reduction in wound area, P<0.01) and in vitro (90% vs. 65% reduction in wound area, P<0.01). Moreover, topical applications of TASE upregulated the expression levels of epidermal mRNA for ELOVL4, HMGCoA, SPT, filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin (P<0.05 vs. vehicle-treated controls) on day 3 after wounding. Likewise, TASE significantly lowered TEWL rates in comparison with vehicle alone on day 8 (33.06±2.09 g/(m2·h) vs. 24.60±2.04 g/(m2·h), P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Topical applications of TASE stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and formation of epidermal permeability barrier function, leading to acceleration of acute cutaneous WH. Topical products containing TASE could be used to manage acute cutaneous WH.","Santiago, Juan Luis; Galan-Moya, Eva Maria; Muñoz-Rodriguez, Jose Ramon; de la Cruz-Morcillo, Miguel Angel; Redondo-Calvo, Francisco Javier; Gracia-Fernandez, Ignacio; Elias, Peter M; Perez-Ortiz, Jose Manuel; Man, Mao-Qiang",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,432,17

Cells undergoing OIS express a wide variety of secreted factors that affect the senescent microenvironment termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is beneficial or detrimental in a context-dependent manner. OIS cells are also characterized by marked epigenetic changes. We globally assessed histone modifications of OIS cells and discovered an increase in the active histone marks H3K79me2/3. The H3K79 methyltransferase disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) was necessary and sufficient for increased H3K79me2/3 occupancy at the IL1A gene locus, but not other SASP genes, and was downstream of STING. Modulating DOT1L expression did not affect the cell cycle arrest. Together, our studies establish DOT1L as an epigenetic regulator of the SASP, whose expression is uncoupled from the senescence-associated cell cycle arrest, providing a potential strategy to inhibit the negative side effects of senescence while maintaining the beneficial inhibition of proliferation.","Leon, Kelly E; Buj, Raquel; Lesko, Elizabeth; Dahl, Erika S; Chen, Chi-Wei; Tangudu, Naveen Kumar; Imamura-Kawasawa, Yuka; Kossenkov, Andrew V; Hobbs, Ryan P; Aird, Katherine M",The Journal of cell biology,432,25

Identifying the characteristics of impaired drivers is essential for planning preventive actions. OBJECTIVE To compare drug use and driving behavior profiles of drivers with and without alcohol-related infractions. METHODS 178 drivers stopped at routine roadblocks were assessed by traffic agents who conducted standard roadblock procedures (document verification; request of a breathalyzer test [BT]). Drug use and driving behavior data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Subjects were divided into three groups: drivers who refused the BT (RDs, n = 72), drivers who tested positive on the BT (PDs, n = 34), and drivers who had committed other infractions (ODs, n = 72). RESULTS The proportion of alcohol use in the last year was higher among RDs (100%) than in the PD and OD groups (97.1% and 72.2% respectively, p < 0.001). Lifetime prevalence of cannabis and cocaine use for the overall sample was 44.3% and 18.2%, respectively. Fewer individuals in the OD group (31.5%) reported having been stopped at roadblocks in the previous year compared to the PDs (55.9%) and RDs (48.6%, p = 0.03). However, a higher proportion of RDs reported drunk driving in the same period (87.5%; PD 69.7%; OD 26.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Essential differences among groups were observed. RDs had a higher proportion of alcohol use and drunk driving in the previous year; drivers who fit into this particular group may be unresponsive or less responsive to social deterrence and enforcement actions.","Scherer, Juliana N; Schuch, Jaqueline B; Rocha, Marcelo R; Assunção, Vanessa; Silvestrin, Roberta B; Roglio, Vinícius S; Limberger, Renata P; Sousa, Tanara R V; Pechansky, Flavio",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,432,1

Unlike newly emerging zoonoses that attract the attention of the developed world, these endemic zoonoses are by comparison neglected. This is, in part, a consequence of under-reporting, resulting in underestimation of their global burden, which in turn artificially downgrades their importance in the eyes of administrators and funding agencies. The development of cheap and effective vaccines is no guarantee that these endemic diseases will be eliminated in the near future. However, simply increasing awareness about their causes and how they may be prevented-often with very simple technologies-could reduce the incidence of many endemic zoonoses. Sustainable control of zoonoses is reliant on surveillance, but, as with other public-sector animal health services, this is rarely implemented in the developing world, not least because of the lack of sufficiently cheap diagnostics. Public-private partnerships have already provided advocacy for human disease control and could be equally effective in addressing endemic zoonoses.","Maudlin, Ian; Eisler, Mark Charles; Welburn, Susan Christina","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

They can, however, be associated with unique complications that may require management through adjunctive techniques. OBJECTIVE To present a technical report of a salvage technique used to realign a prolapsed Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) during the treatment of a giant internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm. METHODS A patient in his late 70s with an incidental giant supraclinoid ICA aneurysm presented for endovascular consideration. Treatment was planned using the PED. Following placement of the device there were two focal areas of incomplete expansion and balloon angioplasty was performed. This manipulation resulted in foreshortening of the distal aspect of the PED which caused the device to prolapse into the aneurysm. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to regain distal access, a salvage technique was attempted in which a balloon was inflated in the middle cerebral artery and, by applying traction, the PED was realigned with the parent artery. RESULTS After the PED was realigned, direct distal catheter access was achieved and a second Pipeline device was deployed, successfully covering the aneurysm neck with resultant flow stasis. The patient had no postoperative issues and was discharged 2 days later without deficit. CONCLUSIONS The balloon-anchoring technique was successfully used to realign a PED that had prolapsed into a giant ICA aneurysm. This maneuver prevented potentially disastrous complications and allowed the satisfactory completion of the aneurysm embolization. This represents a useful salvage technique that should be considered when encountering a prolapsed stent.","Crowley, R Webster; Abla, Adib A; Ducruet, Andrew F; McDougall, Cameron G; Albuquerque, Felipe C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,432,17

Dashboard designers often seek to strike a balance between dashboard adaptability and ease-of-use, and in hospitals challenges arise from the vast diversity of key metrics, data models and users involved at different organizational levels. In this design study, we present QualDash, a dashboard generation engine that allows for the dynamic configuration and deployment of visualisation dashboards for healthcare quality improvement (QI). We present a rigorous task analysis based on interviews with healthcare professionals, a co-design workshop and a series of one-on-one meetings with front line analysts. From these activities we define a metric card metaphor as a unit of visual analysis in healthcare QI, using this concept as a building block for generating highly adaptable dashboards, and leading to the design of a Metric Specification Structure (MSS). Each MSS is a JSON structure which enables dashboard authors to concisely configure unit-specific variants of a metric card, while offloading common patterns that are shared across cards to be preset by the engine. We reflect on deploying and iterating the design of QualDash in cardiology wards and pediatric intensive care units of five NHS hospitals. Finally, we report evaluation results that demonstrate the adaptability, ease-of-use and usefulness of QualDash in a real-world scenario.","Elshehaly, Mai; Randell, Rebecca; Brehmer, Matthew; McVey, Lynn; Alvarado, Natasha; Gale, Chris P; Ruddle, Roy A",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,432,30

Evidence is rapidly emerging on the epidemiology of COVID-19, and its impact on individuals and potential burden on health services and society. Between 10-35% of people with COVID-19 may experience post-acute long Covid. This currently equates to between 8,129 and 28,453 people in Scotland. Some of these people will require rehabilitation to support their recovery. Currently, we do not know how to optimally configure community rehabilitation services for people with long Covid. Methods: This national survey aimed to provide a detailed description of current community rehabilitation provision for people with long Covid in Scotland. We developed, piloted, and conducted a national electronic survey of current community rehabilitation service provision for people presenting with long Covid symptomatology. Our sample were the Allied Health Professions Directors of all 14 territorial NHS Health Boards in Scotland. Fixed response and narrative data were analysed descriptively. Results: Responses were received from all respondents (14/14), enabling a national picture to be gained. Almost all Health Boards (13/14) currently deliver rehabilitation for people with long Covid within pre-existing services. Fatigue (11/14) and respiratory conditions (9/14) were the two most common presenting problems of patients. Most long Covid community rehabilitation services are delivered through a combination of face-to-face and digital contact (13/14). Conclusions: Community rehabilitation for people with long Covid is an emerging reality. This survey provides a national picture of current community rehabilitation for people with long Covid. We do not know how community rehabilitation can be optimally delivered for this population. This is vital as community rehabilitation services were already under pressure prior to the emergence of COVID-19. Further research is urgently required to investigate the implementation, outcomes and cost-effectiveness of differing models of community rehabilitation for this patient population.","Duncan, Edward; Cooper, Kay; Cowie, Julie; Alexander, Lyndsay; Morris, Jacqui; Preston, Jenny",F1000Research,432,29

As the capacity for orthopaedic surgeries expands or contracts, allocation of limited resources in a manner that adequately reflects medical necessity and urgency is paramount. An orthopaedic surgery-specific prioritization schema with proven reliability is lacking. The primary aim of this study was to assess the reliability of a newly developed prioritization list used for the phased reinstatement of orthopaedic surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and afterward. The secondary aim was to report its implementation. METHODS A consensus-based, orthopaedic surgery-specific, tiered prioritization list reflecting various levels of urgency was created by a committee of orthopaedic surgeons covering all subspecialties and representing academic, multispecialty, and private community practices. Reliability was tested for 63 randomized cases representing all orthopaedic subspecialties. Four raters evaluated the cases independently at two separate time points, at least one week apart. Fleiss kappa was used to assess intrarater and interrater agreement. Implementation were assessed by surveying both surgeons and the surgery scheduling administrative personnel at each surgical facility within a large health system for any adoption issues. RESULTS Case distributions within tiers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 35%, 14%, 27%, and 24%, respectively. Interrater agreement ranged from 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.69) to 0.72 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.78) for the ratings. Intrarater reliability ranged from 0.62 to 1.0. The highest levels of agreement were in tiers 1, 4, and the subspecialties oncology and foot/ankle. The time from development to full scale adoption and implementation by all orthopaedic surgeons was rapid. DISCUSSION This tiered prioritization list for orthopaedic procedures is both adoptable and reliable during the phased reinstatement of procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and afterward.

However, limited information is available on the effect of biological wastewater treatment processes on the formation of CX3R-type DBPs. This study investigated the effect of oxidation ditch (OD) and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO), two widely used biological wastewater treatment processes, on the formation of five classes of CX3R-type DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetaldehydes (HALs), haloacetonitriles (HANs) and halonitromethanes (HNMs), during chlorination. Experimental results showed that biological treatment effectively reduced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254, while it increased the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and therefore the ratio of DON/DOC. In addition, increases in the contents of soluble microbial product- and humic acid-like matters, and the transformation of high molecular weight (MW) fractions in the dissolved organic matter into low MW fractions were observed after OD and AAO processes. Although biological treatment effectively decreased the formation of Cl-THMs, Cl-HAAs, Cl-HANs and Cl-HNMs, the formation of DBCM, DBAA, BDCAA, DBCAA, DCAL, TCAL and DBAN (where C = chloro, B = bromo, D = di, T = tri) all increased significantly, due to the increased formation reactivity. Moreover, biological treatment increased the ratio of bromide/DOC and bromine incorporation into THMs, HAAs and DHANs except for HALs and THANs. Different from previous studies, this study revealed that biological treatment increased the formation of some DBPs, especially brominated DBPs, despite the efficient removal of organic matters. It provides insights into the DBP risk control in wastewater treatment, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peng, Liqi; Wang, Feifei; Zhang, Di; Fang, Chao; van der Hoek, Jan Peter; Chu, Wenhai",The Science of the total environment,432,31

Given the large number of unpreventable influences affecting adequate caloric intake, further research on preventable influences of adequate EN administration is warranted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether hang height of EN formula, formula viscosity, or flow rate influences pump accuracy and formula delivery. METHODS Formulas of varying viscosities (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 kcal/mL) were infused at different hang heights (0, 6, 12, and 18 inches) and rates (20, 40, and 80 mL/h). The mean percent difference and the bias between the programmed volume, volume reported, and volume delivered were calculated for the different hang heights, formula compositions, and infusion rates studied. RESULTS For all prespecified hang heights and infusion rates, the volume delivered was less than the programmed volume and volume reported; the mean percent difference increased as the hang height decreased. The volume was overestimated for both the programmed volume (14.4% ± 5.5%) and volume reported (12.9% ± 6.7%) compared with volume delivered. The overestimation bias was significantly influenced by differences in hang height as well as type of formula (P < .0001, each) but not by rate of delivery (P = .4633 for programmed volume and .8411 for volume reported). CONCLUSIONS Measures should be taken in clinical practice to ensure adequate hang height of EN. Appropriate hang height of EN may result in more accurate delivery of nutrition provisions to the critically ill patient and subsequently reduce complications related to underfeeding.","Walker, Renee; Probstfeld, Lauren; Tucker, Anne",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,432,16

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the surgical approach on the postoperative morbidities of both minor and major liver resections. METHODS In this multi-institutional study, all patients who underwent open or laparoscopic hepatectomies for hepatocellular adenomas between 1989 and 2013 in 27 European centers were retrospectively reviewed. A multiple imputation model was constructed to manage missing variables. Comparisons of both the overall rate and the types of complications between open and laparoscopic hepatectomy were performed after propensity score adjustment (via the standardized mortality ratio weighting method) on the factors that influenced the choice of the surgical approach. RESULTS The laparoscopic approach was selected in 208 (38%) of the 533 included patients. There were 194 (93%) women. The median age was 38.9 years. After the application of multiple imputation, 208 patients who underwent laparoscopic operations were compared with 216 patients who underwent laparotomic operations. After adjustment, there were 20 (9.6%) major liver resections in the laparoscopy group and 17 (7.9%) in the open group. The conversion rate was 6.3%. The two surgical approaches exhibited similar postoperative morbidity rates and severities. Laparoscopic resection was associated with significantly less blood loss (93 vs. 196 ml, p < 0.001), a less frequent need for pedicle clamping (21 vs. 40%, p = 0.002), a reduced need for transfusion (8 vs. 24 red blood cells units, p < 0.001), and a shorter hospital stay (5 vs. 7 days, p < 0.001). The mortality was nil. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopy can achieve short-term outcomes similar to those of open surgery for hepatocellular adenomas and has the additional benefits of a reduced blood loss, need for transfusion, and a shorter hospital stay.","Landi, Filippo; De' Angelis, Nicola; Scatton, Olivier; Vidal, Xavier; Ayav, Ahmet; Muscari, Fabrice; Dokmak, Safi; Torzilli, Guido; Demartines, Nicolas; Soubrane, Olivier; Cherqui, Daniel; Hardwigsen, Jean; Laurent, Alexis",Surgical endoscopy,432,1

For the evaluation of the proposed device performance, we have compared its internal quantum efficiency (IQE), carrier concentration, energy band diagram, and radiative recombination rate with the conventional device structure. Furthermore, the influence of Al-composition in the p-AlGaN hole source layer (HSL) on the operating voltages of the proposed UVB LEDs was considered. The simulation results suggest that our proposed structure has high peak efficiency and much lower efficiency droop as compared to the reference structure (conventional). Ultimately, the radiative recombination rate in the MQWs of the proposed structure has been found to raise up to ~73%, which is attributed to the enhanced level of electron and hole concentrations by ~64% and 13% , respectively, in the active region. Finally, a high efficiency droop up to ~42% in RLED has been found successfully suppressed to ~7% by using optimized ud-AlGaN FB and p-MQB EBL in the proposed UVB device structure.","Muhammad, Usman; Malik, Shahzeb; Khan, Muhammad Ajmal; Hirayama, Hideki",Nanotechnology,432,27

This study reported the safety and efficacy of particle-beam radiation therapy (PBRT) for the treatment of sinonasal malignancies. METHODS AND MATERIALS One-hundred-and-eleven patients with nonmetastatic sinonasal malignancies received definitive (82.9%) or salvage (31.5%) PBRT. The majority (85.6%) of patients presented with T3/4 disease, and only 19 (17.1%) had R0 or R1 resection. Seventy (63.1%) patients received carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT), 37 received proton radiotherapy (PRT) followed by CIRT boost, and 4 received PRT alone. Prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox regression for univariate and multiple regression. Toxicities were reported using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). RESULTS The median follow-up was 20.2 months for the entire cohort. The 2-year local progression-free survival (LPFS), regional progression-free survival (RPFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 83%, 97.2%, 85.9%, 66%, and 82%, respectively. Re-irradiation and large GTV were the significant factors for OS. Melanoma and sarcoma patients had significantly higher distant metastatic rate, and poorer OS and PFS. Late toxicity occurred in 22 (19.8%) patients, but only 4 (3.6%) patients experienced grades 3-4 late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS Particle-beam radiation therapy results in excellent local-regional control with extremely low serve toxicities for patients with SNM. Sarcoma and melanoma were featured with a greater risk of death from distant dissemination. Patients who underwent re-irradiation had significantly worse OS. PBRT is feasible and safe in the management of SNM.","Hu, Weixu; Hu, Jiyi; Huang, Qingting; Gao, Jing; Yang, Jing; Qiu, Xianxin; Kong, Lin; Lu, Jiade J",Cancer medicine,432,16

In a time of crisis, continued access to and delivery of medication for opioid use disorder (M-OUD) is essential to save lives. However, prior to COVID-19, large variability in M-OUD adoption existed across the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) and it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this divide. For the past two years, our team worked with eight VHA facilities to enhance adoption of M-OUD through a multi-component implementation intervention. This commentary explores these providers' responses to COVID-19 and the subsequent impact on their progress toward increasing adoption of M-OUD. Briefly, the loosening of regulatory restrictions fostered accelerated adoption of M-OUD, rapid support for telehealth offered a mechanism to increase M-OUD access, and reevaluation of current practices surrounding M-OUD strengthened adoption. Overall, during the COVID-19 crisis, facilities and providers responded positively to the call for increased access to M-OUD and appropriate care of patients with OUD. The VHA providers' responses and continued progress in enhancing M-OUD amidst a crisis may, in part, be attributable to their participation in an implementation effort prior to COVID-19 that established resources, expert support, and a community of practice. We anticipate the themes presented are generalizable to other healthcare systems grappling to deliver care to patients with OUD during a crisis. We propose areas of future research and quality improvement to continue to provide access and high quality, life-saving care to patients with OUD.","Gustavson, Allison M; Gordon, Adam J; Kenny, Marie E; McHenry, Haley; Gronek, Julie; Ackland, Princess E; Hagedorn, Hildi J",Substance abuse,432,9

The objectives were to explore intimate relationship experiences of people with SMI, to uncover potential obstacles to the expression of sexuality and to present recommendations for mental health policy, education, research and practice. INTRODUCTION Mental health services worldwide have seen major transformations in recent years through deinstitutionalization programs and more enlightened ways of organizing and providing mental health care. However, in terms of social and emotional wellbeing, issues persist for people with SMI, particularly relating to intimacy and the expression of sexuality. This systematic review may assist service providers to determine ways that they may better support people in establishing and maintaining satisfying intimate relationships and the full expression of their sexuality. INCLUSION CRITERIA This review explored the intimacy and sexuality experiences, perceptions and concerns of people over the age of 18 years who were living with a SMI in hospital or community settings. This review considered studies that focused on qualitative data including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research and feminist research. METHODS The databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science were utilised in the review. The search included studies published from 1995 up to and including February 6, 2018 and were limited to those in the English language. Each paper was assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. Any disagreements that arose between the reviewers were resolved through discussion. Data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers using the standardized qualitative data extraction tool from JBI. The qualitative research findings were pooled using JBI methodology. The JBI process of meta-aggregation was used to identify categories and synthesized findings. RESULTS Based on the thematic findings from the 21 studies, three synthesized findings were extracted from 10 categories and 83 findings: 1) the complexity of individual sexual experiences, 2) the clinical constructs of sexuality and 3) family and partner involvement. CONCLUSIONS Having fulfilling and satisfying sexual and relationship experiences is a fundamental human right that can enhance an individual's quality of life. Being aware of the potential stresses and challenges that having a SMI can have on a relationship and involving partners in the treatment, may help to promote intimacy and recovery. Practitioners can use these findings to guide future policy, education and developments in practice. Further research is required to develop and evaluate interventions that target the identified barriers and help people with SMI to fulfil their unmet sexuality and intimacy needs.","McCann, Edward; Donohue, Grainne; de Jager, Jose; Nugter, Annet; Stewart, Jessica; Eustace-Cook, Jessica",JBI database of systematic reviews and implementation reports,432,1

Detection of AOM pathogens generally relies on bacterial culture of middle ear fluid. When viral culture is used and live viruses are detected in the middle ear fluid of children with AOM, the viruses are generally accepted as AOM pathogens. Because viral culture is not sensitive and does not detect the comprehensive spectrum of respiratory viruses, polymerase chain reaction assays are commonly used to detect viral nucleic acids in the middle ear fluid. Although polymerase chain reaction assays have greatly increased the viral detection rate, new questions arise on the significance of viral nucleic acids detected in the middle ear because nucleic acids of multiple viruses are detected simultaneously, and nucleic acids of specific viruses are detected repeatedly and in a high proportion of asymptomatic children. This article first reviews the role of live viruses in AOM and presents the point-counterpoint arguments on whether viral nucleic acids in the middle ear represent an AOM pathogen or a bystander status. Although there is evidence to support both directions, helpful information for interpretation of the data and future research direction is outlined.","Chonmaitree, Tasnee; Ruohola, Aino; Hendley, J Owen",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,432,1

Advances made in management strategies, such as the institution of 'Code STEMI' and percutaneous interventions, have lowered the incidence of these complications. However, their presentation is still associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and appropriate management is crucial for facilitating better clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS Although the exact timing of a curative intervention is not known, emerging percutaneous and transcatheter approaches and improving mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices have greatly enhanced our ability to manage and treat some of the complications postinfarct. SUMMARY Although the incidence of mechanical complications of myocardial infarction has decreased over the past few decades, these complications are still associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The combination of early and accurate diagnosis and subsequent appropriate management are imperative for optimizing clinical outcomes. Although more randomized clinical trials are needed, mechanical circulatory support devices and emerging therapeutic strategies can be offered to carefully selected patients.","Fatehi Hassanabad, Ali; Elbatarny, Malak; Wong, Jonathan V S; Kim, Angela; Ali, Imtiaz S",Current opinion in cardiology,432,26

Homozygous individuals are likely at increased risk for thromboembolic complications. There are no formal guidelines regarding antiplatelet therapy in the short or long term for intracranial stent use in SCD. The authors describe the novel use of a pipeline embolization device (PED) to treat a ruptured dissecting bilobed/fusiform vertebral artery V4 aneurysm in an SCD patient complicated by tortuous proximal anatomy and the anterior spinal artery arising from the diseased segment. Considerations regarding antiplatelet therapy in this scenario are discussed. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old woman with homozygous recessive SCD was transported to the emergency department and presented with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT angiography demonstrated a left-sided 3 × 5 mm fusiform bi-lobulated presumed dissecting vertebral artery aneurysm, immediately distal to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). A PED was deployed within the V4 segment across the aneurysm. Post-treatment angiography showed patency of the parent artery, and patency of the ""jailed"" anterior spinal artery and of the PICA. DISCUSSION Selecting a treatment method in SCD patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm is challenging and there are no clinical trials comparing treatment methods in this population. The authors demonstrate that flow diversion is feasible in SCD, which has not been described in the literature. Additionally, the case stresses the peri- and post-procedural management of SCD, as well as long-term considerations with a flow-diverting stent in place.","Dmytriw, A A; Martinez, J L; Marotta, T; Montanera, W; Cusimano, M; Bharatha, A","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",432,1

Thus, proper laundering is key to controlling microbes that cause illness and produce odors. The practice of laundering varies from region to region and is influenced by culture and resources. This review aims to define laundering as a series of steps that influence the exposure of the person processing the laundry to pathogens - with respect to the removal and control of pathogens and odor causing bacteria, while taking into consideration the types of textiles. Defining laundering in this manner will help better educate the consumer, highlight areas where more research is needed, and how to maximize products and resources.Control of microorganisms during laundering involves mechanical (agitation, soaking), chemical (detergent, bleach), and physical processes (detergent, temperature). Temperature plays the most important role in terms of pathogen control, requiring temperatures exceeding 40°C to 60°C for proper inactivation. While detergents play a role in reducing the microbial load of laundering through release of microbes attached to fabrics and inactivation of microbes sensitive to detergents (e.g. enveloped viruses). The use of additives (enzymes) and bleach (chlorine, activated oxygen) become essential in washes with temperatures below 20°C, especially for certain enteric viruses and bacteria.A structured approach is needed which identifies all the steps in the laundering process and attempts to identify each step relative to its importance to infection risk and odor production.","Abney, Sarah E; Ijaz, M Khalid; McKinney, Julie; Gerba, Charles P",Applied and environmental microbiology,432,1

For high-throughput analyses of sphingolipids, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the method of choice, offering sufficient sensitivity, structural information, and quantitative precision for detecting hundreds to thousands of species simultaneously. While glycerolipids and phospholipids are predominantly non-hydroxylated, sphingolipids are typically dihydroxylated. However, species containing one or three hydroxylation sites can be detected frequently. This variability in the number of hydroxylation sites on the sphingolipid long-chain base and the fatty acyl moiety produces many more isobaric species and fragments than for other lipid categories. Due to this complexity, the automated annotation of sphingolipid species is challenging, and incorrect annotations are common. In this study, we present an extension of the Lipid Data Analyzer (LDA) ""decision rule set"" concept that considers the structural characteristics that are specific for this lipid category. To address the challenges inherent to automated annotation of sphingolipid structures from MS/MS data, we first developed decision rule sets using spectra from authentic standards and then tested the applicability on biological samples including murine brain and human plasma. A benchmark test based on the murine brain samples revealed a highly improved annotation quality as measured by sensitivity and reliability. The results of this benchmark test combined with the easy extensibility of the software to other (sphingo)lipid classes and the capability to detect and correctly annotate novel sphingolipid species make LDA broadly applicable to automated sphingolipid analysis, especially in high-throughput settings.","Hartler, Jürgen; Armando, Aaron M; Trötzmüller, Martin; Dennis, Edward A; Köfeler, Harald C; Quehenberger, Oswald",Analytical chemistry,432,14

Methods This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study carried out on cancer patients (n = 298). Results We found that a majority of cancer patients were around 50 years old (hospitalized patients [HP]: 49.5 ± 14.9; chemotherapy outpatients [COP]: 49.4 ± 12.7), were female (HP: 74%; COP: 63.5%), and had received education at least up to elementary level (HP: 70%; COP: 80%). Breast cancer was the principal type of cancer (>34%) in both groups (HP and COP). The groups were comparable in age, sex distribution, place of origin, educational qualification, and type of cancer. Among HP, the experience and satisfaction scales of the NSNS showed good internal consistency (n = 235, α >0.9, r > 0.7), while among COP, only the satisfaction scale showed good internal consistency (n = 62, α = 1.00). Most patients' perceptions (level of satisfaction) of hospitalization and chemotherapy services were positive (98% and 97%, respectively). Conclusion An NSNS instrument specifically designed for ambulatory care cancer patients is necessary for it to be useful in assessing cancer patients' perception of nursing care. This will help improve the quality of care in Mexico.The presence of cancer by itself could modify the patients' satisfaction level. Further large-scale studies are required to investigate the patients' perceptions of nursing care using the NSNS on different cancer patient groups.","Rodríguez-Herrera, Cecilia; López-Jiménez, José de Jesús; Del Toro-Valero, Azucena; Torres-Carrillo, Nora Magdalena; Torres-Carrillo, Norma; Godínez-Peña, Carlos Alberto; Méndez-Magaña, Ana Cecilia; Herrera-Godina, Melva Guadalupe; Fletes-Rayas, Ana Lilia",African health sciences,432,1

No obvious migration was found into water for all additives, while the migration into 40% and 95% ethanol followed Fickian diffusion behavior, and could be described by Fick's diffusion equation. Diffusion coefficients derived from the equation were in a range of 10-13 to 10-10 cm2/s and were dependent on the type of additive and solution.","Wang, Yini; Gao, Xia; Liu, Bingjie; Lin, Qinbao; Xia, Yining",Journal of chromatography.

Given news media can increase public awareness and sway opinions, this study analyzed how the media represented the HPL, including expressions of support or challenge, topics associated with the levy, and stakeholder views of the HPL. METHODS We performed a quantitative content analysis of online South African news articles related to the HPL published between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2019. We coded the presence or absence of mentions related to health and economic effects of the HPL and HPL support or opposition. Prevalence of these mentions, overall and by source (industry, government, academics, other), were analyzed with Pearson χ2 and post-hoc Fisher exact tests. RESULTS Across all articles, 81% mentioned health, and 65% mentioned economics topics. 54% of articles expressed support, 26% opposition, and 20% a balanced view of the HPL. All sources except industry expressed majority support for the HPL. Health reasons were the most common justifications for support, and economic harms were the most common justifications for opposition. Statements that sugar intake is not related to obesity, the HPL will not reduce SSB intake, and the HPL will cause industry or economic harm were all disproportionately high in industry sources (92, 80, and 81% vs 25% prevalence in total sample) (p < 0.001). Statements that sugar intake is related to obesity and non-communicable diseases were disproportionately high in both government (46 and 54% vs 31% prevalence in total sample) (p < 0.001) and academics (33 and 38% vs 25% prevalence in total sample) (p < 0.05). Statements that the HPL will improve health and the HPL will reduce health care costs were disproportionately high in government (47% vs 31% prevalence in total sample) (p < 0.001) and academics (44% vs 25% prevalence in total sample) (p < 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Industry expressed no support for the HPL, whereas academics, government, and other sources mainly expressed support.

Forty-four studies were included with 37 (n = 9963 infants) included in the meta-analyses. In general, due to poor quality studies, evidence of the effect of any HM feeds or higher versus lower doses of HM was inconclusive. There was a possible effect that lower doses of HM compared with higher doses of HM improved weight gain during the hospital admission, and separately, a possible effect of increased head circumference growth in infants fed EPTF vs. any HM.

It is also unclear if workers in high OPA jobs benefit from LTPA the same way as those in sedentary jobs. Our objective was to determine whether LTPA and leisure time sedentary behaviour (LTSB) confer the same health effects across occupations with different levels of OPA. METHODS Searches were run in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Public Health and Scopus from inception to June 9, 2020. Prospective or experimental studies which examined the effects of LTPA or LTSB on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal pain, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, arrhythmias and depression among adult workers grouped by OPA (low OPA/sitters, standers, moderate OPA/intermittent movers, high OPA/heavy labourers) were eligible. Results were synthesized using narrative syntheses and harvest plots, and certainty of evidence assessed with GRADE. RESULTS The review includes 38 papers. Across all outcomes, except cardiovascular mortality, metabolic syndrome and atrial fibrillation, greater LTPA was consistently protective among low OPA, but conferred less protection among moderate and high OPA. For cardiovascular mortality and metabolic syndrome, higher levels of LTPA were generally associated with similar risk reductions among all OPA groups. Few studies examined effects in standers and none examined effects of LTSB across OPA groups. CONCLUSIONS Evidence suggests that LTPA is beneficial for all workers, but with larger risk reductions among those with low compared to high OPA jobs. This suggests that, in our attempts to improve the health of workers through LTPA, tailored interventions for different occupational groups may be required. More high-quality studies are needed to establish recommended levels of LTPA/LTSB for different OPA groups.

In this review, we will focus on developments in this approach to blood pressure care which have appeared over the last year in a published or abstract form. RECENT FINDINGS Much of the recent literature in this area is characterized by very large office systolic blood pressure reductions, on the order of 25 mmHg at 6 months after intervention. However, the largest and the most rigorously conducted trial of renal denervation failed to meet its efficacy endpoint. We will review some speculations on why that may have occurred. SUMMARY There is little guidance for the management of drug-resistant hypertension in existing guidelines due largely to an absence of clinical trials with hard cardiovascular outcomes; thus, most of the literature relies on short-term (generally less than 1 year) studies that are oriented toward efficacy (i.e., blood pressure reduction per se). With the failure of the Symplicity HTN3 trial to meet its efficacy endpoint, the entire field of renal denervation is under careful scrutiny. From this reviewer's perspective, this finding seems to be more of a speed-bump than a 'road closed' sign for renal denervation, a prompt to reconsider the adequacy of denervation techniques and an encouragement to continue the search for robust predictors of clinical response.","Townsend, Raymond R",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,432,1

We present practical designs to construct a CDT system from commonly available parts and detail calibrations performed on different fabrics to study their electrocharging characteristics. After confirming the post-CDT structural integrity of fabrics, measurements showed that all non-woven polymer electret and only some knitted cloth fabrics are capable of charge retention. Whereas polymeric fabrics follow the well-known isothermal charging route, ion adsorption causes electrocharging in knitted cloth fabrics. Filtration tests demonstrate improved steady filtration efficiency in non-woven polymer electret filters. On the other hand, knitted cloth fabric filters capable of charge retention start with improved filtration efficiency which decays in time over up to 7 h depending on the fabric type, with filtration efficiency tracking the electric discharge. A rapid recharge for a few seconds ensures FM reuse over multiple cycles without degradation.","Bandi, M M; Ishizu, N; Kang, H-B","Proceedings.

Hybrid closed loop (HCL) systems with automated algorithm-derived adjustment of basal insulin delivery, aims to improve glycemic control without adding additional therapy burden or educational investments. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of HCL system in Latin American subjects with T1D and who received a completely virtual training. Methods: Prospective observational data analysis that included consecutive patients with T1D that initiated treatment with MiniMed™ 670G system in Argentina. Baseline and follow up visits at days 28, 90 and 180 were carried out and data was downloaded from Carelink™ Personal at each visit. Patient training and follow-up were performed completely virtual through video conference. Results: A total of 104 patients were included, age: 32.8 ± 17.2 (range 8-77). Subjects were previously on MDI+SMBG (26%), MDI+isCGM (12.5%), CSII+SMBG (9.6%), CSII+isCGM (2.9%), and SAP-TS (49%). Baseline GMI was 7.3 ± 0.8%.

Shay appears to have been the first to use the term moral injury in a therapeutic context, defining it by reference to how it arose in combat situations: ‘a betrayal of what’s right by someone who holds legitimate authority in a high stakes situation’.7 Litz et al subsequently proposed a wider definition of moral injury, ‘perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to or learning about acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations’.8 This definition has been widely adopted in studies of public service professions.9 The heightened interest in a conception of moral injury derived from combat experience is consistent with some familiar rhetorical tropes of the pandemic: talk of fight, battle, front lines, winning the war and circumstances said to be unprecedented. Patients who have suffered serious adverse events, loved ones affected by the harm done to the patient, and loved ones bereaved by unexpected death in a care setting, often express the sentiments in the paragraph above. [...]there is growing awareness among care providers of the ‘second harm’ inflicted on patients and loved ones by defensive, dishonest, unempathetic or otherwise unhelpful responses to adverse events in care.11 This notion of second harm is most often couched in psychological terms, but when we listen to the ways patients describe it (disorientation, disbelief, a sense of betrayal, loss of trust in institutions and processes for instance)12 the impact is clearly akin to the moral injury that Papadopoulos recognises in other traumatic events. Staff who trust care providers have a normative expectation that employers should provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and that they will provide appropriate PPE.","Shale, Suzanne",BMJ Leader,432,1

The results show how students responded to the emergency procedures and which factors they considered essential in terms of satisfaction and stress. Furthermore, they reveal thought-provoking insights on aspects such as integrating elements of online teaching into F2F instruction, developing various skills in lockdown, and motivation for learning. Our findings are analysed in terms of aspects and factors which are viewed as efficient or inefficient by students in a time of crisis. Thus, this research may contribute not only to better preparedness should circumstances requiring ERT return, but also to a more complex re-evaluation of instructional approach at university level.","Dvorakova, K.; Emmer, J.; Janktova, R.; Klementova, K.",Journal on Efficiency and Responsibility in Education and Science,432,1

Hotspots are products of multiple evolutionary forces including mutation rate heterogeneity, but this variable is often hard to identify. In this work we reveal that a powerfully deterministic genetic hotspot can be built and broken by a handful of silent mutations. We observed this when studying homologous immotile variants of the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, AR2 and Pf0-2x. AR2 resurrects motility through highly repeatable de novo mutation of the same nucleotide in >95% lines in minimal media (ntrB A289C). Pf0-2x, however, evolves via a number of mutations meaning the two strains diverge significantly during adaptation. We determined that this evolutionary disparity was owed to just 6 synonymous variations within the ntrB locus, which we demonstrated by swapping the sites and observing that we were able to both break (>95% to 0% in AR2) and build (0% to 80% in Pf0-2x) a powerfully deterministic mutational hotspot.

How did 24/7 occupation affect the quality of indoor air and power consumption patterns? The mixed method used (surveys and instrumental monitoring) pragmatically detected the variation in consumption, comfort and indoor air quality patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The characteristics initially in place and household predisposition had a conclusive effect on such variations. The starting conditions, including household composition, habits and the way daily activities were performed, differed widely, logically affecting power consumption: 8/12 case studies increase occupancy density by more than 25 percent;11/12 improve thermal comfort;10/12 improve air quality but not necessarily translate in a sufficient ventilation practices;air quality was lower in the bedrooms on the whole;only 4/12 case studies use the potential of passive measures;only one household adopted energy savings strategies;10/12 case studies increase electric power consumption but none of the dwellings was fitted with a renewable power generation system. The conclusion drawn is that, despite starting conditions differing widely, household composition, habits (including performance of daily activities performance) and power consumption also played an active role in the end result. This approach allowed to integrate qualitative and quantitative findings on indoor environmental quality (IEQ), energy use and households’ behavior.

This work aimed to predict the probability of a firm being included in a pharmaceutical reputation index (Merco and PatientView), and the position it occupies, according to its economic–financial and stock-market outcomes and its geographical location. Fifty firms with excellent sales in 2019 and their rankings in 2017–2019 were employed. The methodology followed was logistic regression. Their research and development (R&D) expenditures and dividends strongly influenced them being included in both rankings. Non-Asian pharmaceutical companies were more likely to belong to the two reputation indices than Asian ones, and to occupy the best positions in the Merco ranking. Although no large differences appeared in the firms in both indices, differences were found in the position that pharmaceutical companies occupied in rankings and in the variables that contribute to them occupying these positions. Being in PatientView influenced dividends, sales, and income, while appearing in Merco showed accounting aspects like value in books and debt ratio.","Mª Ángeles, Alcaide Mª Natividad Guadalajara",Mathematics,432,28

Evidence suggests that Pandemic's likelihood has increased over the past century because of increased global travel and integration, urbanization, and changes in land use. Further, evidence concerning the urban character of the Pandemic has underlined the role of cities in disease transmission. An early assessment of the severity of infection and transmissibility can help quantify the Pandemic potential and prioritize surveillance to control of urban areas in Pandemics. In this paper, an Urban Vulnerability Assessment (UVA) methodology is proposed. UVA investigates the possible vulnerable factors related to Pandemics to assess the vulnerability in urban areas. A vulnerability index is constructed by the aggregation of multiple vulnerability factors computed on each urban area (i.e., urban density, poverty index, informal labor, transmission routes). UVA provides insights into early vulnerability assessment using publicly available data. The applicability of UVA is shown by the identification of high-vulnerable areas where surveillance should be prioritized in the COVID-19 Pandemic in Bogota, Colombia.","Prieto, J.; Malagon, R.; Gomez, J.; Leon, E.",,432,11

We analyzed the microbiota of the digestive tract, gills, and skin in mariculture-raised S. officinalis using a combination of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR and fluorescence spectral imaging. Sequencing revealed a highly simplified microbiota consisting largely of two single bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Vibrionaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae. The esophagus was dominated by a single ASV of the genus Vibrio. Imaging revealed bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae distributed in a discrete layer that lines the esophagus. This Vibrio was also the primary ASV found in the microbiota of the stomach, cecum, and intestine, but occurred at lower abundance as determined by qPCR and was found only scattered in the lumen rather than in a discrete layer via imaging analysis. Treatment of animals with the commonly-used antibiotic enrofloxacin led to a nearly 80% reduction of the dominant Vibrio ASV in the esophagus but did not significantly alter the relative abundance of bacteria overall between treated versus control animals. Data from the gills was dominated by a single ASV in the family Piscirickettsiaceae, which imaging visualized as small clusters of cells. We conclude that bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria are the major symbionts of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis cultured from eggs in captivity, and that the esophagus and gills are major colonization sites. IMPORTANCE Microbes can play critical roles in the physiology of their animal hosts, as evidenced in cephalopods by the role of Vibrio (Aliivibrio) fischeri in the light organ of the bobtail squid and the role of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria in the reproductive system and egg defense in a variety of cephalopods. We sampled the cuttlefish microbiome throughout the digestive tract, gills, and skin and found dense colonization of an unexpected site, the esophagus, by a microbe of the genus Vibrio, as well as colonization of gills by Piscirickettsiaceae. This finding expands the range of organisms and body sites known to be associated with Vibrio and is of potential significance for understanding host-symbiont associations as well as for understanding and maintaining the health of cephalopods in mariculture.","Lutz, Holly L.; Ramírez-Puebla, S.

Herein we provide preclinical proof-of-concept for the treatment of liver failure through hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes in a large-animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. FAH-deficient pigs received autologous hepatocyte transplantation into mesenteric lymph nodes after ex vivo transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene. Hepatocytes showed early (6 hour) and durable (8 month) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated enough liver mass to clinically ameliorate disease as early as 97 days post-transplantation, with complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes, indicating that the lymph nodes served as a source for healthy hepatocytes to repopulate a diseased liver. Ectopic transplantation of hepatocytes cures the pig model of HT1 and presents a promising approach to the treatment of liver disease in patients with pre-existing liver damage and fibrosis.

The two-dose vaccination procedure, speed requirements, and the scarcity of doses, suitable spaces, and personnel, make the optimal design of such rollouts a complex problem. Mathematical modeling, which has already proved to be determinant in the early phases of the pandemic, can again be a powerful tool to assist public health authorities in optimally planning the vaccination rollout. Here, we propose a novel epidemic model tailored to COVID-19, which includes the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a concurrent two-dose vaccination campaign. Then, we leverage nonlinear model predictive control to devise optimal scheduling of first and second doses, accounting both for the healthcare needs and for the socio-economic costs associated with the epidemics. We calibrate our model to the 2021 COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy. Specifically, once identified the epidemic parameters from officially reported data, we numerically assess the effectiveness of the obtained optimal vaccination rollouts for the two most used vaccines. Determining the optimal vaccination strategy is nontrivial, as it depends on the efficacy and duration of the first-dose partial immunization, whereby the prioritization of first doses and the delay of second doses may be effective for vaccines with sufficiently strong first-dose immunization. Our model and optimization approach provide a flexible tool that can be adopted to help devise the current COVID-19 vaccination campaign, and increase preparedness for future epidemics.","Parino, Francesco Zino Lorenzo Calafiore Giuseppe C.; Rizzo, Alessandro",International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,432,13

Previously, we found that viremia caused by avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV‐J) was eliminated by 21 days post infection (DPI), accompanied by increased CD8+ T cell ratio in PBLs and low antibody levels. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBLs in ALV-J infected and control chickens at 21 DPI to determine chicken PBL subsets and their specific molecular and cellular characteristics, before and after viral infection. Eight cell clusters and their potential marker genes were identified in chicken PBLs. T cell populations (clusters 6 and 7) had the strongest response to ALV-J infection at 21 DPI, based on detection of the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). T cell populations of clusters 6 and 7 could be further divided into four subsets: activated CD4+ T cells (cluster A0), Th1-like cells (cluster A2), Th2-like cells (cluster A1), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Hallmark genes for each T cell subset response to viral infection were initially identified. Furthermore, pseudotime analysis results suggested that chicken CD4+ T cells could potentially differentiate into Th1-like and Th2-like cells. Moreover, ALV-J infection probably induced CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1-like cells in which the most immune related DEGs were detected. With respect to the control group, ALV-J infection also had an obvious impact on PBL cell composition. B cells showed inconspicuous response and their numbers decreased in PBLs of the ALV-J infected chickens at 21 DPI. Percentages of cytotoxic Th1-like cells and CD8+ T cells were increased in the T cell population of PBLs from ALV-J infected chicken, which were potentially key mitigating factors against ALV-J infection. More importantly, our results provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles of chicken PBL subsets for a systems-level understanding of their function in homeostatic condition as well as in response to viral infection.","Dai, Manman; Feng, Min; Li, Ziwei; Chen, Weisan; Liao, Ming",bioRxiv,432,29

Method: Students' perceived knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward telepractice were examined through an online questionnaire that contained 23 questions, including five demographic questions and 18 Likert scale questions. Participants were 189 graduate students (96% female, 60% first-year graduate students) currently enrolled in speech-language pathology graduate programs. Statistical analyses on students' responses, including independent-samples t tests and correlations, were conducted. Results: Only 20% of respondents stated they had provided services via telepractice. Most participants reported slightly more confidence in their perceived skills related to telepractice as compared to their perceived knowledge of telepractice. Students who had prior experience with telepractice were more likely to provide higher ratings compared to those with no experience. Higher ratings of perceived telepractice knowledge and skills were observed for second-year and third-year graduate students compared to first-year students. Positive correlations were observed between students' higher confidence in perceived knowledge and skills related to telepractice and their attitudes toward the service delivery model. Despite positive responses related to perceived telepractice knowledge and skills, the majority of participants reported preferring in-person services over telepractice. Conclusions: Taken together, results of this study demonstrate there is an ongoing need for additional telepractice training programs in speech-language pathology focusing on areas in which students feel least comfortable.

The central event in the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis is the conversion of tachyzoites into encysted bradyzoites. A novel approach to analyze the structure of in vivo-derived tissue cysts may be the increasingly used computational image analysis. The objective of this study was to quantify the geometrical complexity of T. gondii cysts by morphological, particle, and fractal analysis, as well as to determine if and how it is impacted by parasite strain, cyst age, and host factors. Analyses were performed on 31 images of T. gondii brain cysts of four type-2 strains (the reference Me49 strain and three local isolates, named BGD1, BGD14, and BGD26) using ImageJ software package. The parameters of interest included diameter, circularity, relative particle count (RPC), fractal dimension (FD), lacunarity, and packing density (PD). Although cyst diameter varied widely, its negative correlation with RPC was observed. Circularity was remarkably close to 1, indicating that the shape of the brain cysts was a perfect circle. RPC, FD, and PD did not vary among cysts of different strains, age, and derived from mice of different genetic background. Conversely, lacunarity, which is a measure of heterogeneity, was significantly lower for BGD1 strain vs. all other strains, and higher for Me49 vs. BGD14 and BGD26, but did not differ among Me49 cysts of different age, and derived from genetically different mice. This study is the first application of fractal analysis in describing the structural complexity of T. gondii cysts. Despite all the differences among the analyzed cysts, most parameters remained conserved. Fractal analysis is a novel and widely accessible approach, which along with particle analysis may be applied to gain further insight into T. gondii cyst morphology.","Bauman, Neda; Ilić, Andjelija; Lijeskić, Olivera; Uzelac, Aleksandra; Klun, Ivana; Srbljanović, Jelena; Ćirković, Vladimir; Bobić, Branko; Štajner, Tijana; Djurković-Djaković, Olgica",bioRxiv,432,24

To this aim, this study provides a differentiation of car usage before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. Furthermore, insights into structural changes of car usage in private households based on German Mobility Panel data are presented. The results show that during the COVID-19 pandemic car usage was affected, and overall mileage decreased. Especially newer cars with large cubic capacity show a large decrease in mileage by 39 % between 2019 and 2020.

The majority of PLWH but not HIV negative participants showed CD8 T cell expansion above the normal range post-SARS-CoV-2. Yet, in participants with HIV suppressed by antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD8 expansion was associated with milder COVID-19 disease. There were multiple differences in T cell, B cell, and natural killer cell correlations in PLWH compared to HIV negative participants, including lower tissue homing CXCR3+ CD8 T cells in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PLWH but not HIV negative and a pronounced early antibody secreting cell (ASC) expansion in HIV negative but not PLWH. These changes were COVID-19 associated: low CXCR3 correlated with increased COVID-19 disease severity across groups, and high ASC correlated with increased disease severity in HIV negative participants and waned when SARS-CoV-2 was cleared. Despite the altered response of immune cell subsets, COVID-19 disease in PLWH was mostly mild and similar to HIV negative participants. This likely reflects the heterogeneity of an effective COVID-19 immune response. Whether the differences in immune cell dynamics in PLWH will lead to different long-term consequences or compromise vaccination is yet to be determined.","Karim, Farina; Gazy, Inbal; Cele, Sandile; Zungu, Yenzekile; Krause, Robert; Bernstein, Mallory; Ganga, Yashica; Rodel, Hylton; Mthabela, Ntombifuthi; Mazibuko, Matilda; Khan, Khadija; Muema, Daniel; Ramjit, Dirhona; Lustig, Gila; Ndung039, Thumbi; Hanekom, Willem; Gosnell, Bernadett I; Team, COMMIT-KZN; Wong, Emily; Oliveira, Tulio de; Moosa, Mahomed-Yunus S; Leslie, Alasdair; Kloverpris, Henrik; Sigal, Alex",,432,17

Materials and Methods: Morphologic criteria such as hemorrhage, cysts, pattern of contrast enhancement and location were reported in 200 consecutive patients with brain metastases/primary CNS lymphomas. FA and ADC values were measured in regions of interest (ROIs) placed in the contrast-enhancing tumor part, the necrosis and the non-enhancing peritumoral region (NEPTR). Differences between histopathological subtypes of metastases were analyzed using non-parametric tests, decision trees and hierarchical clustering analysis. Results: Significant differences were found in morphologic criteria such as hemorrhage or pattern of contrast enhancement. In diffusion measurements, significant differences between the different tumor entities were only found in ADC analyzed in the contrast-enhancing tumor part. Among single tumor entities, primary CNS lymphomas showed significantly lower median ADC values in the contrast-enhancing tumor part (ADClymphoma 0.92 [0.83 - 1.07] vs. ADCno_lymphoma 1.35 [1.10 - 1.64] P = 0.001). Further differentiation between types of metastases was not possible using FA and ADC. Conclusion: There were morphologic differences among the main subtypes of brain metastases/CNS lymphomas. However, due to a high variability of common types of metastases and low specificity, prospective differentiation remained challenging. DTI including FA and ADC was not a reliable tool for differentiation between different histopathological subtypes of brain metastases except for CNS lymphomas showing lower ADC values. Biopsy, surgery and staging remain essential for diagnosis.

Smoking cessation before surgery reduces complications; however, information on the risks of smoking and benefits of quitting on surgical outcomes are not regularly provided to patients. It is especially important for smokers to quit now because they are at increased risk of serious complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this project was to develop and implement a program for smoking cessation in a preanesthesia clinic associated with a southwestern medical center to increase motivation to quit smoking. The evidence-based program involved development of a provider toolkit, a referral process, provider education, and program evaluation. After provider education, the program commenced. Of the 134 current smokers encountered over a 16-week period, most were ready to quit within 30 days (n = 92, 68.66%). Of the smokers who were ready to quit, 50 (37.31%) accepted referral for smoking cessation counseling, treatment, or both. Only 13 (9.70%) of the 134 smokers were already receiving treatment. This program enabled providers to feel more comfortable discussing the implications of smoking, advising smokers to quit, providing education materials, and offering referral services at the appropriate stage of readiness for behavior change.","Etteldorf, James R; Robertson, Sue; Taha, Asma",AANA journal,432,28

This suggests that the development of psychopathology is not only limited to the brain, but rather involves an additional systemic aspect, accounting for the large body of evidence demonstrating co-presentation of mental illness with chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. Studies have shown that inflammatory processes underlie the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, with recent studies revealing not only correlative, but causative relationships between the immune system and psychopathology. Lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise may influence psychopathology, and this may occur via a bidirectional relationship. Mental illness may prevent health-seeking behaviours such as failing to maintain a balanced diet, whilst adopting a 'healthy' diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fish alongside nutritional supplementation correlates with a reduction in psychiatric symptoms in patients. Obesity and the gut microbiome have proven to be further factors which play an important role in inflammatory signalling and the development of psychiatric symptoms. In a related paper we focus on the role of exercise (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health (Venkatesh et al. 2020). Lifestyle modifications which target diet and nutrition may prove therapeutically beneficial for many patients, especially in treatment-resistant subgroups. The current evidence base provides equivocal evidence, however future studies will prove significant, as this is a highly attractive therapeutic avenue, due to its cost efficacy, low side effect profile and preventative potential. By promoting lifestyle changes and addressing the limitations and barriers to adoption, these therapies may prove revolutionary for mental health conditions.","Edirappuli, Shantal D; Venkatesh, Ashwin; Zaman, Rashid",Psychiatria Danubina,432,28

This study was undertaken to further unravel the RNA-cleaving properties of APE1. Here, we show that APE1 cleaves RNA in the absence of divalent metal ions and, at 2 mM, Zn(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), or Co(2+) inhibited the endoribonuclease activity of APE1. APE1 is able to cleave CD44 mRNA, microRNAs (miR-21, miR-10b), and three RNA components of SARS-corona virus (orf1b, orf3, spike) suggesting that, when challenged, it can cleave any RNAs in vitro. APE1 does not cleave strong doublestranded regions of RNA and it has a strong preference for 3' of pyrimidine, especially towards UA, CA, and UG sites at single-stranded or weakly paired regions. It also cleaves RNA weakly at UC, CU, AC, and AU sites in single-stranded or weakly paired regions. Finally, we found that APE1 can reduce the ability of the Dicer enzyme to process premiRNAs in vitro. Overall, this study has revealed some previously unknown biochemical properties of APE1 which has implications for its role in vivo.","Kim, Wan-Cheol; King, Dustin; Lee, Chow H",International journal of biochemistry and molecular biology,432,4

The S1 gene encoding sigmaC protein of an avian reovirus (ARV) was amplified by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The amplified product was cloned into a plant-expression vector, pE1857, with a strong promoter for expression. The resulting construct with the BAR gene cassette for bialaphos selection was designated rpE-sigmaC and was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation. Agrobacterium containing the rpE-sigmaC constructs that transform A. thaliana and transgenic plants were selected using bialaphos selection. The presence of S1 transcript in plants and their relative level of expression were determined by real time RT-PCR. Western blot analysis further confirmed the presence of sigmaC protein in the plants. Transgenic lines with high levels of sigmaC protein were selected for immunization experiments using specific-pathogen free chickens. Recombinant sigmaC protein produced in plants induced a variety of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in chickens. Recombinant protein administered either subcutaneously or orally in birds showed significant protection against challenge. Results suggested that the recombinant sigmaC protein produced in plants has the potential for large-scale vaccination against ARV in commercial poultry.","Wu, Hongzhuan; Scissum-Gunn, Karyn; Singh, Narendra K; Giambrone, Joseph J",Avian diseases,432,1

However, discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV revealed that highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs) can evolve. The identification and characterization of new HCoVs is, therefore, an important task. Recently, a HCoV termed NL63 was discovered in patients with respiratory tract illness. Here, cell tropism and receptor usage of HCoV-NL63 were analyzed. The NL63 spike (S) protein mediated infection of different target cells compared with the closely related 229E-S protein but facilitated entry into cells known to be permissive to SARS-CoV-S-driven infection. An analysis of receptor engagement revealed that NL63-S binds angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 uses ACE2 as a receptor for infection of target cells. Potent neutralizing activity directed against NL63- but not 229E-S protein was detected in virtually all sera from patients 8 years of age or older, suggesting that HCoV-NL63 infection of humans is common and usually acquired during childhood. Here, we show that SARS-CoV shares its receptor ACE2 with HCoV-NL63. Because the two viruses differ dramatically in their ability to induce disease, analysis of HCoV-NL63 might unravel pathogenicity factors in SARS-CoV. The frequent HCoV-NL63 infection of humans suggests that highly pathogenic variants have ample opportunity to evolve, underlining the need for vaccines against HCoVs.","Hofmann, Heike; Pyrc, Krzysztof; van der Hoek, Lia; Geier, Martina; Berkhout, Ben; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,432,1

Since the original discovery of the classical JAK (Janus activated kinase)-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway of signalling, it has become clear that the coordination and cooperation of multiple distinct signalling cascades - including the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 cascade and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase cascade - are required for the generation of responses to interferons.

After reviewing research documenting such intrapersonal and interpersonal hot-cold empathy gaps, this article examines their consequences for medical, and specifically cancer-related, decision making, showing, for example, that hot-cold empathy gaps can lead healthy persons to expose themselves excessively to health risks and can cause health care providers to undertreat patients for pain.","Loewenstein, George","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",432,16

A consensus of the Working group on CardioPulmonary Resuscitation of the Hellenic Society of Cardiology,17.91552,7.8786,2020,"BACKGROUND Since the late 1940s, corticosteroids have been a mainstay class of agents in multiple interventional techniques and intra-articular injections. Exogenous glucocorticoids are structurally and pharmacologically similar to the endogenous hormones. As such, multiple actions of corticosteroids are exhibited, including those of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Epidural injections, with or without steroids, have been extensively used throughout the world. There are reports of epidural injections starting in 1901, with steroids being added to the local anesthetic since 1952, when steroids were administered into the sacral foramen. PURPOSE Due to the extensive side effects of steroids in various injections, some have proposed limiting their use in epidurals and intraarticular injections. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the multiple side effects of the steroids have elevated the level of concern and recommendations have been made to utilize local anesthetic alone or the lowest dose of steroids. Fashioned from common expressions of the day, the term ""steroid distancing"" began to be used and proposed for intraarticular injections of the knee. Consequently, we sought to evaluate the evidence and feasibility of steroid distancing in interventional pain management. METHODS This focused review of local anesthetics and steroids utilized in interventional pain management for epidural injections, peripheral nerve blocks, and intraarticular injections by multiple database searches. This is a focused narrative review and not a systematic review. Consequently, evidence synthesis was not performed traditionally, but was based on an overview of the available evidence. RESULTS No significant difference was identified based on whether steroids are added to local anesthetic or not for epidural as well as facet joint injections. However, there was not enough evidence to compare these two groups for peripheral intraarticular injections. LIMITATIONS The present review is limited by the paucity of literature with bupivacaine alone or bupivacaine with steroids local anesthetic alone or with steroids of intraarticular injections of knee, hip, shoulder and other joints, and intraarticular facet joint injections. CONCLUSION This review shows an overall lack of significant difference between lidocaine alone and lidocaine with steroids in epidural injections. However, available evidence is limited for bupivacaine alone or with steroids. Evidence is also not available comparing local anesthetic alone with steroids for facet joint or peripheral joint intraarticular injections. Thus, it is concluded that local anesthetic with lidocaine may be utilized for epidural injections, with appropriate patient selection and steroids reserved for non-responsive patients with local anesthetic and with significant radiculitis.","Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Kosanovic, Radomir; Vanaparthy, Rachana; Vangala, Brahma Prasad; Soin, Amol; Sachdeva, Harsh; Shah, Shalini; Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain physician,432,20

The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the cerebral physiologic effects of sedation with propofol versus dexmedetomidine in mechanically-ventilated, brain-injured patients. Using a randomised, crossover, unblinded clinical trial, we enrolled patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Score ≤8) from traumatic injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage or intracerebral haemorrhage undergoing multimodal monitoring (intracranial pressure, brain temperature, oximetry and microdialysis). Patients received an infusion of either propofol or dexmedetomidine for six hours and then a crossover for the subsequent six hours after sufficient washout/in. Clinical and physiological measurements were recorded hourly. In eight patients, (four traumatic injury, three subarachnoid haemorrhage and one intracerebral haemorrhage), the mean dose of propofol used was 25.5 µg/kg/minute while the mean dose of dexmedetomidine was 0.54 µg/kg/hour. All subjects were effectively sedated to a goal of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale -2 and Bispectral Index of 50-70 throughout the study period. We did not observe any statistically significant differences between the groups in systemic or cerebral physiologic metrics. Though differences were noted in cerebral metabolic substrates (lactate/pyruvate ratio), none were statistically significant. In our pilot cohort, dexmedetomidine and propofol appear equally effective in sedating severely brain-injured patients and neither is associated with adverse physiological effects as measured by multimodal monitoring. Larger long-term studies are required to determine whether clinically favourable benefits demonstrated in the medical critical care setting also apply to this patient population.","James, M L; Olson, D M; Graffagnino, C",Anaesthesia and intensive care,432,16

Body composition may be estimated using empirical equations, which include BIA variables or, alternatively, raw BIA data may provide direct information on water distribution and muscle quality. OBJECTIVES To compare raw MF-BIA data between COPD patients and controls and to study their relationship with respiratory and functional parameters in COPD patients. METHODS MF-BIA was performed (Human Im-Touch analyzer) in 212 COPD patients and 115 age- and BMI-matched controls. Fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass were estimated from BIA data, and low- to high-frequency (5 kHz/250 kHz) impedance ratio was calculated. Physical fitness, lung function and respiratory muscle strength were also assessed in COPD patients. RESULTS After adjusting for age, weight, and body mass index, FFM and the 5/250 impedance ratio were lower in COPD patients (P<0.001) and were negatively affected by disease severity. In both male and female patients, the 5/250 impedance ratio was significantly correlated mainly with age (r=-0.316 and r=-0.346, respectively). Patients with a 5/250 impedance ratio below median value had lower handgrip strength (P<0.001), 6-minute walk distance (P<0.005), respiratory muscle strength (P<0.005), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P<0.05) and vital capacity (P<0.005). Finally, the 5/250 impedance ratio was reduced (P<0.05) in patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) III and IV (compared to those with GOLD I and II) or a BODE index between 6 and 10 points (compared to those with BODE index between 1 and 5 points). CONCLUSION MF-BIA may be a useful tool for assessing body composition and nutritional status in COPD patients. In particular, the impedance ratio could give valuable information on cellular integrity and muscle quality.","de Blasio, Francesca; de Blasio, Francesco; Miracco Berlingieri, Giulia; Bianco, Andrea; La Greca, Marta; Franssen, Frits M E; Scalfi, Luca",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,432,16

Injection of 1 microliter 1% lysolecithin into the dorsal funiculus caused a dramatic decrease in levels of MBP exon 1 and MBP exon 2-containing transcripts and PLP/DM20 transcripts. Between 10 and 21 days post-lesion induction there was a gradual increase in levels of expression of all transcripts, which had returned to levels associated with normally myelinated spinal cord white matter at 21 days. These increases in levels of expression corresponded to the appearance of remyelinated axons, detected on toluidine blue-stained resin sections. Foci of high levels of expression occurred in regions of the lesion in which new myelin sheath formation was occurring, although the level of expression throughout the lesion never exceeded levels associated with myelin sheath maintenance in normal white matter due to the asynchronous pattern of remyelination. The changes in levels of expression of MBP exon 2 closely followed those of MBP exon 1. Our results indicate that (i) myelin protein gene expression associated with myelinogenesis during remyelination follows a similar pattern to that of myelinogenesis during development and that (ii) in rat models of demyelination changes of expression of MBP exon 1 and exon 2-containing transcripts are of equal value, an observation relevant to quantifying the effects of putative remyelination-enhancing strategies using the lysolecithin model.","Woodruff, R H; Franklin, R J",Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,432,1

The surveillance of seropositive individuals serves as an indicator to the extent of infection spread and provides an estimation of herd immunity status among population. Reports from different countries investigated this issue among healthcare workers (HCWs) who are ""at risk"" and ""sources of risk"" for COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs in one of the COVID-19 referral centers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia using three different serological methods. Methods: In-house developed enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), commercially available electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), and microneutralization (MN) assay were utilized to determine the seroprevalence rate among the study population. 204 HCWs participated in the study. Both physicians and nurses working in the COVID-19 and non COVID-19 areas were included. Twelve out of 204 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 with variable disease severity. Samples from recovered HCWs were collected four weeks post diagnosis. Results: The overall seroprevalence rate was 6.3% (13 out of 204) using the in-house ELISA and MN assay and it was 5.8% (12 out of 204) using the commercial ECLIA. Among HCWs undiagnosed with COVID-19, the seroprevalence was 2% (4 out 192). Notably, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in 3 (25%) out 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Conclusions: Our study, similar to the recent national multi-center study, showed a low seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 antibodies among HCWs. Concordance of results between the commercial electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), in-house ELISA and MN assay was observed.

This study was conducted to identify the current difficulties, worries regarding the next 2 months, and mental distress experienced by families with children on long-term KRT during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and to deliver possible management approaches to ensure uninterrupted treatment for children on long-term KRT. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A multicenter online survey was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, among the families with children on long-term KRT from five major pediatric dialysis centers in mainland China. The primary caregivers of children currently on long-term KRT were eligible and included. Demographic information, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection status, current difficulties, and worries regarding the next 2 months were surveyed using a self-developed questionnaire. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 were used to screen for depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: Among the children in the 220 families included in data analysis, 113 (51%) children were on dialysis, and the other 107 (49%) had kidney transplants. No families reported confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019. Overall, 135 (61%) and 173 (79%) caregivers reported having difficulties now and having worries regarding the next 2 months, respectively. Dialysis supply shortage (dialysis group) and hard to have blood tests (kidney transplantation group) were most commonly reported. A total of 29 (13%) caregivers had depressive symptoms, and 24 (11%) had anxiety. After the survey, we offered online and offline interventions to address their problems. At the time of the submission of this paper, no treatment interruption had been reported. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has had physical, mental, logistical, and financial effects on families with children on long-term KRT.","Zhao, Rui; Zhou, Qing; Wang, Xiao-Wen; Liu, Cui-Hua; Wang, Mo; Yang, Qing; Zhai, Yi-Hui; Zhu, Da-Qian; Chen, Jing; Fang, Xiao-Yan; Tang, Xiao-Shan; Zhang, Hui; Shen, Qian; Xu, Hong",Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,432,11

Vaccines play an essential role in preventing the spread. However, almost all types of vaccines have been reported to be associated with adverse events. Reactive arthritis (ReA) after vaccination has been reported; however, ReA after COVID-19 vaccination has not been reported. We reported a 23-year-old woman who suffered from an acute ReA on her left knee joint after COVID-19 vaccination and discussed the etiology and preventive strategy. She presented with swollen, painful left knee joint for 18 d. She had been inoculated 0.5 ml CoronaVac vaccine on 0 d and the 14th day with deltoid intramuscular injection. Finally, she was diagnosed as ReA after CoronaVac vaccination and was administered a single intra-articular injection of 1 ml compound betamethasone. The swelling and pain nearly disappeared after 2 d. On 1month follow-up, her condition was normal. ReA after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh its potential risks and vaccination should be administered according to the current recommendations. Further attentions should be put to determine which individual is at higher risk for developing autoimmune diseases after COVID-19 vaccination. More versatile and safer vaccines should be explored.","An, Qi-Jun; Qin, De-An; Pei, Jin-Xian",Hum Vaccin Immunother,432,24

Our aim was to determine whether corticosteroids improve the outcomes of our patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Our retrospective, single centre cohort study included consecutive patients hospitalized for moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15 and April 15 2020. An early short course of corticosteroids was given during the second phase of the study. The primary composite endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation or mortality within 28 days of admission. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the propensity score, i.e. the probability of each patient receiving corticosteroid therapy based on the initial variables. RESULTS: About 120 consecutive patients were included, 39 in the ""corticosteroids group"", 81 in the ""no corticosteroids group""; their mean ages (±SD) were 66.4 ± 14.1 and 66.1 ± 15.2 years, respectively. Mechanical ventilation-free survival at 28 days was higher in the ""corticosteroids group"" than in the ""no corticosteroids group"" (71% and 29% of cases, respectively, p < .0001). The effect of corticosteroids was confirmed with HR .28 (95%CI .10-.79), p = .02. In older and comorbid patients who were not eligible for intensive care, the effect of corticosteroid therapy was also beneficial (HR .36 (95%CI .16-.80), p = .01).

Antigen rapid diagnostic testing (Ag-RDT) is widely used for population screening, but its health and economic benefits as a reactive intervention in healthcare settings are unclear. MethodsWe used stochastic, individual-based modelling to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a long-term care facility with varying COVID-19 containment measures in place (social distancing, face masks, vaccination). In contrast to routine symptomatic testing using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we evaluated the efficacy and health-economic efficiency of single or repeated population-wide Ag-RDT screening interventions implemented in response to surges in nosocomial outbreak risk. ResultsDepending on the baseline containment measures in place, nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 incidence was reduced by up to 40-47% (range of means) with routine RT-PCR testing, 59-63% with the addition of a timely round of Ag-RDT screening, and 69-75% with well-timed two-round screening. For the latter, a delay of 4 to 5 days between the first and second rounds was optimal for transmission prevention. Efficacy varied depending on test sensitivity, subpopulations targeted, and SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the community. Efficiency, however, varied primarily depending on the other containment measures in place: surveillance costs for a combined strategy of routine RT-PCR testing and reactive Ag-RDT screening ranged from a mean {euro}420-{euro}10,260/infection averted across scenarios (default unit costs: {euro}5/Ag-RDT test, {euro}50/RT-PCR test). InterpretationReactive Ag-RDT screening complements routine RT-PCR testing, and systematic two-round screening helps overcome limited, time-varying diagnostic sensitivity. Health-economic gains scale significantly with underlying nosocomial outbreak risk.

Increased prevalence of myopia and new strategies for myopia management have raised the prospect of various interventions, including contact lenses for therapeutic use as well as for refractive correction. More personnel skilled in contact lens fitting will be needed to address potential worldwide demand for these interventions. This review investigates the current status and future requirements of global contact lens education in light of these developments. The COVD-19 pandemic led educational institutions worldwide to move towards online delivery. An online survey among 546 educators, conducted in May 2020, investigated changes to contact lens education delivery before and after the onset of the pandemic. A total of 214 responses were received from 32 countries. Prior to COVID-19 restrictions, 23% of educators had conducted more than 50% of their total teaching online; however, 69% expected to conduct more than half of their teaching online by the end of 2020 and 12% anticipated 90% or more of their teaching would be online. Some 76% of educators expected to provide more online lectures after the pandemic and 63% anticipated new methods to deliver practical education. Around half were planning to introduce new teaching online platforms (54%) and more online assessment methods (53%). The global need for increasing numbers of skilled personnel points to a crucial role for educators in teaching the contact lens practitioners of the future. Contact lens education delivery was already evolving prior to COVID-19, and changes that are currently occurring may lead to permanent differences in the way contact lenses are taught in future. The International Association of Contact Lens Educators (IACLE) provides educators with a standardised global curriculum, online resources and teaching technology that could also serve as a model for wider ophthalmic education in future.","Naroo, Shehzad A; Morgan, Philip B; Shinde, Lakshmi; Lee, Cheni; Ewbank, Alison",Ophthalmic physiol. opt,432,22

An ability to triage patients was needed due to a sudden and massive increase in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare providers incurred an exponential increase in workload,which created a strain on the staff and limited resources. Further, methods to better understand and characterise the predictors of morbidity and mortality was needed. METHODS: We developed a prediction model to predict patients at risk for mortality using only laboratory, vital and demographic information readily available in the electronic health record on more than 3395 hospital admissions with COVID-19. Multiple methods were applied, and final model was selected based on performance. A variable importance algorithm was used for interpretability, and understanding of performance and predictors was applied to the best model. We built a model with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 83-97 to identify predictors and patients with high risk of mortality due to COVID-19. Oximetry, respirations, blood urea nitrogen, lymphocyte per cent, calcium, troponin and neutrophil percentage were important features, and key ranges were identified that contributed to a 50% increase in patients' mortality prediction score. With an increasing negative predictive value starting 0.90 after the second day of admission suggests we might be able to more confidently identify likely survivors DISCUSSION: This study serves as a use case of a machine learning methods with visualisations to aide clinicians with a better understanding of the model and predictors of mortality.

By March 16th, physical distancing and confinement measures were implemented by the Brazilian government. Little is known about how these measures were followed up by the Brazilian people and their impact on daily routine. METHODS: In early April 2020, using an online platform, we organized an online survey among adults living in Brazil about their COVID-19 preventive behavior and impact on their daily routine. RESULTS: Data from 23,896 respondents were analyzed (mean age: 47.4 years). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, half (51.1%) of the professionals reported working from home. Regular handwashing was practiced by 98.7% of participants; 92.6% reported adhering to the 1.5-2 m physical distancing rule, but only 45.5% wore a face mask when going outside. While 29.3% of respondents found it relatively easy to stay at home, indoor confinement was extremely difficult for 7.9% of participants. Moreover, 11% of participants were extremely worried about their health during the COVID-19 epidemic. Younger people, male, persons living in a rural area/village or popular neighbourhoods, students and workers reported less preventive behaviour.

The time period following the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 83% lower odds of employment compared to the pre-pandemic period (OR=.28, 95%CI=0.11, 0.71). Those with a post-secondary education or who reported more mental job demands were more likely to be employed following the pandemic. Also, a majority of participants reported that the pandemic affected health care (83%), treatment access (54%), working conditions (92%) and occupational health and safety (74%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had socioeconomic implications for young people with rheumatic disease. To support economic recovery for people with rheumatic disease, strategies to promote employment should be designed that also account for the young adult life phase and occupational characteristics.","Jetha, Arif; Tucker, Lori; Chen, Cynthia; Gignac, Monique A M",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),432,21

However, the spherical shape of the Luneburg lens geometry complicates the integration of standard planar feed sources and poses significant implementation challenge. To eliminate the feed mismatch problem, the quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO) method can be adopted to modify the lens' spherical feed surface into a planar one. However, Luneburg lenses designed with QCTO method are limited to poor performance due to the presence of the reflections and beam broadening arising from the quasi-conformal mapping. In this paper, we present a new method of implementing QCTO-enabled modified Luneburg lens antenna by designing a broadband anti-reflective layer along with the modified lens's planar excitation surface. The proposed anti-reflector layer is inherently broadband in nature, has a continuously tapered inhomogeneous dielectric permittivity profile along its thickness, and ensures broadband impedance matching. To show the new QCTO modified Luneburg lens antenna, an example lens antenna was designed at Ka-band (26-40 GHz) and fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) based additive manufacturing technique. Electromagnetic performance of the lens antenna was experimentally demonstrated.","Biswas, Soumitra; Mirotznik, Mark",Sci Rep,432,33

METHODS: On-demand telehealth requests made to a large healthcare system in the USA between 15 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were included for analysis with a focus on patients who were defined as left without being seen (LWBS). As part of a pilot program a registered nurse attempted to call LWBS patients within 24 hours of their telehealth request and asked if they were ok, if they sought care for their original visit reason, what that care was, or if they still needed guidance. This information and patient demographics were analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period there were 21,610 completed on-demand telehealth visits and 1852 patients for whom there were LWBS attempted follow-ups. Most patients LWBS for a reason that originated from the patient and not associated with the provider or telehealth platform. The mean wait time for LWBS patients was 12.4 min compared to patients waiting 15.1 min before engaging with a provider to complete a visit. Of the 1852 total LWBS patients in the follow-up programme, 819 (44.2%) were successfully contacted with a follow-up phone call. Most of these patients (63.2%) already completed or planned to complete a telehealth visit, 13.6% indicated they no longer needed to see a provider, and 12.8% planned or already completed an in-person visit. Only 2.2% went to an emergency department. DISCUSSION: Results suggest patients can effectively self-manage their care needs.","Sheridan, Matthew D; Adams, Katharine T; Booker, Ethan; Krevat, Seth A; Calabrese, Mary; Gomes, Kylie; Ratwani, Raj M",J Telemed Telecare,432,22

However, the ability of wildlife tourism to enhance the conservation of less appealing taxa such as bats has rarely been examined. We sampled a total of 197 tourists in Monfort Bat Cave Sanctuary in the Philippines, the world's largest colony of Geoffroy's Rousette (Rousettus amplexicaudatus). Convenient pre/post-visit surveys were conducted to (a) explore the potential of bat-watching to raise tourists’ knowledge, attitudes towards bats, and determine how perceptions vary across demographic classes;and (b) determine potential predictors of conservation willingness among sampled urban tourists. Our study observed an increase in knowledge about bats and 61% of the tourists are willing to support conservation bat protection after the bat-watching visit to the cave site. Tourists’ conservation willingness was associated with age group, prior knowledge of bat ecosystem services, and perceptions about the conservation relevance of bat-watching as a conservation initiative. Our study highlights the effectiveness of short-term engagements such as bat-watching at improving human-bat interactions and suggests such programs should focus on highlighting ecosystem services and benefits of bats. However, it should be noted that we performed this study before the COVID-19 global pandemic and misinformation linking bats to the disease spread has increased since. We expect that public perception will change in the post-COVID-19 period and the conservation willingness survey should be repeated to understand how to counter misconceptions to develop effective bat conservation management in the post-COVID-19.","Cejuela Tanalgo, Krizler Catherine Hughes Alice",Environmental Challenges,432,16

Patients, clinicians and hospital authorities have had to balance the risks to patients of attending hospital, many of whom are especially vulnerable, with the risks of delaying or modifying cancer treatment. Those whose care has been significantly impacted include patients suffering from the effects of cancer on bone, where delivering the usual standard of care for bone support has often not been possible and clinicians have been forced to seek alternative options for adequate management. At a virtual meeting of the Cancer and Bone Society in July 2020, an expert group shared experiences and solutions to this challenge, following which a questionnaire was sent internationally to the symposium's participants, to explore the issues faced and solutions offered. 70 respondents, from 9 countries (majority USA, 39%, followed by UK, 19%) included 50 clinicians, spread across a diverse range of specialties (but with a high proportion, 64%, of medical oncologists) and 20 who classified themselves as non-clinical (solely lab-based). Spread of clinician specialty across tumour types was breast (65%), prostate (27%), followed by renal, myeloma and melanoma. Analysis showed that management of metastatic bone disease in all solid tumour types and myeloma, adjuvant bisphosphonate breast cancer therapy and cancer treatment induced bone loss, was substantially impacted. Respondents reported delays to routine CT scans (58%), standard bone scans (48%) and MRI scans (46%), though emergency scans were less affected. Delays in palliative radiotherapy for bone pain were reported by 31% of respondents with treatments often involving only a single dose without fractionation. Delays to, or cancellation of, prophylactic surgery for bone pain were reported by 35% of respondents. Access to treatments with intravenous bisphosphonates and subcutaneous denosumab was a major problem, mitigated by provision of drug administration at home or in a local clinic, reduced frequency of administration or switching to oral bisphosphonates taken at home. The questionnaire also revealed damaging delays or complete stopping of both clinical and laboratory research. In addition to an analysis of the questionnaire, this paper presents a rationale and recommendations for adaptation of the normal guidelines for protection of bone health during the pandemic.","Brown, J E; Wood, S L; Confavreux, C; Abe, M; Weilbaecher, K; Hadji, P; Johnson, R W; Rhoades, J A; Edwards, C M; Croucher, P I; Juarez, P; El Badri, S; Ariaspinilla, G; D039,; Oronzo, S; Guise, T A; Van Poznak, C",J Bone Oncol,432,16

We study the processes analytically and, using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, show explicit solutions and inequalities in the infection-spreading phase for different processes' effects on social costs.

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 81 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 respiratory infection who underwent MDCT for clinical suspicion of PTE (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, severe respiratory failure (SRF) not corrected with high O2 flow) and/or raised D-dimer. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81). Patients with O2-refractory SRF showed a 6.36-fold higher risk for hypoperfusion on the iodine map. CONCLUSION: By adding the functional image to the anatomical image, pulmonary angiography with MDCT and iodine mapping can demonstrate not only PTE in main, lobar and segmental arteries, but also the presence of hypoperfusion in distal vessels. This makes it a highly useful tool for the accurate diagnosis and therapeutic orientation of patients with Covid-19 lung involvement.","Pérez Dueñas, Virginia; Allona Krauel, María; Agrela Rojas, Emilio; Ramírez Prieto, Maria Teresa; Díez Izquierdo, Laura; López de la Guardia, Ulpiano; Torres Sánchez, Isabel",Arch. bronconeumol.

To aid in the development of diagnostic kits for rapid and sensitive detection of the virus, we evaluated a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques. Here, we compared conventional PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods with hybrid techniques such as polymerase chain displacement reaction (PCDR) and a newly developed PCR-LAMP method. We found that the hybrid methods demonstrated higher sensitivity and assay reaction rates than those of the classic LAMP and PCR techniques and can be used to for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The proposed methods based on the modern hybrid amplification techniques markedly improve virus detection and, therefore, can be extremely useful in the development of new diagnostic kits.","Varlamov, Dmitriy A; Blagodatskikh, Konstantin A; Smirnova, Evgenia V; Kramarov, Vladimir M; Ignatov, Konstantin B",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,432,17
220352,220352,220352,Post COVID-19 sequelae: A prospective observational study from Northern India,17.77003,8.2836685,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the emergency department (ED) definitive diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 pneumonia is challenging as nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) can give false negative results. Strategies to reduce false negative rate of NPS have limitations. Serial NPSs (24-48 h from one another) are time-consuming, sputum can not be collected in the majority of patients, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the most sensitive test, requires specific expertise. Laryngotracheal aspiration (LTA) is easy to perform and showed a similar accuracy to BAL for diagnosis of other pulmonary diseases, however it was not studied to diagnose SARS-COV-2 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: An observational cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the negative predictive value of LTA in patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS. METHODS: In the EDs of two university hospitals, consecutive patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS underwent LTA performed with a nasotracheal tube connected to a vacuum system. Final diagnosis based on all respiratory specimen tests (NPS, LTA and BAL) and hospital data was established by two reviewers and in case of discordance by a third reviewer. RESULTS: 117 patients were enrolled. LTA was feasible in all patients and no patients experienced adverse events. Fifteen (12.7%) patients were diagnosed with community-acquired SARS-COV-2 pneumonia: 13 LTA positive and only 2 (1.7%) LTA negative. The negative predictive value of NPS and LTA was 87.3% (79.9% - 92.7%) and 98.1% (93.3%99.8%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LTA resulted feasible, safe and reduced false negative rate in patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 pneumonia despite a negative NPS.","Nazerian, Peiman; Sacco, Roberto M; Solbiati, Monica; Targetti, Elena; Marta, Chiara; Blasi, Francesco; Casazza, Giovanni; Colao, Maria Grazia; Tomassetti, Sara; Grifoni, Stefano; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Costantino, Giorgio",Eur. j. intern. med,432,26

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort trial conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch Galveston, Texas. All pregnant women presented to our medical center, who were screened and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, were included. We stratified our study population in three groups: asymptomatic, symptomatic not requiring oxygen therapy, and patients requiring oxygen support to maintain oxygen saturation >94%. Relevant population characteristics, laboratory data, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were abstracted. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Between March and July 2020, 91 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to our labor and delivery unit. Among these, 61.5% were asymptomatic, 34.1% were symptomatic, and 4.4% required oxygen support. Our population was mainly Hispanic (80.2%), multiparous (76.9%), obese (70.3%), and with a median age of 27 years. Median gestational age at symptom onset or diagnosis was 36 weeks. Significant differences were found between gestational age and disease severity. Maternal characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbid conditions did not appear to influence severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significant laboratory findings associated with increasing disease severity included decreasing hemoglobin and white blood cell count, lymphopenia, and increasing levels of inflammatory markers including CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin. Maternal and neonatal outcomes did not differ among groups. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected by polymerase chain reaction testing in neonates of mothers with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection are predominantly asymptomatic. Patients appear to be at increased risk for more severe infection requiring oxygen support later in pregnancy. KEY POINTS: · The majority of pregnant patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and <1 in 20 require oxygen support.. · Women in the later stages of pregnancy may be at increased risk for severe infection.. · Anemia, leukopenia, CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin are associated with increasing severity..","Berry, Marissa; Wang, Amanda; Clark, Shannon M; Harirah, Hassan M; Jain, Sangeeta; Olson, Gayle L; Pacheco, Luis D; Saade, George R; Saad, Antonio F",Am. j. perinatol,432,16

To chronicle how biology faculty responded to this emergency remote teaching, we surveyed faculty across the United States in August of 2020. Our survey included open-ended questions to identify a memorable moment, difficulties encountered, and unexpected benefits during the first COVID-19 semester. Faculty responses were coded by two researchers, and 21 themes emerged. Seventeen coding themes corresponded to one of four facets of adult personal resilience theory, and we used nonparametric statistical tests to compare resilience between inexperienced and experienced online instructors, as well as trained and untrained instructors. Experienced online instructors were more likely to describe an act of kindness in their memory but were also more likely to include negative student behavior as a difficulty. Untrained faculty were the only instructors who included student engagement as a difficulty and were more likely to describe a negative, discouraging memory. We used conditional forest analysis to identify polarizing themes between faculty with and without previous experience teaching online and between faculty who did and did not receive formal training. Our results underline the importance of training faculty, including experienced instructors, to improve emergency preparedness.","Walsh, Lisa L; Arango-Caro, Sandra; Wester, Emma R; Callis-Duehl, Kristine",CBE Life Sci Educ,432,24

The pathogen causing COVID-19 is acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the key entry factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Recognizing the importance of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed and presented the landscape of cell-type identities for ACE2+ TMPRSS2+ cells across different human tissues and the age-related alterations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression across different cell types. Additionally, most of the post-acute COVID-19 sequelae could attribute to the ACE2-expressing organ systems. Therefore, these SARS-CoV-2 tropism data should be an essential resource for guiding clinical treatment and pathological studies, which should draw attention toward the prioritization of COVID-19 research in the future. Notably, we discovered the age-related expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the immune-inflammatory stromal cells, implying the potential interplay between COVID-19, stromal cells, and aging. In this study, we developed a novel and practical analysis framework for mapping the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2. This approach was built to aid the identification of viral-specific cell types and age-related alterations of viral tropism, highlighting the power of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to address viral pathogenesis systematically. With the rapid accumulation of scRNA-seq data and the continuously increasing insight into viral entry factors, we anticipate that this scRNA-seq-based approach will attract broader interest in the virus research communities.

Seroprevalence surveys are an important tool to identify not just cases that have come to clinical attention, but all previously infected recipients. We performed a seroprevalence survey of the adult heart transplant program at a large New York City Hospital System. A total of 232 (87% of recipients being followed) subjects were tested, of whom 37 (15.9%) were found to be previously infected. This is comparable to the overall rate of prior infection in the NYC metro area. Disease course tended to be more severe than in the general population; however, this was at least partially driven by traditional risk factors of age and comorbidities. Lastly, 9 of 10 recipients who were initially found to be PCR positive subsequently tested positive for antibodies, confirming the ability of this population to mount a humoral response. In conclusion, prevalence of COVID-19 in heart transplant recipients on immunosuppression was comparable to that in the general population of NYC, and 90% of those with an initially positive viral swab developed antibodies. In those who are infected, disease course tends to be more severe.","Patel, Snehal R; Gjelaj, Christiana; Fletcher, Rena; Luke, Anne; Paschenko, Alexandra; Farooq, Muhammad; Saeed, Omar; Vukelic, Sasa; Jorde, Ulrich P",Clin Transplant,432,29

In this scenario, gardening activities have been identified as a plausible tool to buffer the mental health consequences of forced home confinement. In this paper, we investigate the relation between gardening and psychopathological distress during the lockdown of the first wave of Covid-19 in Italy. It is hypothesized that engagement in gardening activities promotes psychological health, through a reduction of Covid-related stress. An online survey was administered through sharing using social media to N = 303 participants during the March-May 2020 lockdown in Italy, measuring Covid-19 related distress, psychopathological distress, engagement in gardening activities plus a series of socio-demographic and residential covariates. As expected, a mediation model tested using a bootstrapping procedure showed that gardening is related to lower psychopathological distress through decreased Covid-19 related distress. Interestingly, results also showed that psychopathological distress was higher for women and unmarried respondents, and negatively associated with age and square meters per person at home. The theoretical and practical implications for social policies contrasting the Covid-19 pandemic are discussed.","Theodorou, A.; Panno, A.; Carrus, G.; Carbone, G.

First, we are dealing with time-series data. Typical time-series data describe behavior of a single object over time. In medical data, we are dealing with time-series data belonging to multiple entities. Thus, there may be multiple subsets of records such that records in each subset, which belong to a single entity are temporally dependent, but the records in different subsets are unrelated. Moreover, the records in a subset contain different types of attributes, some of which must be grouped in a particular manner to make the analysis meaningful. Anomaly detection techniques need to be customized for time-series data belonging to multiple entities. Second, anomaly detection techniques fail to explain the cause of outliers to the experts. This is critical for new diseases and pandemics where current knowledge is insufficient. We propose to address these issues by extending our existing work called IDEAL, which is an LSTM-autoencoder based approach for data quality testing of sequential records, and provides explanations of constraint violations in a manner that is understandable to end-users. The extension (1) uses a novel two-level reshaping technique that splits COVID-19 data sets into multiple temporally-dependent subsequences and (2) adds a data visualization plot to further explain the anomalies and evaluate the level of abnormality of subsequences detected by IDEAL. We performed two systematic evaluation studies for our anomalous subsequence detection. One study uses aggregate data, including the number of cases, deaths, recovered, and percentage of hospitalization rate, collected from a COVID tracking project, New York Times, and Johns Hopkins for the same time period. The other study uses COVID-19 patient medical records obtained from Anschutz Medical Center health data warehouse. The results are promising and indicate that our techniques can be used to detect anomalies in large volumes of real-world unlabeled data whose accuracy or validity is unknown.","Homayouni, H.; Ray, I.; Ghosh, S.; Gondalia, S.; Kahn, M.

Despite advances in the clinical setting, the immune cellular network in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that mediates such therapy is not well understood. Interleukin 33 (IL33) is highly expressed in normal epithelial cells but downregulated in tumor cells in advanced carcinoma. Here, we showed that IL33 was induced in tumor cells after treatment with ICB such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). ST2 signaling in non-tumor cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, was critical for the antitumor efficacy of ICB immunotherapy.

General control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) are four kinases that regulate eIF2&#945; phosphorylation. MAIN BODY: In the viral infection process, dsRNA or viral proteins produced by viral proliferation activate different eIF2&#945; kinases, resulting in eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, which hinders ternary tRNAMet-GTP-eIF2 complex formation and inhibits host or viral protein synthesis. The stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex aggregates under viral infection stress to form stress granules (SGs), which encapsulate viral RNA and transcription- and translation-related proteins, thereby limiting virus proliferation. However, many viruses have evolved a corresponding escape mechanism to synthesize their own proteins in the event of host protein synthesis shutdown and SG formation caused by eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, and viruses can block the cell replication cycle through the PERK-eIF2&#945; pathway, providing a favorable environment for their own replication. Subsequently, viruses can induce host cell autophagy or apoptosis through the eIF2&#945;-ATF4-CHOP pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the role of eIF2&#945; in viral infection to provide a reference for studying the interactions between viruses and hosts.","Liu, Yuanzhi; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Jia, Renyong; Liu, Mafeng; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Zhang, Shaqiu; Zhao, Xin-Xin; Huang, Juan; Mao, Sai; Ou, Xumin; Gao, Qun; Wang, Yin; Xu, Zhiwen; Chen, Zhengli; Zhu, Ling; Luo, Qihui; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Xiaoyue",Virol J,432,2

It is a multidomain protein that integrates readout of different histone modification states and DNA methylation with enzymatic histone ubiquitylation activity. Emerging evidence indicates that the chromatin-binding and enzymatic modules of UHRF1 do not act in isolation but interplay in a coordinated and regulated manner. Here, we compared two splicing variants (V1, V2) of murine UHRF1 (mUHRF1) with human UHRF1 (hUHRF1). We show that insertion of nine amino acids in a linker region connecting the different TTD and PHD histone modification-binding domains causes distinct H3K9me3-binding behaviour of mUHRF1 V1. Structural analysis suggests that in mUHRF1 V1, in contrast to V2 and hUHRF1, the linker is anchored in a surface groove of the TTD domain, resulting in creation of a coupled TTD-PHD module. This establishes multivalent, synergistic H3-tail binding causing distinct cellular localization and enhanced H3K9me3-nucleosome ubiquitylation activity. In contrast to hUHRF1, H3K9me3-binding of the murine proteins is not allosterically regulated by phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate that interacts with a separate less-conserved polybasic linker region of the protein. Our results highlight the importance of flexible linkers in regulating multidomain chromatin binding proteins and point to divergent evolution of their regulation.","Tauber, Maria; Kreuz, Sarah; Lemak, Alexander; Mandal, Papita; Yerkesh, Zhadyra; Veluchamy, Alaguraj; Al-Gashgari, Bothayna; Aljahani, Abrar; Cortés-Medina, Lorena V; Azhibek, Dulat; Fan, Lixin; Ong, Michelle S; Duan, Shili; Houliston, Scott; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H; Fischle, Wolfgang",Nucleic acids res,432,31

However, they may encounter difficulties adapting their practices to the pandemic. We provide here an analysis of guidelines for the reorganisation of GP surgeries during the beginning of the pandemic from 15 countries. METHODS: A network of GPs collaborated together in a three-step process: (i) identification of key recommendations of GP surgery reorganisation, according to WHO, CDC and health professional resources from health care facilities; (ii) collection of key recommendations included in the guidelines published in 15 countries; (iii) analysis, comparison and synthesis of the results. RESULTS: Recommendations for the reorganisation of GP surgeries of four types were identified: (i) reorganisation of GP consultations (cancelation of non-urgent consultations, follow-up via e-consultations), (ii) reorganisation of GP surgeries (area partitioning, visual alerts and signs, strict hygiene measures), (iii) reorganisation of medical examinations by GPs (equipment, hygiene, partial clinical examinations, patient education), (iv) reorganisation of GP staff (equipment, management, meetings, collaboration with the local community). CONCLUSIONS: We provide here an analysis of guidelines for the reorganisation of GP surgeries during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak from 15 countries. These guidelines focus principally on clinical care, with less attention paid to staff management, and the area of epidemiological surveillance and research is largely neglected. The differences of guidelines between countries and the difficulty to apply them in routine care, highlight the need of advanced research in primary care. Thereby, primary care would be able to provide recommendations adapted to the real-world settings and with stronger evidence, which is especially necessary during pandemics.","Tsopra, Rosy; Frappe, Paul; Streit, Sven; Neves, Ana Luisa; Honkoop, Persijn J; Espinosa-Gonzalez, Ana Belen; Geroglu, Berk; Jahr, Tobias; Lingner, Heidrun; Nessler, Katarzyna; Pesolillo, Gabriella; Sivertsen, Øyvind Stople; Thulesius, Hans; Zoitanu, Raluca; Burgun, Anita; Kinouani, Shérazade",BMC Fam Pract,432,20

As of August 31, 2020, globally, there have been approximately 25,500,000 confirmed cases and 850,000 deaths; in the United States (50 states plus District of Columbia), there have been more than 6,000,000 confirmed cases and 183,000 deaths. We propose a Bayesian mixture model to predict and monitor COVID-19 mortality across the United States. The model captures skewed unimodal (prolonged recovery) or multimodal (multiple surges) curves. The results show that across all states, the first peak dates of mortality varied between April 4, 2020 for Alaska and June 18, 2020 for Arkansas. As of August 31, 2020, 31 states had a clear bimodal curve showing a strong second surge. The peak date for a second surge ranged from July 1, 2020 for Virginia to September 12, 2020 for Hawaii. The first peak for the United States occurred about April 16, 2020-dominated by New York and New Jersey-and a second peak on August 6, 2020-dominated by California, Texas, and Florida. Reliable models for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic are essential to informing resource allocation and intervention strategies. A Bayesian mixture model was able to more accurately predict the shape of the mortality curves across the United States than other models, including the timing of multiple peaks. However, given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, it is important that the results be updated regularly to identify and better monitor future waves, and characterize the epidemiology of the pandemic.","Kaciroti, Niko A; Lumeng, Carey; Parekh, Vikas; Boulton, Matthew L",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,432,19

Because of failure in timely closing of borders of the affected region, COVID-19 spread across like a wildfire through air travel initiating a pandemic. It is a serious lower respiratory track viral infection caused by highly contagious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus including COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 causes zoonotic diseases and thought to be originated from bats. Since its first incidence, the virus has spread all across the world, causing serious human casualties, economic losses, and disrupting global supply chains. As with SARS-CoV, COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar path of airborne infection, but is less lethal and more infectious than SARS and MERS. This review focusses on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, especially on the dysfunctional immune responses following a cytokine storm in severely affected persons. The mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors present on the epithelial lining of lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and mucus membranes. Older persons with weaker immune system and associated co-morbidities are more vulnerable to have dysfunctional immune responses, as most of them concomitantly have severe hypovitaminosis D. Consequently, causing severe damage to key organs of the body including lungs and the cardiovascular system. Since, vast majority of persons enters to the intensive care units and died, had severe vitamin D deficiency, thus, this area must be investigated seriously. In addition, this article assesses the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19. Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article provides the urgency of needed evidences through large population based randomized controlled trials and ecological studies to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D in COVID-19.","Kumar, Raman; Rathi, Himani; Haq, Afrozul; Wimalawansa, Sunil J; Sharma, Alpana",Virus Res,432,23

Impairment in immunity activation in some patients, mostly elderlies, leads to high mortalities; thus, promoting immune responses may help. BCG vaccine is under investigation to prevent COVID-19 due to its non-specific effects on the immune system. However, other complementary immune-induction methods at early stages of the disease may be needed. Here, the potentially preventive immunologic effects of BCG and influenza vaccination are compared with the immune response defects caused by aging and COVID-19. BCG co-administration with interferon-&#945;/-ß, or influenza vaccine is suggested to overcome its shortcomings in interferon signaling against COVID-19.

RESULTS: Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time. Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning.

METHODS: The immunochromatography (ICG) rapid test kit and the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) quantitative antibody test were performed. The differences in IgM and IgG antibody prevalence in different serological assays were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 637 participants were included in this research. Two staff were IgM positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test (cutoff value: 10 AU/ml) of 51 staff who were IgM positive in the rapid test kit. Six staff were IgG positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test of 56 staff who were IgG positive in the rapid test kit. The proportion of antibody positive staff differed greatly between the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test. CONCLUSIONS: There was a vast difference in the proportions of IgG and IgM antibody positive staff in the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test results. The results from the only rapid test kit might have to be interpreted with caution. Further studies to evaluate antibody testing accuracy are required to promote the understanding of each assay's characteristics and determine their purposes in each community.","Kobashi, Yurie; Shimazu, Yuzo; Nishikawa, Yoshitaka; Kawamura, Takeshi; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Obara, Daiji; Tsubokura, Masaharu",Int Immunopharmacol,432,20

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of ?65 years paients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty between March 11 and May 28, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors for in hospital death. RESULTS: 218 patients (112 men, 106 women) were included, of whom 166 were discharged and 52 died in hospital. With univariate analysis, various clinical features and laboratory variables were found to be significantly different (ie P <0.05). In multivariate logistic regression analysis; present malignancy (odds ratio [OR]= 4.817, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.107-20.958, p:0.036), dyspnea (OR=4.652, 95% CI=1.473-14.688, p:0.009), Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NRL) (OR=1.097, 95% CI=1.012-1.188, p: 0.025), the highest values of CRP (OR=1.006, 95% CI=1.000-1.012, p: 0.049), LDH (OR=1.002, 95% CI=1.001-1.004, p: 0.003) and creatinine levels (OR=1.497, 95% CI=1.126-1.990, p: 0.006), SpO2 values on admission (OR=0.897, 95% CI=0.811-0.993, p: 0.036) and azithromycin use (OR=0.239, 95% CI=0.065-0.874, p: 0.031) were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: The presence of malignancy, symptoms of dyspnea, high NLR, highest CRP, LDH and creatinine levels, low saturation on admission predicted mortality, while the azithromycin use was found to be protective against mortality.

However, peripheral neuropathy was only reported once before. A 40-year-old healthy woman presented with two weeks of cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, intermittent fevers, fatigue, and myalgia but no weakness. She tested positive for the SARS-Cov-2. Physical exam showed no neurologic deficit. Two weeks later, respiratory symptoms were improving but she developed sudden leg pain, numbness, and weakness. She described it as a ""pain crisis"". Neurological exam showed bilateral symmetrical, non-ascending lower extremity weakness and normal, symmetric reflexes. She had normal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine, spinal fluid analysis, serum studies including creatinine kinase and C-reactive protein. She had elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low serum copper (72.9 (ref: 80.0-155.0 ug/dL)) and low vitamin B6 (14.6 (ref: 20.0-125.0 nmol/L)). A diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2-associated peripheral neuropathy was considered. We pursued empiric treatment with intravenous steroids (1000 mg methylprednisolone for three days), followed by a total of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) given over five days. Pain management was done with gabapentin and ketorolac. We replaced copper and vitamin B6. Six weeks later, she reported improvement and was closer to baseline, but she endorsed residual, exertional, mild bilateral lower extremity pain, numbness, and weakness. Previous reports of treatment of SARS-Cov-2-associated neuropathy included corticosteroids and IVIG. Our patient saw the most symptomatic improvement with gabapentin. In our case, the preserved reflexes, lack of ascending pattern, sudden onset of symptoms, and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) argued against Guillain-Barre syndrome. Copper deficiency can result in myelopathy but not peripheral neuropathy, so is unlikely the sole explanation. Awareness and early treatment of peripheral neuropathy in SARS-Cov-2 can result in improved clinical outcomes for patients.","Bureau, Britta L; Obeidat, Ahmed; Dhariwal, Mohan S; Jha, Pinky",Cureus,432,26

Although mitochondria possess a powerful antioxidant system, an excess of ROS cannot be completely neutralized and cumulative oxidative damage may lead to decreasing mitochondrial efficiency in energy production, as well as an increasing ROS excess, which is known to cause a critical imbalance in antioxidant/oxidant mechanisms and a ""vicious circle"" in mitochondrial injury. Due to insufficient energy production, chronic exposure to ROS overproduction consequently leads to the oxidative damage of life-important biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and amino acids, among others. Different forms of mitochondrial dysfunction (mitochondriopathies) may affect the brain, heart, peripheral nervous and endocrine systems, eyes, ears, gut, and kidney, among other organs. Consequently, mitochondriopathies have been proposed as an attractive diagnostic target to be investigated in any patient with unexplained progressive multisystem disorder. This review article highlights the pathomechanisms of mitochondriopathies, details advanced analytical tools, and suggests predictive approaches, targeted prevention and personalization of medical services as instrumental for the overall management of mitochondriopathy-related cascading pathologies.","Liskova, Alena; Samec, Marek; Koklesova, Lenka; Kudela, Erik; Kubatka, Peter; Golubnitschaja, Olga",Int. j. mol. sci.

Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 11 patients underwent CIFA for skull base lesions dissection from December 2014 to January 2019 in the department of otolaryngology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital. There were 6 male and 5 female patients, with age range of 16-72 years old and median age of 53 years old. Five patients underwent CIFA Type B and D, and the other 6 underwent CIFA A and B. All patients were followed up regularly by CT and MRI to observe possible recurrence. Results: Among the 5 patients with CIFA Type B and D, 3 were giant cell tumor and 2 were giant cell reparative granuloma, and median maximum cross-section size was 42 mm×46 mm (range from 37 mm×18 mm to 56 mm×53 mm). Among the 6 patients with CIFA Type A and B, 4 were paraganglioma of head and neck, 1 was schwannoma of skull base, 1 was petrous cholesteatoma, and median maximum cross-section size was 43 mm×36 mm (range from 24 mm×22 mm to 63 mm×35 mm). Nine patients underwent complete resection of the tumor in the first stage. In 2 patients, the extracranial parts were removed in the first stage, and the intracranial part was removed in the second stage. Tympanum and ossicular reconstruction were done in one of the CIFA Type B and group D, and 1 year's postoperative hearing was mild conductive hearing loss. There was no cerebrospinal fluid leakage of all patients. All the 5 patients with normal facial nerve function before surgery recovered to H-B grade â to â ¡ within 3 months after surgery. Among the 4 patients whose preoperative facial nerve function were grade â ¡, 2 recovered to grade I after surgery and the other 2 were still grade â ¡. For the patient whose preoperative facial nerve function was grade â ¤, his postoperative recovery was grade â ¢. There was 1 patient whose pre-operative FN function was H-B grade â ¢, and the post-operative FN function was grade â ¥ due to FN resection. Except for 2 cases with cochlear involved before surgery, cochleae of the other 9 cases were preserved. The follow-up time was 14 to 58 months. No recurrence was observed in all patients. Conclusions: The CIFA can safely and completely remove the extensive lesions that invade the skull base, and the facial nerve function can be well protected and recovered intro-and post-operation. Appropriate use of combined IFA can not only achieve good exposure and complete resection of lesions, but also create conditions for functional reconstruction.","Wei, X M; Gao, Z Q; Xu, Z Q; Yang, H; Zhang, Z H; Tian, X; Zhao, Y; Zhou, Y L; Feng, G D",Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi,432,6

We hypothesize that financial literacy encourages people to exercise regularly. Using Osaka University’s Preference Parameters Study (PPS) for 2010, we categorized respondents into two groups: those who exercise regularly or at least once a week and those who do not. Our probit estimation results show that financial literacy is positively related with exercise behavior, meaning that financially literate people are more likely to exercise regularly. As the COVID-19 health pandemic seems to exacerbate peoples’ physical inactivity, the results of our study show an alternative approach to encourage exercise.

By performing comparative genome analysis of nidovirales that contain the family of coronaviruses, we traced the origin of proofreading, surprisingly to the eukaryotic antiviral component ZNFX1. This common recent ancestor contributes two zinc finger (ZnF) motifs that are unique to viral exonuclease, segregating them from DNA proof-readers. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that following acquisition, genomes of coronaviruses retained and further fine-tuned proofreading exonuclease, whereas related families harbor substitution of key residues in ZnF1 motif concomitant to a reduction in their genome sizes. Structural modelling followed by simulation suggests the role of ZnF in RNA binding. Key ZnF residues strongly coevolve with replicase, and the helicase involved in duplex RNA unwinding. Hence, fidelity of replication in coronaviruses is a result of convergent evolution, that enables maintenance of genome stability akin to cellular proofreading systems.","Natarajan, Vivek T; Aswin, Keerthic; Ramachandran, Srinivasan",,432,26

This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals' decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed, resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease. In all the scenario considered, the divergence between the individual and societal strategies happens both before the peak of the epidemic, due to individuals' fears, and after, when a significant propagation is still underway.","Elie, Romuald; Hubert, Emma; Turinici, Gabriel",Math.

Firstly, the rough dataset is used to reduce the dimension of the indices. Secondly, the number of neurons in the multilayer of BPNN is optimized by QSIA, QSFOA, QPSO, and QGA, respectively. Finally, the deep learning models are then used to establish prediction models with the best number of neurons under these three algorithms for the non-linear real stock returns. The results indicate that the QSFOA-BPNN model has the highest prediction accuracy among all models, and it is defined as the most effective feasible method.

Membrane compartments comprise the system limiting cells (one or two membranes in bacteria, a unique plasma membrane in eukaryotes) and a variety of internal vesicular, subspherical, tubular, or reticulated organelles. In eukaryotes, the internal membranes comprise on the one hand the general endomembrane system, a dynamic network including organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the nuclear envelope, etc. and also the plasma membrane, which are linked via direct lateral connectivity (e.g. between the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear outer envelope membrane) or indirectly via vesicular trafficking. On the other hand, semi-autonomous organelles, i.e. mitochondria and chloroplasts, are disconnected from the endomembrane system and request vertical transmission following cell division. Membranes are organized as lipid bilayers in which proteins are embedded. The budding of some of these membranes, leading to the formation of the so-called lipid droplets (LDs) loaded with hydrophobic molecules, most notably triacylglycerol, is conserved in all clades. The evolution of eukaryotes is marked by the acquisition of mitochondria and simple plastids from Gram-positive bacteria by primary endosymbiosis events and the emergence of extremely complex plastids, collectively called secondary plastids, bounded by three to four membranes, following multiple and independent secondary endosymbiosis events. There is currently no consensus view of the evolution of LDs in the Tree of Life. Some features are conserved; others show a striking level of diversification. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the architecture, dynamics, and multitude of functions of the lipid droplets in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes deriving from primary and secondary endosymbiosis events.","Lupette, Josselin; Maréchal, Eric",Results Probl Cell Differ,432,33

It also compared the diagnostic performances of upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: From 25 January to 29 March 2020, all URT and LRT samples collected from patients with suspected COVID-19 received in the virology laboratory of Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital (Paris, France) were simultaneously tested for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: A total of 1423 consecutive patients were tested: 677 (47.6%) males, 746 (52.4%) females, median age 50 (range, 1-103) years. Twenty-one (1.5%) patients were positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in LRT than in URT (53.6% vs. 13.4%; p<0.0001). The analysis of paired samples from 117 (8.2%) patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 load was lower in URT than in LRT samples in 65% of cases. CONCLUSION: The detection of other respiratory viruses in patients during this epidemic period could not rule out SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of children and adolescents (<21 years of age) with a SARS-CoV-2-infected close contact. We collected nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs at enrollment and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of 382 children, 293 (77%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while asthma is associated with decreased risk. Age-related differences in the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be considered when evaluating children for COVID-19 and in developing screening strategies for schools and childcare settings.","Hurst, Jillian H; Heston, Sarah M; Chambers, Hailey N; Cunningham, Hannah M; Price, Meghan J; Suarez, Lilianna; Crew, Carter G; Bose, Shree; Aquino, Jhoanna N; Carr, Stuart T; Griffin, S Michelle; Smith, Stephanie H; Jenkins, Kirsten; Pfeiffer, Trevor S; Rodriguez, Javier; DeMarco, C Todd; De Naeyer, Nicole A; Gurley, Thaddeus C; Louzao, Raul; Zhao, Congwen; Cunningham, Coleen K; Steinbach, William J; Denny, Thomas N; Lugo, Debra J; Moody, M Anthony; Permar, Sallie R; Rotta, Alexandre T; Turner, Nicholas A; Walter, Emmanuel B; Woods, Christopher W; Kelly, Matthew S",Clin. infect. dis,432,29

Here, we evaluated a dead-end hollow fiber ultrafilter (D-HFUF) for primary concentration, followed by the CP Select&#8482; for secondary concentration from 2 L volumes of primary treated wastewater. Various amendments to each concentration procedure were investigated to optimally recover seeded OC43 (betacoronavirus) from wastewater. During primary concentration, the D-HFUF recovered 69 ± 18% (n = 29) of spiked OC43 from 2 L of wastewater. For secondary concentration, the CP Select&#8482; system using the Wastewater Application settings was capable of processing 100 mL volumes of primary filter eluates in <25 min. A hand-driven syringe elution proved to be significantly superior (p = 0.0299) to the CP Select&#8482; elution for recovering OC43 from filter eluates, 48 ± 2% compared to 31 ± 3%, respectively. For the complete method (primary and secondary concentration combined), the D-HFUF and CP select/syringe elution achieved overall 22 ± 4% recovery of spiked OC43 through (n = 8) replicate filters. Given the lack of available standardized methodology confounded by the inherent limitations of relying on viral RNA for wastewater surveillance of SARS CoV 2, it is important to acknowledge these challenges when interpreting this data to estimate community infection rates. However, the development of methods that can substantially increase sample volumes will likely allow for reporting of quantifiable viral data for wastewater surveillance, equipping public health officials with information necessary to better estimate community infection rates.","McMinn, Brian R; Korajkic, Asja; Kelleher, Julie; Herrmann, Michael P; Pemberton, Adin C; Ahmed, Warish; Villegas, Eric N; Oshima, Kevin",Sci Total Environ,432,26

Information regarding genetic differences was also important for the correct choice of parental material for the selection of high quality cultivars. Two elite and six obsolete cultivars of durum-wheat were characterized with 25-simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. All accessions were evaluated for 2-agronomic-traits (Yield (Y) and Thousand-Kernel-Weight (TKW)) and 11 grain quality-traits (grain protein content (GPC), grain moisture contents (H), carotene content (CT), sedimentation test (SDS), gluten content (GC), gluten index (GI), semolina color index (L*, a*, b*) and alveographic parameters (W and P/L)) under randomized complete block design with three replication for two crop seasons (2015-2017). Genetic characterization through SSR markers revealed 126 alleles with an average of 5.04 alleles locus-1 and had average 0.79 polymorphism information content (PIC). The comparisons revealed that elite accessions were more productive in terms of grain yield and TKW, whereas obsolete accessions showed high GPC and end-use quality-traits. The generated dendrogram based on SSR markers, agronomic, seed quality-traits clearly differentiate the genotypes in two main groups obsolete and elite accessions. Analysis of correlation revealed a significant association between the traits TKW, Y, b*, a*, GPC, GC, SDS and H. High genetic diversity found between elite and obsolete cultivars for parameters such as yield, end-use quality and their correlation with SSR markers could help breeders for an eventual breeding program on durum-wheat.","Jlassi, Ines; Bnejdi, Fethi; Saadoun, Mourad; Hajji, Abdelhamid; Mansouri, Dhouha; Ben-Attia, Mossadok; El-Gazzah, Mohamed; El-Bok, Safia",Mol.

METHODS: Using Poisson regression and regularized linear regression (elastic net), we evaluated the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 mortality rates in Chicago through July 22 (2514 deaths across 795 populated census tracts). RESULTS: Black residents (31% of the population) accounted for 42% of COVID-19 deaths. Deaths among Hispanic/Latino residents occurred at a younger age (63 years, compared to 71 for white residents). Regarding residential setting, 52% of deaths among white residents occurred inside nursing homes, compared to 35% of deaths among Black residents and 17% among Hispanic/Latino residents. Higher COVID-19 mortality was seen in neighborhoods with heightened barriers to social distancing and low health insurance coverage. Neighborhoods with a higher percentage of white and Asian residents had lower COVID-19 mortality. The associations differed by race, suggesting that neighborhood context may be most tightly linked to COVID-19 mortality among white residents. CONCLUSIONS: We describe communities that may benefit from supportive services, and identify traits of communities that may benefit from targeted campaigns for prevention and testing to prevent future deaths from COVID-19.","Bryan, Molly Scannell; Sun, Jiehuan; Jagai, Jyotsna; Horton, Daniel E; Montgomery, Anastasia; Sargis, Robert; Argos, Maria",Ann. epidemiol,432,1

This study aimed to evaluate different aspects of TB learning amongst undergraduate dental students during the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental students in selected Iraqi universities (University of Baghdad, University of Sulaimani and Dijlah University College) were invited to join the study. A questionnaire was created using a Google platform and answered by students. Satisfaction and attitude towards TB learning plus total evaluation scores for lecturers were examined. RESULTS: A total of 832 out of 1800 dental students participated in the study. The majority of participants have basic (40.7%) and intermediate (47.5%) computer skills, and more than half of them lack any experience in TB learning. The overall satisfaction and positive attitude towards TB learning were less than 50%. Students at final grade, with advanced computer skills and TB learning experience, showed higher satisfaction (OR: 3.031, 2.876, 3.644, respectively) and a more positive attitude (OR: 3.172, 3.035, 3.477, respectively) towards TB learning than those at earlier grades. Total evaluation scores for lecturers were higher amongst females (11.5 ± 5.8) than males (9.9 ± 7.2) as well as amongst participants at final grade (14.0 ± 6.2), with advanced computer skills (13.8 ± 6.1) and TB learning experience (16.2 ± 6.0). CONCLUSIONS: Dental students demonstrated low-moderate satisfaction and positive attitude towards TB learning and the quality of material presented to them. Integrating TB learning into the dental education curriculum is an essential step in enhancing the acceptance of TB learning in the future.","Al-Taweel, Firas B; Abdulkareem, Ali A; Gul, Sarhang S; Alshami, Muhanad L",Eur. j. dent. educ,432,1

Optic neuritis has been repeatedly reported in COVID-19 patients and may occur with or without affection of other cranial nerves. Since cerebro-spinal fluid parameters can be abnormal in COVID-19 associated optic neuritis, these patients require a spinal tap. Before diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 associated optic neuritis various differentials need to be excluded. Since SARS-CoV-2 causes endothelial damage complicated by thrombus formation and thromboembolism, ophthalmologic vascular complication due to an infection with SARS-CoV-2 such as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), and retinal vein occlusion need to be excluded. CRAO may result from arterial hypertension, myocarditis, heart failure, Takotsubo syndrome, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter, frequent cardiac complications of COVID-19.

Patients with diabetes and uncontrolled blood glucose levels are at increased risk for poor clinical outcomes and in-hospital mortality related to COVID-19. Therefore, achieving good glycaemic control is of paramount importance among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Basal-bolus insulin therapy is a safe and effective intervention for the management of hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients. The aim of this article is to provide a practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This guidance document was formulated based on the review of available literature and the combined personal experiences of the authors. We provide a comprehensive review on the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen, including its principles, rationale, indications, prerequisites, initiation, and dose titration, and also suggest targets for blood glucose control and different levels of capillary blood glucose monitoring. Various case scenarios are used to illustrate how optimal glucose control can be achieved, such as through adjustments in doses of prandial and basal insulin, the use of correctional insulin dosing and changes in the timing and content of major and minor meals. CONCLUSION: The practical guidance for the use of the basal-bolus insulin regimen in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus presented here can be used for patients admitted to hospital for indications other than COVID-19 and for those in ambulatory care.","Attri, Bhawna; Goyal, Alpesh; Gupta, Yashdeep; Tandon, Nikhil",Diabetes Ther,432,1

Specifically, DLX5 maintains a bivalent state in normal tissues; its promoter is hypermethylation, leading to DLX5 transcriptional silencing in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). In stark contrast, DLX5 promoter gains active histone marks and becomes transcriptionally activated in ESCC, which is directly mediated by SOX2.

Les facteurs associés à une plus forte séroprévalence étaient : l’âge&lt;30 ans (aOR=1,59, (95 % IC, 1,06–2,37)), le statut d’étudiant (aOR=3,38, (95 % IC, 1,62–7,05)) avec une séroprévalence de 16,9 % dans cette catégorie. L’unité de travail, y compris le fait d’avoir travaillé en unité Covid ou en réanimation, ainsi que l’exposition à des patients (quel que soit leur statut infectieux) n’étaient pas associé à une augmentation de la séroprévalence. Par contre les professionnels rapportant un contact avec un patient Covid, sans protection adaptée, ou ayant pratiqué des taches aérosolisantes, y compris avec un masque FFP2, avaient un surrisque d’infection Covid-19 (respectivement aOR à 1,66 et 1,7). Enfin, l’exposition à un collègue infecté ou à un cas familial était également associée à une augmentation de la prévalence sérologique. Conclusion Les mesures mises en place pour limiter la transmission du SARS-Cov-2 des patients aux professionnels de santé semblent efficaces. En complément de la vaccination, l’éviction systématique des professionnels infectés, la formation des étudiants et le rappel des mesures d’hygiène durant les temps de pause pourraient limiter la contamination des professionnels de santé.","Vitrat, V.; Maillard, A.; Raybaud, A.; Wackenheim, C.; Chanzy, B.; Nguyen, S.; Valran, A.; Bosch, A.; Noret, M.; Delory, T.",Infectious Diseases Now,432,19

Surprisingly, a broad range of symptoms has been reported since COVID-19 emergence. Individual variations in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 can be due to non-genetic and genetic factors. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited condition that is associated with an increased risk of liver and lung diseases which may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. At the same time, there could be a possibility of developing non-hereditary AATD. DISCUSSION: In addition to some evidence showing the role of vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 pathology, it has been recognized that there is a biological link between AAT and vitamin D. Therefore, here we offer a new perspective that lower vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients can cause acquired AATD that provide a condition with more disease severity and a higher risk of death. As a consequence, COVID-19 individuals with vitamin D deficiency may have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Therefore, early vitamin D and AAT assessments and optimal interventions could be helpful to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shimi, Ghazaleh; Zand, Hamid",Inflamm Res,432,24

A total of 200 consecutive patients were interviewed using a semistructured demographic and clinical checklist, the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the short form 36 (SF-36) health survey. Results: Poor physical and mental QoL was reported in 64% and 62% of patients with DM, respectively. Female gender, increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), associated physical comorbidities, and depressive symptoms were associated with lesser odds of physical QoL (OR 0.46, 0.96, 0.29, and 0.88, respectively). Besides, female gender, associated physical comorbidities, fear of COVID-19 virus infection (FCV), and depressive symptoms were associated with lesser odds of mental QoL (OR 0.41, 0.36, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively). The FCV was inversely correlated with all items of SF-36 among patients. Conclusion: QoL, either physical or mental, was adversely affected among patients with DM during pandemic. FCV was negatively correlated with all QOL domains.

Methods: This is an observational study of 921 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 respiratory infection to Hospital General Universitario Ciudad Real from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Following data were collected including patient demographic information, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapeutic interventions during the hospitalization and clinical outcomes. Results: The mean age was 78 years, and 59.2% of patients had a history of hypertension. Patients with previous treatment with RAS inhibitor (42.4%) showed lower risk of the primary composite endpoint (mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation). Treatment with RAS inhibitor (both outpatient treatment and during hospitalization) had neither effect on mortality nor need for invasive ventilation. There were no differences in time-to-event analysis between groups. Conclusions: RAS inhibitor treatment prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 respiratory infection was associated with lower risk of the primary composite endpoint and did not show neither impact on mortality nor need for invasive mechanical ventilation, even if these drugs were prescribed during hospitalization.","Martínez-Del Río, Jorge; Piqueras-Flores, Jesús; Nieto-Sandoval Martín de la Sierra, Patricia; Negreira-Caamaño, Martín; Águila-Gordo, Daniel; Mateo-Gómez, Cristina; Salas-Bravo, Daniel; Rodríguez-Martínez, Marta",,432,16

A better explanation for the variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mitotane, and the optimization and individualization of mitotane treatment, is desirable for patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop a population PK (PopPK) model to characterize and predict the PK profiles of mitotane in patients with ACC, as well as to explore the effect of genetic variation on mitotane clearance. Ultimately, we aimed to facilitate mitotane dose optimization and individualization for patients with ACC. METHODS: Mitotane concentration and dosing data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of patients with ACC taking mitotane orally and participating in the Dutch Adrenal Network. PopPK modelling analysis was performed using NONMEM (version 7.4.1). Genotypes of drug enzymes and transporters, patient demographic information, and clinical characteristics were investigated as covariates. Subsequently, simulations were performed for optimizing treatment regimens. RESULTS: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best described the PK data of mitotane collected from 48 patients. Lean body weight (LBW) and genotypes of CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285), SLCO1B3 699A>G (rs7311358) and SLCO1B1 571T>C (rs4149057) were found to significantly affect mitotane clearance (CL/F), which decreased the coefficient of variation (CV%) of the random inter-individual variability of CL/F from 67.0 to 43.0%. Fat amount (i.e. body weight - LBW) was found to significantly affect the central distribution volume. Simulation results indicated that determining the starting dose using the developed model is beneficial in terms of shortening the period to reach the therapeutic target and limit the risk of toxicity. A regimen that can effectively maintain mitotane concentration within 14-20 mg/L was established. CONCLUSIONS: A two-compartment PopPK model well-characterized mitotane PK profiles in patients with ACC. The CYP2C19 enzyme and SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 transporters may play roles in mitotane disposition. The developed model is beneficial in terms of optimizing mitotane treatment schedules and individualizing the initial dose for patients with ACC. Further validation of these findings is still required.","Yin, Anyue; Ettaieb, Madeleine H T; Swen, Jesse J; van Deun, Liselotte; Kerkhofs, Thomas M A; van der Straaten, Robert J H M; Corssmit, Eleonora P M; Gelderblom, Hans; Kerstens, Michiel N; Feelders, Richard A; Eekhoff, Marelise; Timmers, Henri J L M; D039,; Avolio, Antonio; Cusato, Jessica; Guchelaar, Henk-Jan; Haak, Harm R; Moes, Dirk Jan A R",Clin. pharmacokinetics,432,1

Among those stricken the hardest is the educational system. During the pandemic, schools are left with no choice but to adapt a new way of learning, from traditional learning to electronic learning. This sudden shift caused unruliness towards the new curriculum created and a lot were affected by these hasty revisions. E-learning suddenly became the only viable option to continue the academic year. Given the circumstance, the researchers have elected to pursue this paper to showcase the possibility of E-learning as an efficient alternative for sustainable education. It is also the objective of the researchers to illustrate the effectivity, modality and impact of E-Learning towards the students of De La Salle University Manila during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data gathered through the use of an online survey manifested that online learning was not deemed to be effective during the pandemic. The abrupt shift also brought a massive impact towards the student body, creating online rallies that pushed school administrations to take action regarding the matter. That being said, as the Philippines continue to explore the possibility of adapting an online learning curriculum, it is important to actively address the stability, quality, sustainability, and capability the country has in order to ensure that this kind of approach is found to be successful. Lastly, the government sector must be enjoined to provide more support for both private and public academic institutions.

DESIGN: Retrospective manual medical record review. SETTING: NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition. RESULTS: Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis.

Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days. As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.","Argenziano, Michael G; Bruce, Samuel L; Slater, Cody L; Tiao, Jonathan R; Baldwin, Matthew R; Barr, R Graham; Chang, Bernard P; Chau, Katherine H; Choi, Justin J; Gavin, Nicholas; Goyal, Parag; Mills, Angela M; Patel, Ashmi A; Romney, Marie-Laure S; Safford, Monika M; Schluger, Neil W; Sengupta, Soumitra; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Zucker, Jason E; Asadourian, Paul A; Bell, Fletcher M; Boyd, Rebekah; Cohen, Matthew F; Colquhoun, MacAlistair I; Colville, Lucy A; de Jonge, Joseph H; Dershowitz, Lyle B; Dey, Shirin A; Eiseman, Katherine A; Girvin, Zachary P; Goni, Daniella T; Harb, Amro A; Herzik, Nicholas; Householder, Sarah; Karaaslan, Lara E; Lee, Heather; Lieberman, Evan; Ling, Andrew; Lu, Ree; Shou, Arthur Y; Sisti, Alexander C; Snow, Zachary E; Sperring, Colin P; Xiong, Yuqing; Zhou, Henry W; Natarajan, Karthik; Hripcsak, George; Chen, Ruijun",BMJ,432,26

Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. While these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. ""Target trial emulation"" emphasizes the need to carefully design a non-experimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement -- and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design, which we refer to as ""policy trial emulation."" This is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each ""treatment cohort"" (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods -- with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics -- can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.","Ben-Michael, Eli; Feller, Avi; Stuart, Elizabeth A",,432,16

The mRNA vaccines are not new: vaccines that are based on attenuated mRNA viruses, such as Mumps, Measles, and Rubella, immunize by delivering their mRNAs into the cells of the vaccinated individual, who produces the viral proteins that then prime the immune response. Synthetic mRNA in liposomes can be seen as a modern, more refined, and thereby a safer version of those live attenuated RNA viruses. The anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (coding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) is the third synthetic RNA therapeutic being approved. It follows the aptamer Macugen® (which neutralizes VEGF) and the siRNA Onpattro® (which destroys the transthyretin-coding mRNA). Remarkably, the 30 µg of mRNA that are contained in the first approved anti-COVID-19 vaccine are sufficient for generating high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the virus in all injected volunteers (including participants over 65 years old). The efficacy and safety data are stunning. The distribution of these vaccines throughout the world will bring a halt to the coronavirus pandemic.","Pascolo, Steve",Viruses,432,16

There is a need to understand the impact on different health care professionals in different countries. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychological impact of the pandemic among dental staff in Norway in relation to background characteristics, work situation and preparedness of the service. METHODS: A structured questionnaire sent electronically to dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants inquired information about the lockdown period in Norway (13 March-17 April 2020). Distributions of background characteristics, perceptions of preparedness and psychological impact were calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was performed, and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) were used to compare psychological impact between dental professionals treating patients versus not during lockdown. RESULTS: Among the 1237 respondents, 58.8% worked clinically with patients. The majority were concerned of becoming infected (71.9%), of infecting others (85.4%) and/or of their family becoming infected (76.9%). Respondents who treated patients felt significantly more insecure about whether having become infected or not. The minority felt discriminated (6.7%), worried about death (11.7%), felt that life was threatening (9.8%) or felt loss of control of their lives (8.9%). More than 80% agreed that their workplace handled the situation well. Four factors were retrieved from the factor analysis. SEMs showed that gender and work experience had a significant effect on the factors Instability, Infection and Concerns. Respondents with work experience &#8805;10 years were less likely to express fear about Instability and Infection. Personnel reporting that their workplace had adequate equipment were also less concerned, however having adequate equipment did not reduce the factor Loss of control. CONCLUSION: The present study showed a considerable psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental personnel in Norway regardless of working clinically with patients or not. However, working with patients increased the insecurity about own infection status and of infecting people close to them. A safe working environment and adequate infection control measures are associated with less fear of infection and feeling of instability.","Uhlen, M M; Ansteinsson, V E; Stangvaltaite-Mouhat, L; Korzeniewska, L; Skudutyte-Rysstad, R; Shabestari, M; Mdala, I; Hovden, E A S",BMC Health Serv Res,432,24

As viruses lack their own glycosylation machinery, they are dependent on the host's machinery for these processes. Certain iminosugars are known to interfere with the N-linked glycosylation pathway by targeting and inhibiting &#945;-glucosidases I and II in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Perturbing ER &#945;-glucosidase function can prevent these enzymes from removing terminal glucose residues on N-linked glycans, interrupting the interaction between viral glycoproteins and host chaperone proteins that is necessary for proper folding of the viral protein. Iminosugars have demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo against multiple viruses. This review discuses the broad activity of iminosugars against Flaviviridae. Iminosugars have shown favorable activity against multiple members of the Flaviviridae family in vitro and in murine models of disease, although the activity and mechanism of inhibition can be virus specific. While iminosugars are not currently approved for the treatment of viral infections, their potential use as future host-targeted antiviral (HTAV) therapies continues to be investigated.","DeWald, Lisa Evans; Starr, Chloe; Butters, Terry; Treston, Anthony; Warfield, Kelly L",Antiviral Res,432,16

Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies.This position paper is structured into the following five topics:1. Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-22. Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease3. Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation4. Non-invasive ventilation in ARI5. Supply continuum for the treatment of ARIKey points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations. Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase.There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria. In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated - model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase. This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hüfner number and the cardiac output). In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles. Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection.The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation. If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff. A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected. In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times. If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO2.","Pfeifer, M; Ewig, S; Voshaar, T; Randerath, W; Bauer, T; Geiseler, J; Dellweg, D; Westhoff, M; Windisch, W; Schönhofer, B; Kluge, S; Lepper, P M",Pneumologie,432,16

Since the ongoing climate warming is known to alter nutritional environments encountered by ectotherms, a precise understanding of the integrated effects of these two factors on ectotherm performance is essential for improving the accuracy of predictions regarding how ectotherms will respond to climate warming. Here we employed response surface methodology to examine how multiple life-history traits were expressed across a grid of environmental conditions representing full combinations of six ambient temperatures (13, 18, 23, 28, 31, 33 °C) and eight dietary protein:carbohydrate ratios (P:C = 1:16, 1:8, 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 8:1) in Drosophila melanogaster. Different life-history traits were maximized in different regions in the two-dimensional temperature-nutrient space. The optimal temperature and P:C ratio identified for adult lifespan (13 °C and 1:16) were lower than those for early-life female fecundity (28 °C and 4:1). Similar divergence in thermal and nutritional optima was found between body mass at adult emergence (18 °C and P:C 1:1) and the rate of pre-adult development (28 °C and P:C 4:1). Pre-adult survival was maximized over a broad range of temperature (18-28 °C) and P:C ratio (1:8-8:1). These results indicate that the occurrence of life-history trade-offs is regulated by both temperature and dietary P:C ratio. The estimated measure of fitness was maximized at 23 °C and P:C 2:1. Based on the shape of the response surface constructed for this estimated fitness, we characterized the fundamental thermal and nutritional niche for D. melanogaster with unprecedented detail.","Kim, Keonhee E; Jang, Taehwan; Lee, Kwang Pum",Oecologia,432,16

In 96 individuals with LBP this cross-sectional study explored (a) the magnitude of exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) and (b) measures of pain sensitivity and clinical pain manifestations in individuals reporting a clinical relevant increase in back pain during physical activity compared with individuals reporting low or no increase in back pain during physical activity. METHODS: Cuff algometry was performed at baseline on the leg to assess pressure pain threshold (cPPT), tolerance (cPTT) and temporal summation of pain (cTSP). Manual PPTs were assessed on the back and leg before and after a 6-min walk test (6MWT). Back pain was scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) after each minute of walking. The EIH-effect was estimated as the increase in PPTs after the walk exercise. RESULTS: Twenty-seven individuals reported an increase of &#8805;2/10 in pain NRS scores during walking and compared with the individuals with <2/10 NRS scores: cPPT and EIH-effects were lower whereas cTSP, pain intensity and disability were increased (p < 0.03). Baseline NRS scores, EIH and pain thresholds were associated with the likelihood of an increase of &#8805;2/10 in back pain intensity during walking (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pain flares in response to physical activity in individuals with LBP seem to be linked with baseline pain sensitivity and pain intensity, and impair the beneficial EIH. Such information may better inform when individuals with LBP will have a beneficial effect of physical activity.

ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched in September 2021 to identify registered yet unpublished or ongoing studies. Study selectionProspective observational studies which compared the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination between those with immunocompromising medical conditions and those who were immunocompetent were included. Two reviewers independently screened for potentially eligible studies. Data extractionThe primary outcomes of interest were cumulative incidence of seroconversion after first and second doses of COVID vaccination. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 antibody titre level after first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccination. After duplicate data abstraction, a frequentist random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. ResultsAfter screening 3283 studies, 42 studies that met our inclusion criteria were identified. 18 immunocompromised cohorts from 17 studies reported seroconversion in immunocompromised patients compared to healthy controls after the first dose and 30 immunocompromised cohorts in 28 studies reporting data after the second dose. Among immunocompromised groups, in incremental order, transplant recipients had the lowest pooled risk ratio of 0.06 (95%CI: 0.04 to 0.09, I^2=0%, p=0.81) (GRADE=Moderate) followed by haematological cancer patients at 0.36 (95%CI: 0.21 to 0.62, I^2 = 89%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Moderate), solid cancer patients at 0.40 (95%CI: 0.31 to 0.52, I^2 = 63%, p=0.03) (GRADE=Moderate) and IMID patients at 0.66 (95%CI: 0.48 to 0.91, I^2=81%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Moderate). After the second dose, the lowest pooled risk ratio was again seen in transplant recipients at 0.29 (95%CI: 0.21 to 0.40, I^2=91%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Moderate), haematological cancer patients at 0.68 (95%CI: 0.57 to 0.80, I^2=68%, p=0.02) (GRADE=Low), IMID patients at 0.79 (95%CI: 0.72 to 0.86, I^2=87%, p<0.01) (GRADE=Low) and solid cancer at 0.92 (95%CI: 0.89 to 0.95, I^2=26%, p=0.25) (GRADE=Low). ConclusionSeroconversion rates and serological titres are significantly lower in immunocompromised patients with transplant recipients having the poorest outcomes. Additional strategies on top of the conventional 2-dose regimen will likely be warranted, such as a booster dose of the vaccine.

The aim of this study is to evaluate work and psychological impact of COVID-19 on Lombardy radiation therapy (RT) residents in the first 3 months of the outbreak (first lockdown). METHODS: An online questionnaire (22 multiple choice questions) via Microsoft Forms was administered on 30 May 2020 to RT residents. RESULTS: Nineteen Lombardy RT residents responded to the survey. Nineteen percent of residents underwent a nasal swab and 11% were quarantined. Seventeen residents (89%) reported an increase in workload. Twelve residents (63%) did not find any difference in terms of work distress; worsening was highlighted in 5 cases (26%). The majority has never considered the possibility of stopping work due to excessive stress (89%). Almost all the residents experienced self- or relative-referred apprehension (95%). Ninety-five percent reported having missed extra-work social relationships. Most of the sample noted worsening sleep quality and difficulty concentrating (69%). No residents requested psychological support, even if provided by the hospital. CONCLUSION: Overall, the residents adapted to the new workplace scenario, although some health risks and well-being challenges have been reported.

It takes years to vaccinate the whole population to protect them from this deadly virus, hence the management of SARS-CoV-2 largely depends on the widespread availability of an accurate diagnostic test. Towards addressing the unmet need of a reliable diagnostic test in the current work by utilizing the power of Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, a 44-mer G-quadruplex forming DNA aptamer against spike trimer antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was identified. The lead aptamer candidate (S14) was characterized thoroughly for its binding, selectivity, affinity, structure and batch-to-batch variability by utilizing various-biochemical, biophysical, and in silico techniques. S14 has demonstrated a low nanomolar Kd, confirming its tight binding to a spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2. S14 can detect as low as 2 nM of antigen. The clinical evaluation of S14 aptamer on nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n = 232) has displayed a highly discriminatory response between SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from the non-infected one with a sensitivity and specificity of â¼91 % and 98 %, respectively. Importantly, S14 aptamer-based test has evinced comparable performance with that of RT-PCR-based assay.

Puerarin, the major active ingredient in Pueraria lobata, exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. However, whether puerarin has an effect on 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis remains unknown. We established a mice model of intestinal mucositis through the intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU, and then injected puerarin (50 and 100 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days. Routine parameters, such as body weight, food intake, and diarrheal incidence, were examined to evaluate the effects of puerarin on intestinal mucositis in mice. The intestinal barrier's functions were also evaluated by measuring the serum recovery of fluorescein isothiocyanate-4kD dextran in this study. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory mediators, oxidative reactions, as well as apoptotic marker proteins, were determined to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of puerarin on intestinal mucositis. The model mice presented symptoms and histopathological changes typical of 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. In addition to vigorous inflammatory reactions, oxidative reactions and cell apoptosis, Janus kinase (JAK) was markedly activated. Puerarin decreased the expression levels of those of inflammatory mediators, oxidative reactions, and apoptosis-related proteins in 5-FU-induced mucositis by blocking the activation of JAK. Puerarin decreased inflammation, oxidative reactions and apoptosis, and protected intestinal barrier functions, to ameliorate 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis by inhibiting the activation of JAK. This study provides novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of, and treatment alternatives for, 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. Significance Statement This study reveals the mechanism responsible for the protective effects of puerarin in 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis. Puerarin inhibits the activation of JAK, thereby suppressing inflammation, oxidative reactions, cell apoptosis, and protected intestinal barrier functions, to ameliorate 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. Overall, our results suggest that puerarin can serve as a potential natural JAK inhibitor in the treatment of 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis.","Wang, Liang; Song, Baohui; Hu, Yan; Chen, Jun; Zhang, Shuaishuai; Chen, Dapeng; Wang, Jingyu",J. pharmacol. exp. ther,432,16

However, researchers exploring the association between COVID-19 related fear and mental health are yet to understand the conditions through which potential benefits may occur. Many factors could buffer the effects of COVID-19 related fear on mental health; support system is probably the predominant one. Thus, the present study examined the moderating effects of support system in the association between COVID-19 related fear and mental health outcomes - somatic symptoms, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and depression. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 163 volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related fear, support system, and mental health outcomes. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis and simple effect tests revealed that high levels of support from family, friends, and significant others might buffer/lessen the psychological sequelae (e.g., somatic symptoms, anxiety, and depression during public health emergencies, such as COVID-19 pandemic.

Because of its high transmissibility, COVID-19 has already caused extensive morbidity and mortality in many countries throughout the world. An accurate estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 would be beneficial for prevention programs. In light of discrepancies in original research on this issue, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled R0 for COVID-19 in the current outbreak. METHODS: International databases (including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus) were searched to identify studies conducted regarding the R0 of COVID-19. Articles were searched using the following keywords: ""COVID-19"" and ""basic reproduction number"" or ""R0."" The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 index, the Cochran Q test, and T2. A random-effects model was used to estimate R0 in this study. RESULTS: The mean reported R0 in the identified articles was 3.38±1.40, with a range of 1.90 to 6.49. According to the results of the random-effects model, the pooled R0 for COVID-19 was estimated as 3.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.81 to 3.82). According to the results of the meta-regression analysis, the type of model used to estimate R0 did not have a significant effect on heterogeneity among studies (p=0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the estimated R0 for COVID-19, reducing the number of contacts within the population is a necessary step to control the epidemic. The estimated overall R0 was higher than the World Health Organization estimate.","Alimohamadi, Yousef; Taghdir, Maryam; Sepandi, Mojtaba",J Prev Med Public Health,432,17

This highly infectious condition continues to ravage the world population and has yet to reach it peak infective rate in some countries. Many conventional drugs including hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir, etc., have been repurposed as treatments for this often deadly disease, but there is no specifically-designed effective drug available; also, the drugs mentioned have significant side effects and their efficacy is unknown. New drugs and vaccines are being designed as COVID-19 treatment, but their development and testing will require months to years. Time is not a luxury that this crisis has. Thus, there is a serious unmet need for the identification of currently-available and safe molecules which can be used to slow or treat COVID-19 disease. Here, we suggest melatonin be given consideration for prophylactic use or treatment alone or in combination with other drugs. Melatonin's multiple actions as an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-viral (against other viruses) make it a reasonable choice for use. Melatonin is readily available, can be easily synthesized in large quantities, is inexpensive, has a very high safety profile and can be easily self-administered. Melatonin is endogenously-produced molecule in small amounts with its production diminishing with increased age. Under the current critical conditions, large doses of melatonin alone or in combination with currently-recommended drugs, e.g., hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, to resist COVID-19 infection would seem judicious.","Reiter, Russel J.; Abreu-Gonzalez, Pedro; Marik, Paul E.; Dominguez-Rodriguez, Alberto",Front.

S. glanis is also a highly valued species for its high-quality boneless flesh, and has been cultivated for over 100 years in Eastern and Central Europe. The interest in rearing S. glanis continues to grow; the aquaculture production of this species has almost doubled during the last decade. However, despite its high ecological, cultural and economic importance, the available genomic resources for S. glanis are very limited. To fulfill this gap we report a de novo assembly and annotation of the whole genome sequence of a female S. glanis The linked-read based technology with 10X Genomics Chromium chemistry and Supernova assembler produced a highly continuous draft genome of S. glanis: â¼0.8Gb assembly (scaffold N 50 = 3.2 Mb; longest individual scaffold = 13.9 Mb; BUSCO completeness = 84.2%), which included 313.3 Mb of putative repeated sequences. In total, 21,316 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 96% were annotated functionally from either sequence homology or protein signature searches.

The feasibility and safety of surfactant delivery in COVID-19 ARDS patients have not been established. METHODS: We performed retrospective analyses of data from patients receiving off-label use of exogenous natural surfactant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven COVID-19 PCR positive ARDS patients received liquid Curosurf (720 mg) in 150 ml normal saline, divided into five 30 ml aliquots) and delivered via a bronchoscope into second-generation bronchi. Patients were matched with 14 comparable subjects receiving supportive care for ARDS during the same time period. Feasibility and safety were examined as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS: Patients showed no evidence of acute decompensation following surfactant installation into minor bronchi. Cox regression showed a reduction of 28-days mortality within the surfactant group, though not significant. The surfactant did not increase the duration of ventilation, and health care providers did not convert to COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Surfactant delivery through bronchoscopy at a dose of 720 mg in 150 ml normal saline is feasible and safe for COVID-19 ARDS patients and health care providers during the pandemic. Surfactant administration did not cause acute decompensation, may reduce mortality and mechanical ventilation duration in COVID-19 ARDS patients. This study supports the future performance of randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of meticulous sub-bronchial lavage with surfactant as treatment for patients with COVID-19 ARDS.","Piva, Simone; DiBlasi, Robert M; Slee, April E; Jobe, Alan H; Roccaro, Aldo M; Filippini, Matteo; Latronico, Nicola; Bertoni, Michele; Marshall, John C; Portman, Michael A",Respir Res,432,26

In this letter, the""infection performance""is evaluated by means of a mutual information analysis, and by an even simpler probabilistic performance measure which is closely related to absorbed viruses. The so-called infection rate depends on the distribution of the channel input events as well as on the transition probabilities between channel input and output events. The infection rate is investigated analytically for five basic discrete memoryless channel models. Numerical results for the transition probabilities are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for pathogen-laden particle transmission in four typical indoor environments: two-person office, corridor, classroom, and bus.

We analysed data from a large provider of long-term care for older people to investigate infection and mortality during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: Cohort study of 179 UK care homes with 9,339 residents and 11,604 staff. We used manager-reported daily tallies to estimate the incidence of suspected and confirmed infection and mortality in staff and residents. Individual-level electronic health records from 8,713 residents were used to model risk factors for confirmed infection, mortality, and estimate attributable mortality. RESULTS: 2,075/9,339 residents developed COVID-19 symptoms (22.2% [95% confidence interval: 21.4%; 23.1%]), while 951 residents (10.2% [9.6%; 10.8%]) and 585 staff (5.0% [4.7%; 5.5%]) had laboratory-confirmed infections. The incidence of confirmed infection was 152.6 [143.1; 162.6] and 62.3 [57.3; 67.5] per 100,000 person-days in residents and staff respectively. 121/179 (67.6%) care homes had at least one COVID-19 infection or COVID-19-related death. Lower staffing ratios and higher occupancy rates were independent risk factors for infection. 217/607 residents with confirmed infection died (case-fatality rate: 35.7% [31.9%; 39.7%]). Mortality in residents with no direct evidence of infection was two-fold higher in care homes with outbreaks versus those without (adjusted HR 2.2 [1.8; 2.6]). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest many deaths occurred in people who were infected with COVID-19, but not tested. Higher occupancy and lower staffing levels were independently associated with risks of infection. Protecting staff and residents from infection requires regular testing for COVID-19 and fundamental changes to staffing and care home occupancy.","Dutey-Magni, Peter F; Williams, Haydn; Jhass, Arnoupe; Rait, Greta; Lorencatto, Fabiana; Hemingway, Harry; Hayward, Andrew; Shallcross, Laura",Age ageing,432,29

Provision of support for these challenges is complicated by the high number of people requiring support and the need to maintain physical distancing. This motivated us to launch Text4Hope, a daily supportive texting messaging program, in Canada to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic amongst Canadians. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in stress, anxiety, and depression levels after six weeks of exposure to daily supportive text messages. METHODS: We used self-administered, online, empirically-supported questionnaires to assess demographic and clinical characteristics of subscribers. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depression were measured with the Perceived Stress Scale-10 Items (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale at baseline and sixth week time points. Moderate or high perceived stress, likely GAD and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were assessed using cut-off scores of PSS-10 &#8805; 14, GAD-7 &#8805; 10, and PHQ-9 &#8805; 10, respectively. After six-weeks into the program, 766 participants completed the questionnaires at both time points. RESULTS: At the sixth week time-point, there were statistically significant reductions in mean scores on the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scales, but not the PHQ-9 scale. Effect sizes were small overall. There were statistically significant reductions in the prevalence rates for moderate or high stress, likely GAD, and likely MDD for the group that completed both the baseline and sixth week assessments. The biggest reduction in mean scores and prevalence rates was for anxiety; 18.7% and 13.5% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope is a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means for implementing a population-level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant reduction in anxiety and stress during the COVD-19 pandemic and could be used as a population-level mental health intervention during natural disasters and other emergencies.

It is also unknown whether chromosomal structural mutations (SVs) contribute to the immunogenicity in acral and mucosal melanomas where such aberrations are common. We stained 151 cutaneous and 35 acral and mucosal melanoma patient samples using quantitative IHC and correlated immune infiltrate phenotypes with TMB and other genomic profiles. TMB and SVs did not correlate with the densities of CD8+ lymphocytes, CD103+ tumor-resident T cells (Trm), CD45RO+ cells, and other innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in cutaneous and acral/mucosal melanoma tumors, respectively, including in analyses restricted to the site of disease, and in a validation cohort. In 43 stage III treatment-naïve cutaneous melanoma patients, we found that the density of immune cells, particularly Trm, was significantly associated with patient survival but not with TMB.

Pharmacists faced many challenges such as incorporating safety measures, changes in working schedule and workload, and meeting specific patients' needs. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore and compare the community pharmacists' roles, practices, implemented safety measures, and psychological toll in Croatia and Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study employing an online survey was conducted in 2 countries over a period of 6 weeks during 2020. The survey consisted of 65 items that explored sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their workplaces, including safety measures, pharmaceutical care, and their psychology while working during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 574 pharmacists participated in the study, of which, 90% were female, with a mean age of 38 years (interquartile range 30.5-47). The study identified new pharmacists' roles that evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic: manufacturing hand sanitizers in community pharmacies, online patient counseling, and home delivery of medicines. Croatian and Serbian pharmacists exhibited disparities in their incorporated safety measures (higher for Croatia; P &#8804; 0.001) and satisfaction with work organization and counseling activities (higher for Serbia; P < 0.001). Serbian participants were less satisfied with the public perception of their role during the pandemic, and overall satisfaction was low, with a negative impact on mood and productivity. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the implications for community pharmacists during the pandemic in both countries. The extent of systematic and logistical support provided to them during the pandemic could be an explanation for the highlighted differences. It is imperative to develop a more effective strategy to counter potential health crises to ensure a better response from primary care pharmacists in the future.","Novak, Helena; Tadic, Ivana; Falamic, Slaven; Ortner Hadziabdic, Maja",,432,1

R0 values vary depending on social activity and type of gathering events that induce infection transmissibility and its pathophysiology dependence. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we estimated the probable outbreak size of COVID-19 clusters mathematically using a simple model that can predict the number of COVID-19 cases as a function of time. METHODS: We proposed a mathematical model to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in an outbreak occurring in both local and international clusters in light of published data. Different types of clusters (religious, wedding, and industrial activity) were selected based on reported events in different countries between February and April 2020. RESULTS: The highest R0 values were found in wedding party events (5), followed by religious gathering events (2.5), while the lowest value was found in the industrial cluster (2). In return, this will enable us to assess the trend of coronavirus spread by comparing the model results and observed patterns. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides predictive COVID-19 transmission patterns in different cluster types based on different R0 values. This model offers a contact-tracing task with the predicted number of cases, to decision-makers; this would help them in epidemiological investigations by knowing when to stop.","Saidan, Motasem N; Shbool, Mohammad A; Arabeyyat, Omar Suleiman; Al-Shihabi, Sameh T; Abdallat, Yousef Al; Barghash, Mahmoud A; Saidan, Hakam",Int J Infect Dis,432,1

Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention. Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes. However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available.

The duality serves as an instrument of the state in the broader governance negotiation of private capital accumulation and public welfare. The contemporary COVID-19 pandemic provides the opportunity to reconsider relationships between planning, design, and public health, and the politics and policies that constitute and mediate these relationships.

Impaired fibrinolysis has been proposed as an underlying mechanism. Our objective was to determine if fibrinolysis stimulated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) differed between COVID patients and controls. Plasma from 14 COVID patients on prophylactic heparin therapy was obtained and compared with heparinized plasma from 14 different healthy donors to act as controls. Kaolin activated thromboelastography with heparinase was utilized to obtain baseline measurements and then repeated with the addition of 4 nM tPA. Baseline fibrinogen levels were higher in COVID plasma as measured by maximum clot amplitude (43.6 ± 6.9 mm vs. 23.2 ± 5.5 mm, p < 0.0001) and Clauss assay (595 ± 135 mg/dL vs. 278 ± 44 mg/dL, p < 0.0001). With the addition of tPA, fibrinolysis at 30 min after MA (LY30%) was lower (37.9 ± 16.5% vs. 58.9 ± 18.3%, p = 0.0035) and time to 50% lysis was longer (48.8 ± 16.3 vs. 30.5 ± 15.4 min, p = 0.0053) in the COVID-19 samples. Clotting times and rate of fibrin polymerization ('R' or '&#945;' parameters) were largely the same in both groups. Clot from COVID patients contains a higher fibrin content compared to standard controls and shows resistance to fibrinolysis induced by tPA. These findings suggest the clinical efficacy of thrombolytics may be reduced in COVID-19 patients.","Maier, Cheryl L; Sarker, Tania; Szlam, Fania; Sniecinski, Roman M",J. thromb. thrombolysis,432,0

In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants (N = 14 393; observations = 48 486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). RESULTS: The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score â©¾3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%) 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI 14.3-22.9%), followed by females and high-income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a pronounced and prolonged deterioration in mental health occurred as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the UK between April and June 2020.","Daly, Michael; Sutin, Angelina R; Robinson, Eric",Psychol Med,432,1

Academic health centers rapidly deployed and leveraged telemedicine to permit uninterrupted care of patients. Telemedicine enjoys high patient satisfaction, yet little is known about the level of satisfaction during a crisis and to what extent patient- or visit-related factors and trust play when in-person visits are eliminated. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine correlates of patients’ satisfaction with a telemedicine visit. Methods: In this retrospective observational study conducted in our single-institution, urban, academic medical center in Los Angeles, internal medicine patients aged ≥18 years who completed a telemedicine visit between March 10th and April 17th, 2020, were invited for a survey (n=1624). Measures included patient demographics, degree of interpersonal trust in patient-physician relationships (using the Trust in Physician Scale), and visit-related concerns. Statistical analysis used descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation, and linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results: Of 1624 telemedicine visits conducted during this period, 368 (22.7%) patients participated in the survey. Across the study, respondents were very satisfied (173/365, 47.4%) or satisfied (n=129, 35.3%) with their telemedicine visit. Higher physician trust was associated with higher patient satisfaction (Spearman correlation r=0.51, P&lt;.001). Visit-related factors with statistically significant correlation with Trust in Physician score were technical issues with the telemedicine visit (r=–0.16), concerns about privacy (r=–0.19), concerns about cost (r=–0.23), satisfaction with telemedicine convenience (r=0.41), and amount of time spent (r=0.47;all P&lt;.01). Visit-related factors associated with patients’ satisfaction included fewer technical issues (P&lt;.001), less concern about privacy (P&lt;.001) or cost (P=.02), and successful face-to-face video (P&lt;.001). The only patient variable with a significant positive association was income and level of trust in physician (r=0.18, P&lt;.001). Younger age was associated with higher satisfaction with the telemedicine visit (P=.005). Conclusions: There have been calls for redesigning primary care after the COVID-19 pandemic and for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Patients’ satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Their satisfaction is shaped by the degree of trust in physician and visit-related factors more so than patient factors. This has widespread implications for outpatient practices and further research into visit-related factors and the patient-provider connection over telemedicine is needed.","Orrange, Sharon Patel Arpna Mack Wendy Jean Cassetta Julia",JMIR Human Factors,432,16

Antibodies binding to either JS7 or the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD, as well as those that disrupt binding between a fragment of the ACE2 receptor and the RBD, are proportional to disease severity and clinical outcome. Binding to JS7 was inhibited by linear peptides from the RBD interface with ACE2. Variants of JS7, such as E484K or N501Y, can be quickly synthesized in pure form in large quantities by automated methods.

Results It is predicted the incidence of public health emergencies would decrease in February compared with that in January, 2021 and would be dramatically lower compared with the same period in 2020. The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outside China has shown decline trend, but the disease will continue to spread at a very high level. China still face risks of both ongoing local transmission and the imported cases from other countries. Given the sensitive surveillance and rapid response capacity across the country and strengthened prevention and control measures taken before and after the Spring Festival according the national strategy, the possibility of new COVID-19 epidemic in China is very low.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study examines pregnant women with COVID-19 in the five Nordic countries. Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 30 June 2020 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test &#8804;14 days prior to admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID-19-related. RESULTS: In the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women required hospital care due to COVID-19. The risk of admission due to COVID-19 was 0.4/1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland and Norway, and 3.8/1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID-19 were more frequently obese (p < 0.001) and had a migrant background (p < 0.001) compared with the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Among the 56 women admitted due to COVID-19, 48 women delivered 51 infants. Preterm delivery (n = 12, 25%, p < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n = 21, 43.8%, p < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID-19 compared with women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of admission due to COVID-19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries. National public health policies appear to have had an impact on the risk of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy.

In early 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic forced communities around the globe to shut down and isolate. Routine graduate medical education activities have also been suspended as resident and fellow physicians-in-training have been re-deployed to support critical patient care services. Innovation. We developed a two-part hybrid telesimulation model to teach COVID-19 ventilator management strategies while physically separating a group of learners and an instructor from one another. Learners consisted of non-ICU health care providers with limited experience in ventilator management being redeployed to manage ICU level COVID-19 infected patients. In the first week, the video tutorial has been viewed over 500 times and we have facilitated 14 telesimulation sessions, including 48 participants comprised of hospitalists, emergency medicine physicians and physician assistants, pediatric residents, nurses, and a nurse educator. Conclusion. We believe that the combination of a video tutorial followed by an interactive telesimulation was successful in providing timely education during a coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, it reinforced the value and flexibility in which simulation education could continue conveniently for learners despite significant restrictions in place during the coronavirus pandemic. Research is needed to assess the efficacy of this hybrid intervention in preparing healthcare workers and to determine if the knowledge is successfully transferred to the clinical setting.","Naik, Neel; Finkelstein, Robert Alan; Howell, Joy; Rajwani, Kapil; Ching, Kevin",Simul.

Despite the national goals and the existence of comprehensive testing for the detection of asymptomatic or presymptomatic SARS-CoV­2 infections in all inpatients, no equivalent screening with rapid antigen tests has yet been established for outpatients. The acceptance of such screening with associated waiting times and inconvenience for affected patients has been insufficiently investigated. OBJECTIVE: We performed a self-administered anonymous survey of outpatients on their willingness to comply with the hygiene requirements, to undergo rapid antigen screening tests for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV­2 and to receive SARS-CoV­2 vaccination. RESULTS: From 7 to 15 December 2020, 534 patients completed the survey, 195 (37%) from rheumatism and 339 (63%) from orthopedic outpatient clinics. Most patients accepted wearing a mouth-nose covering (475/534, 89%) and attending clinics without an accompanying person to prevent overcrowding of the waiting areas (450/534, 84%). A large majority (428/534 patients, 80%) accepted mandatory screening with rapid antigen tests and the associated waiting time of 15-20â¯min outside the hospital (449/534, 84%). More than half of the responders reported willingness to receive a SARS-CoV­2 vaccination (yes, immediately 137 (26%), yes, maybe 142 (27%) patients), with significantly (pâ¯<â¯0.05) more male, more rheumatic and more patients older than 60 years indicating a wish to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The results revealed a high acceptance of COVID-19 hygiene measures including initial screening by rapid antigen testing.","Ehrenstein, Boris; Schwarz, Timo; Fleck, Martin; Günther, Florian",Z Rheumatol,432,11

Here we characterize the neutralizing antibodies produced in two subjects who received combination immunizations against SARS-CoV-2, first with Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine, followed 33 days later with a second dose (booster) shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Serum samples were collected 25 days following the primary vaccination and 13 days after the secondary Pfizer vaccination. Both subjects exhibited increased levels of isotype IgG and IgM antibodies directed against the entire spike protein following immunizations. These antibodies also exhibited increased reactivity with the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein and neutralized the infectivity of replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that contains the COVID-19 coronavirus S protein gene in place of its normal G glycoprotein. This VSV pseudovirus also contains the reporter gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Antibody titers against the spike protein and serum neutralization titers against the reporter virus are reported for the 2 heterologous vaccinated individuals and compared to a positive control derived from a convalescent patient and a negative control from an unexposed individual. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine increased antibody binding to the spike protein and RBD, and approached levels found in the convalescent positive control. Neutralizing antibodies against the VSV-S pseudovirus in the 2 subjects also approached levels in the convalescent sera. These results firmly validate the value of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in boosting immunity following initial Covishield inoculation.","Ostadgavahi, Ali Toloue; Booth, Ryan; Sisson, Gary; McMullen, Nichole; Warhuus, Michelle; Robertson, Peter; Miller, Matthew; Allen, Wanda C; El Sherif, May; Brownlie, Robert; Falzarano, Darryl; Richardson, Christopher D",J Infect Dev Ctries,432,28

METHODS: The authors describe the cases of 2 patients who died from COVID-related complications after acute cervical SCI. RESULTS: Patients with SCI are at increased risk of pulmonary complications. COVID-19 infection represents a double hit in this patient population, increasing potential morbidity and mortality in the perioperative time frame. Careful consideration must be made regarding the timing of potential surgical intervention in the treatment of acute SCI. CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide database of COVID-positive patients with acute spinal cord injury should be collected and analyzed to better understand how to manage acute SCI in the COVID-19 era.

Prior empirical studies have shown that adult children of Holocaust survivors (OHS, also referred to in select quotes as 2G for ""Second Generation"") are vulnerable to life-threatening situations. This study aimed to examine the reactions of OHS to the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed a serious threat to the lives of many, in particular to older adults. As they enter middle age, OHS were observed to have more medical health issues and less positive perceptions of their own aging relative to peers. Less positive subjective aging was associated with more negative psychiatric symptoms in relation to Covid-19-related loneliness, further suggesting that OHS are a group of aging adults with particular vulnerabilities to negative mental health effects of the pandemic and of the social distancing and isolation it imposed. This study is a qualitative report of experiences expressed by over 1,200 participants in several web-based interactive webinars for OHS during the period of ""shelter at home"" in March and April 2020.

Participants were asked to express their level of agreement with the early-release of hypothetical prisoners. Results showed participants to be less favourable to the early-release of Black compared to White prisoners, when they had committed a stereotypically Black crime. As expected, the congruency between the crime stereotypicality and the colour of the prisoner's skin did not emerge for White prisoners. Moreover, the difference between the agreement with the release of the Black vs. the White prisoner when both committed a stereotypically Black crime was higher as the level of endorsement of Meritocracy increased. Contrastingly, Anti-egalitarianism only predicted an overall disagreement with prisoners' early-release.

Specifically, we focused on the relationships between ICT use and perceived importance of social connectedness and future anxiety, while considering relevant personality and psychosocial factors. A U.S. sample of 394 adults answered questions about ICT use, pandemic-related reactions and actions, demographics, and psychosocial factors via an online survey. Using logistic regression, findings indicated that personality (extraversion and conscientiousness) and psychosocial (need to belong and perceived attachment to phone) factors, types of ICT as news source, and gender were associated with perceived importance of social connectedness. Neuroticism, time spent on ICT for social purposes, and perceived threat of COVID-19 were associated with future anxiety. In addition, using Mann-Whitney U test, people who rated higher on importance of social connectedness had higher ICT use, both in terms of types and time spent on ICT. Overall, results are consistent with the idea that technology is a coping tool during the pandemic and balanced use can lead to feelings of social connectedness and less future anxiety. Therefore, it is important for authorities to align their messaging and outreach with people's psychosocial, personality, and health considerations through ICT channels while empowering ICT users to be responsible for their interactions with the technology.","Lee, Yi-Ching; Malcein, Lindsey A; Kim, Sojung Claire",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),432,1

The underlying cause(s) remain incompletely understood. In this study, in patients with an influenza A/H1N1 virus infection, viral load and platelet count correlated inversely during the acute infection phase. We confirmed this finding in a ferret model of influenza virus infection. In these animals, platelet count decreased with the degree of virus pathogenicity varying from 0% in animals infected with the influenza A/H3N2 virus, to 22% in those with the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus, up to 62% in animals with a highly pathogenic A/H5N1 virus infection. This thrombocytopenia is associated with virus-containing platelets that circulate in the blood. Uptake of influenza virus particles by platelets requires binding to sialoglycans and results in the removal of sialic acids by the virus neuraminidase, a trigger for hepatic clearance of platelets. We propose the clearance of influenza virus by platelets as a paradigm. These insights clarify the pathophysiology of influenza virus infection and show how severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, may propagate thrombocytopenia and/or thromboembolic complications.","Jansen, A J Gerard; Spaan, Thom; Low, Hui Zhi; Di Iorio, Daniele; van den Brand, Judith; Tieke, Malte; Barendrecht, Arjan; Rohn, Kerstin; van Amerongen, Geert; Stittelaar, Koert; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Osterhaus, Albert; Kuiken, Thijs; Boons, Geert-Jan; Huskens, Jurriaan; Boes, Marianne; Maas, Coen; van der Vries, Erhard",Blood Adv,432,16

Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. METHODS: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""quarantine"") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. RESULTS: Popular unigrams included ""virus,"" ""lockdown,"" and ""quarantine."" Popular bigrams included ""COVID-19,"" ""stay home,"" ""corona virus,"" ""social distancing,"" and ""new cases."" We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world.

The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning. Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, Chengda; Su, Yue; Zhu, Tingshao",J Med Internet Res,432,16

Such lockdown coupled with school closures and stay-at-home orders made women more vulnerable in terms of higher responsibility and spending more time with an abusive partner, if any. Methods: This study investigates the situation of women during COVID-19 induced lockdown by focusing on their happiness and inquiring about the incidence of violence. Using the zero-inflated negative binomial model, our findings ascertained that family settings, type of relationship with a spouse, and age significantly affects the positive count of violence during the lockdown. We further estimated the determinants of happiness and found that years of schooling, the role of women in household decision making, and feeling empowered is affecting their happiness. Results: Women having higher education have more odds of zero violence. Unemployed women and women who are not working have higher odds of zero violence as compared to women who are working. During this lockdown after the COVID-19 pandemic, women living in urban areas, having higher education, having an adequate household income to meet the expenditures, having lesser anxiety, not facing violence, feeling empowered when their husband is around, and have higher decision-making power are happier. Discussion and conclusion: The study is important in the context of happiness and violence inflicted on women during the lockdown and provides the basis to improve the pandemic response policy. The inclusion of women's safety and happiness in pandemic response policy is important to ensure the well-being of women and to devise better health and economic policy. Our estimates suggest higher education results in less incidence of violence which could be argued as desirable outcomes for building healthy, productive, and happy communities. In addition to this, as pandemic induced lock-down is likely to result in higher unemployment across the globe including Pakistan, therefore, in light of our estimates pertaining to the role of unemployment in the incidence of violence, policymakers should deploy more resources to enhance income and to combat the rising unemployment.

Previous studies have observed highly variable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with COVID-19. However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have yet to be reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies. Herein, we describe the relationship between GGT levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Our study is a retrospective case series of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital in Wenzhou, China, from January 17 to February 5, 2020. Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed by symptomatology, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team. Of the 98 patients evaluated, elevated GGT levels were observed in 32.7%; increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in 22.5%, 13.3%, and 20.4%, respectively; and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglycerides (TGs) were found in 2% and 21.4%, respectively. Initially, in the 82 patients without chronic liver disease and alcohol history; age older than 40 years (P = 0.027); male gender (P = 0.0145); elevated CRP (P = 0.0366), ALT (P < 0.0001), and ALP (P = 0.0003); and increased TGs (P = 0.0002) were found to be associated with elevated GGT levels. Elevated GGT (P = 0.0086) and CRP (P = 0.0162) levels have a longer length of hospital stay. Conclusion: A sizable number of patients with COVID-19 infection had elevated serum GGT levels. This elevation supports involvement of the liver in persons with COVID-19.","Shao, Tuo; Tong, Yu; Lu, Shushu; Jeyarajan, Andre J; Su, Feifei; Dai, Jianyi; Shi, Jichan; Huang, Jianping; Hu, Chenchan; Wu, Lianpeng; Dai, Xianning; Cheng, Zhimeng; Yan, Jiuliang; Huang, Peng; Tian, Yanzhang; Li, Shasha; Chung, Raymond T; Chen, Dong",,432,25

The rapid spread of the virus and the precipitously increasing numbers of cases necessitate the urgent development of accurate diagnostic methods, effective treatments, and vaccines. Here, we review the progress of developing diagnostic methods, therapies, and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on current clinical trials and their challenges. For diagnosis, nucleic acid amplification tests remain the mainstay diagnostics for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while serological antibody tests are used to aid contact tracing, epidemiological, and vaccine evaluation studies. Viral isolation is not recommended for routine diagnostic procedures due to safety concerns. Currently, no single effective drug or specific vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Some candidate drugs targeting different levels and stages of human responses against COVID-19 such as cell membrane fusion, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, viral protease inhibitor, interleukin 6 blocker, and convalescent plasma may improve the clinical outcomes of critical COVID-19 patients. Other supportive care measures for critical patients are still necessary. Advances in genetic sequencing and other technological developments have sped up the establishment of a variety of vaccine platforms. Accordingly, numerous vaccines are under development. Vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are mainly based upon the viral spike protein due to its vital role in viral infectivity, and most of these candidates have recently moved into clinical trials. Before the efficacy of such vaccines in humans is demonstrated, strong international coordination and collaboration among studies, pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and governments are needed to limit further damage due the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Shih, Hsin-I; Wu, Chi-Jung; Tu, Yi-Fang; Chi, Chia-Yu",Biomed J,432,16

Without these data, it is almost impossible for the state authorities to manage the epidemic and adopt rational measures. This article brings the results of a medium-sized seroprevalence study which was carried out in the spring of 2020 in South Bohemia. In the Strakonice and Písek regions, the ELISA method was used to test the prevalence of IgA and IgG antibodies in 2011 subjects, volunteers from general public and selected professions working in areas with a higher exposure to the infection. The study showed that already in May 2020, 2.9% of inhabitants of the Strakonice region and 1.9% of inhabitants of the Písek region had antibodies against the coronavirus. These numbers imply that for each PCR positive person, there were at least fifty others who had probably already undergone the infection. The article points out three types of problems that might occur in such a study. First, the study must be planned correctly, and possible outcomes must be pre-assessed. Second, an appropriate test must be selected with known parameters. This enables us to correctly estimate the share of false positive and false negative results. Third, the data must be evaluated in a reasonable way and correct inference must be performed. We offer a set of recommendations how to manage these issues and how to solve problems that inevitably arise in such a large-scale testing.","Krátká, Zuzana; Fürst, Tomás; Vencálek, Ondrej; Kurková, Vera; Simecková, Eva; Fleischmannová, Jana; Strojil, Jan; Kuba, Martin",Cas Lek Cesk,432,21

METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed. We systematically searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science, EMBASE, medRxiv and bioRxiv database through October 30, 2020. The primary and secondary outcomes were mortality and severe COVID-19, respectively. RESULTS: We included 25 studies with 22,734 COVID-19 patients, and we compared the outcomes between patients who did and did not receive ACEIs/ARBs. The use of ACEIs/ARBs was not associated with higher risks of severe disease (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.15, I2=38.55%), mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.61, 1.16, I2=3.19%), dialysis (OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.09, 2.39, I2=0.00%), or the length of hospital stay (SMD = 0.05, 95% CI: -0.16, 0.26, I2=84.43%) in COVID-19 patients. The effect estimates showed an overall protective effect of ACEIs/ARBs against mortality (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.85, I2= 73.37%), severity/mortality (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.95, I2=22.90%), transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) among COVID-19 patients with hypertension (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.53, I2=0.00%), hospitalization (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98, I2=0.00%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.95, I2=0.00%).

Some of the literatures pointed out that the pandemic is exhibiting seasonal patterns in its spread, incidence and nature of the distribution. In connection to the spread and distribution of the infection, scientific analysis that answers the questions whether the next summer can save people from COVID-19 is required. Many researchers have been exclusively asked whether high temperature during summer can slow down the spread of the COVID-19 as it has with other seasonal flues. Since there are a lot of questions that are unanswered right now, and many mysteries aspects about the COVID-19 that is still unknown to us, in-depth study and analysis of associated weather features are required. Moreover, understanding the nature of COVID-19 and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 request more investigation of the real effect of weather variables on the transmission of the COVID-19 among people. In this work, various regressor machine learning models are proposed to extract the relationship between different factors and the spreading rate of COVID-19. The machine learning algorithms employed in this work estimate the impact of weather variables such as temperature and humidity on the transmission of COVID-19 by extracting the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the weather variables on certain regions. To validate the proposed method, we have collected the required datasets related to weather and census features and necessary prepossessing is carried out. From the experimental results, it is shown that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the mortality rate when compared to the other census variables such as population, age, and urbanization. Thus, from this result, we can conclude that temperature and humidity are important features for predicting COVID-19 mortality rate. Moreover, it is indicated that the higher the value of temperature the lower number of infection cases.","Malki, Zohair; Atlam, El-Sayed; Hassanien, Aboul Ella; Dagnew, Guesh; Elhosseini, Mostafa A.; Gad, Ibrahim",Chaos Solitons Fractals,432,21

Descriptive statistics and mixed effects logistic regression were used to determine impactful patient predictors of telemedicine completion, while adjusting for clustering at the clinical site level. RESULTS: Many patient-specific demographics were found to be significant. Descriptive statistics showed older patients had lower rates of completion (p < 0.001). Also, Hispanic patients had statistically significant lower rates (p < 0.001). Overall, minorities (racial, ethnic, and language) had decreased odds ratios of successful telemedicine completion compared to the reference. DISCUSSION: While telemedicine use continues to be critical during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, entire populations struggle with access-possibly widening existing disparities. These results contribute large datasets with significant findings to the limited research on telemedicine access and can help guide us in improving telemedicine disparities across our health systems and on a wider scale.","Gmunder, Kristin N; Ruiz, Jose W; Franceschi, Dido; Suarez, Maritza M",J Telemed Telecare,432,16

Through the quantum light-matter interactions under the dipole Gauge, the molecular permanent dipoles polarize the photon field by displacing the photonic coordinate. Hence, it is convenient to use these shifted Fock states (referred to as the PFS) to describe light-matter interactions under the strong coupling regimes. These PFS are non-orthogonal to each other and are light-matter entangled states. They allow an intuitive understanding of several phenomena that go beyond the prediction of the quantum Rabi model, while also offering numerical convenience to converge the results with much fewer states. With this powerful new theoretical framework, we explain how molecular permanent dipoles lead to the generation of multiple photons from a single electronic excitation (downconversion), effectively achieving the dynamical Casimir effect through the nuclear vibration instead of the cavity mirror oscillations.","Mandal, Arkajit; Montillo Vega, Sebastian; Huo, Pengfei",J. phys. chem. lett,432,20

METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective observational study of all patients admitted with COVID-19 to Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The hospital was dedicated solely to the treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hypertension and the treatments were stratified according to the medical history or medications administrated prior to the infection. Among 2877 hospitalized patients, 29.5% (850/2877) had a history of hypertension. After adjustment for confounders, patients with hypertension had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of mortality as compared with patients without hypertension [4.0% vs. 1.1%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.82, P = 0.013]. Patients with a history of hypertension but without antihypertensive treatment (n = 140) were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with those with antihypertensive treatments (n = 730) (7.9% vs. 3.2%, adjusted HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.03-4.57, P = 0.041). The mortality rates were similar between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor (4/183) and non-RAAS inhibitor (19/527) cohorts (2.2% vs. 3.6%, adjusted HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28-2.58, P = 0.774). However, in a study-level meta-analysis of four studies, the result showed that patients with RAAS inhibitor use tend to have a lower risk of mortality (relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.94, P = 0.20). CONCLUSION: While hypertension and the discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment are suspected to be related to increased risk of mortality, in this retrospective observational analysis, we did not detect any harm of RAAS inhibitors in patients infected with COVID-19. However, the results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted cautiously.","Gao, Chao; Cai, Yue; Zhang, Kan; Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Xijing; Li, Qi; Li, Weiqin; Yang, Shiming; Zhao, Xiaoyan; Zhao, Yuying; Wang, Hui; Liu, Yi; Yin, Zhiyong; Zhang, Ruining; Wang, Rutao; Yang, Ming; Hui, Chen; Wijns, William; McEvoy, J William; Soliman, Osama; Onuma, Yoshinobu; Serruys, Patrick W; Tao, Ling; Li, Fei",Eur Heart J,432,16

Since T cells must race to cull infected cells, they are quick to differentiate and achieve cytotoxic function. With this responsiveness, comes hastened apoptosis, due to a coupled mechanism of death and differentiation in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes via CD95 (Fas) and serine-threonine kinase (Akt). T cell lymphopenia in severe cases may represent cell death or peripheral migration. These facets depict SARS-Cov-2 as a lympho-manipulative pathogen; it distorts T cell function, numbers, and death, and creates a dysfunctional immune response. Whether preservation of T cells, prevention of their aberrant differentiation, and expansion of their population may alter disease course is unknown.

We have investigated what factors related to the pandemic influenced hospital presentations following self-harm during lockdown in England. METHOD: Mental health clinicians assessing individuals aged 18 years and over presenting to hospitals in Oxford and Derby following self-harm during the period March 23rd to May 17, 2020 recorded whether the self-harm was related to the impact of COVID-19 and, if so, what specific factors were relevant. These factors were organized into a classification scheme. Information was also collected on patients' demographic characteristics, method of self-harm and suicide intent. RESULTS: Of 228 patients assessed, in 46.9% (N = 107) COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions were identified as influencing self-harm. This applied more to females than males (53.5%, N = 68/127 v 38.6%, N = 39/101, &#967;2 = 5.03, p = 0.025), but there were no differences in age, methods of self-harm or suicide intent between the two groups. The most frequent COVID-related factors were mental health issues, including new and worsening disorders, and cessation or reduction of services (including absence of face-to-face support), isolation and loneliness, reduced contact with key individuals, disruption to normal routine, and entrapment. Multiple, often inter-connected COVID-related factors were identified in many patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-related factors were identified as influences in nearly half of individuals presenting to hospitals following self-harm in the period following introduction of lockdown restrictions. Females were particularly affected. The fact that mental health problems, including issues with delivery of care, predominated has implications for organisation of services during such periods. The contribution of isolation, loneliness and sense of entrapment highlight the need for relatives, friends and neighbours to be encouraged to reach out to others, especially those living alone. The classification of COVID-related factors can be used as an aide-memoire for clinicians.","Hawton, Keith; Lascelles, Karen; Brand, Fiona; Casey, Deborah; Bale, Liz; Ness, Jennifer; Kelly, Samantha; Waters, Keith",J Psychiatr Res,432,0

METHODS: 135 patients with COVID-19 were reached by phone and subsequently included in the study. Olfactory functions were evaluated using a questionnaire for assessment of self-reported olfactory function. Patients were divided into four subgroups according to the presence of olfactory symptoms and temporal relationship with the other symptoms: group1 had only olfactory complaints (isolated, sudden-onset loss of smell); group2 had sudden-onset loss of smell, followed by COVID-19 related complaints; group3 initially had COVID-19 related complaints, then gradually developed olfactory complaints; and group4 had no olfactory complaints. RESULTS: In total, 59.3% of the patients interviewed had olfactory complaints during the disease course. The olfactory dysfunction severity during COVID-19 infection was significantly higher in group1 compared to groups 2 and 3. In groups1-3, the odor scores after recovery from COVID-19 disease were significantly lower compared to the status prior to disease onset. The residual olfactory dysfunction was similar between groups1 and 2, but was more evident than group3. Mean duration for loss of smell was 7.8 ± 3.1 (2-15) days. Duration of loss of smell was longer in groups1 and 2 than in group3. Odor scores completely returned back to the pre-disease values in 41 (51.2%) patients with olfactory dysfunction. Rate of complete olfactory dysfunction recovery was higher in group3 compared to groups1 and 2. CONCLUSION: In isolated anosmia cases, anosmia is more severe, and complete recovery rates are lower compared to the patients who have other clinical symptoms.

Compared with exposures in full occupancy scenarios, relative exposure in vacant middle seat scenarios was reduced by 23% to 57% depending upon the modeling approach. A 23% exposure reduction was observed for a single passenger who was in the same row and two seats away from the SARS-COV-2 source, rather than in an adjacent middle seat. When quantifying exposure reduction to a full 120-passenger cabin rather than to a single person, exposure reductions ranging from 35.0% to 39.4% were predicted. A 57% exposure reduction was observed under the vacant middle seat condition in a scenario involving a three-row section that contained a mix of SARS-CoV-2 sources and other passengers. Based on this laboratory model, a vacant middle seat reduces risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from nearby passengers. These data suggest that increasing physical distance between passengers and lowering passenger density could help reduce potential COVID-19 exposures during air travel. Physical distancing of airplane passengers, including through policies such as middle seat vacancy, could provide additional reductions in SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk.","Dietrich, W. L.; Bennett, J.

A condition of hypercoagulability has been frequently reported in COVID-19 patients, and this very fact may complicate KRT management. Sustained Low Efficiency Dialysis (SLED) is a hybrid dialysis modality increasingly used in critically ill patients since it allows to maintain acceptable hemodynamic stability and to overcome the increased clotting risk of the extracorporeal circuit, especially when Regional Citrate Anticoagulation (RCA) protocols are applied. Notably, given the mainly diffusive mechanism of solute transport, SLED is associated with lower stress on both hemofilter and blood cells as compared to convective KRT modalities. Finally, RCA, as compared with heparin-based protocols, does not further increase the already high hemorrhagic risk of patients with AKI. Based on these premises, we performed a pilot study on the clinical management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 associated AKI who underwent SLED with a simplified RCA protocol. Low circuit clotting rates were observed, as well as adequate KRT duration was achieved in most cases, without any relevant metabolic complication nor worsening of hemodynamic status.","Di Mario, Francesca; Regolisti, Giuseppe; Di Maria, Alessio; Parmigiani, Alice; Benigno, Giuseppe Daniele; Picetti, Edoardo; Barbagallo, Maria; Greco, Paolo; Maccari, Caterina; Fiaccadori, Enrico",J Crit Care,432,16

Using administrative discharge data, CDC assessed monthly trends in the proportion of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 among racial and ethnic groups in the United States during March-December 2020 by U.S. Census region. Cumulative and monthly age-adjusted COVID-19 proportionate hospitalization ratios (aPHRs) were calculated for racial and ethnic minority patients relative to non-Hispanic White patients. Within each of the four U.S. Census regions, the cumulative aPHR was highest for Hispanic or Latino patients (range = 2.7-3.9). Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization were largest during May-July 2020; the peak monthly aPHR among Hispanic or Latino patients was >9.0 in the West and Midwest, >6.0 in the South, and >3.0 in the Northeast. The aPHRs declined for most racial and ethnic groups during July-November 2020 but increased for some racial and ethnic groups in some regions during December. Disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization by race/ethnicity varied by region and became less pronounced over the course of the pandemic, as COVID-19 hospitalizations increased among non-Hispanic White persons. Identification of specific social determinants of health that contribute to geographic and temporal differences in racial and ethnic disparities at the local level can help guide tailored public health prevention strategies and equitable allocation of resources, including COVID-19 vaccination, to address COVID-19-related health disparities and can inform approaches to achieve greater health equity during future public health threats.","Romano, Sebastian D; Blackstock, Anna J; Taylor, Ethel V; El Burai Felix, Suad; Adjei, Stacey; Singleton, Christa-Marie; Fuld, Jennifer; Bruce, Beau B; Boehmer, Tegan K",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,432,1

Seventy-Seven genomes of recently emerged genotype 4 reassortant Eurasian avian-like H1N1 virus (G4-EA-H1N1) are currently available. We investigated the presence and variation of potential G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS), which can serve as targets for antiviral treatment. RESULTS: PQS were identified in all 77 genomes. The total number of PQS in G4-EA-H1N1 genomes was 571. Interestingly, the number of PQS per genome in individual close relative viruses varied from 4 to 12. PQS were not randomly distributed in the 8 segments of the G4-EA-H1N1 genome, the highest frequency of PQS being found in the NP segment (1.39 per 1000 nt), which is considered a potential target for antiviral therapy. In contrast, no PQS was found in the NS segment. Analyses of variability pointed the importance of some PQS; even if genome variation of influenza virus is extreme, the PQS with the highest G4Hunter score is the most conserved in all tested genomes. G-quadruplex formation in vitro was experimentally confirmed using spectroscopic methods. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here hint several G-quadruplex-forming sequences in G4-EA-H1N1 genomes, that could provide good therapeutic targets.","Brázda, Václav; Porubiaková, Otília; Cantara, Alessio; Bohálová, Natália; Coufal, Jan; Bartas, Martin; Fojta, Miroslav; Mergny, Jean-Louis",BMC Genomics,432,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the practical and ethical problems of allocating limited medical resources such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators became critical. Although different countries have proposed different guidelines to manage this emergency, these proposed criteria do not sufficiently consider people living with disabilities. People living with disabilities are therefore at a higher risk of exclusion from medical treatments as physicians tend to assume they have poor quality of life, whereas access to medical treatment should be based on several parameters, including clinical data and prognosis. However, the COVID-19 pandemic shifts the medical paradigm from person-centred medicine to community-centred medicine, challenging the main ethical theories. We reviewed the main guidelines and recommendations for resources allocation and examined their position toward persons with disabilities. Based on our findings, we propose criteria for not discriminating against people with disabilities in allocating resources. The shift from person-centred to community-centred medicine offers opportunities but also risks sacrificing the most vulnerable people. The principle of reasonable accommodation must always be considered to guarantee the rights of persons with disabilities.","Panocchia, Nicola; D039,; ambrosio, Viola; Corti, Serafino; Lo Presti, Eluisa; Bertelli, Marco; Scattoni, Maria Luisa; Ghelma, Filippo",J. med. ethics,432,31

Real-time population screening and identification of groups in whom positivity is highest could help monitor spread and inform public health messaging and strategy. MethodsTo develop a real-time screening process, we included results from nose and throat swabs and questionnaires taken 19 July 2020-17 July 2021 in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey. Fortnightly, associations between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and 60 demographic and behavioural characteristics were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, considering multiple testing, collinearity, and reverse causality. FindingsOf 4,091,537 RT-PCR results from 482,677 individuals, 29,903 (0{middle dot}73%) were positive. As positivity rose September-November 2020, rates were independently higher in younger ages, and those living in Northern England, major urban conurbations, more deprived areas, and larger households. Rates were also higher in those returning from abroad, and working in healthcare or outside of home. When positivity peaked December 2020-January 2021 (Alpha), high positivity shifted to southern geographical regions. With national vaccine roll-out from December 2020, positivity reduced in vaccinated individuals. Associations attenuated as rates decreased between February-May 2021. Rising positivity rates in June-July 2021 (Delta) were independently higher in younger, male, and unvaccinated groups. Few factors were consistently associated with positivity. 25/45 (56%) confirmed associations would have been detected later using 28-day rather than 14-day periods. InterpretationPopulation-level demographic and behavioural surveillance can be a valuable tool in identifying the varying characteristics driving current SARS-CoV-2 positivity, allowing monitoring to inform public health policy.

They differ for the measurement of IL-6 levels. In patients with COVID-19 disease the inflammatory response plays a crucial role leading to cytochine storm responsible of multiple organ damage. In this population, levels of IL-6 have been measured as indicator of inflammatory status. Aim of the study is to compare prognostic performance of both scores in predicting ICU mortality between patients with COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A single centre, retrospective, cohort study on patients admitted in ICU with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was performed. Prognostic performance of NUTRIC score and mNUTRIC score were assessed and compared for discriminative abilities for ICU-mortality. RESULTS: 43 patients were enrolled, age 64 (55; 70), BMI 28 ± 4. Mean NUTRIC score was 2.5 ± 1, mNUTRIC was 2.6 ± 1.1. Mortality was 39.5%, all patients had low nutritional risk according to both scores (&#8804;5 and &#8804; 4 for NUTRIC and mNUTRIC score respectively). The discriminative ability of Nutric Score for ICU mortality was 0.675 (95% CI: 0.524-0.825), while that of mNutric score was 0.655 (0.513-0.861), p = 0.667. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic performance of Nutric score and mNutric score is comparable, but the discriminative ability is low even in patients with high inflammatory status as in COVID-19 affected population. These scores may not be appropriate in patients with COVID-19 for the determination of nutritional risk.","Liberti, Annalisa; Piacentino, Edoardo; Umbrello, Michele; Muttini, Stefano",Clin Nutr ESPEN,432,29

There are two directions of exploration. One is to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or syntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit small-world and scale-free features. The other direction of exploration is to study networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for modeling language change. Four types of social networks are compared, which exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.","Jinyun, KE",,432,20

We hypothesized that countries with previous exposure to SARS and MERS were significantly more likely to have fewer cases and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We retrieved the incidence of COVID-19 per 100,000 population within 30 days since the first confirmed case was reported from the 2019 Novel COVID-19 data repository by the Johns Hopkins Centre for Systems Science and Engineering for 94 countries. The association between previous exposure to SARS and/or MERS and the 30-day COVID-19 incidence rate was examined by multivariable linear regression analysis, whilst controlling for potential confounders including the INFORM COVID-19 Risk Index, Testing Policies, Democracy Index, Scientific Citation Index, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Human Development Index (HDI) and the population density of each country. We found that countries with previous exposure to SARS and/or MERS epidemics were significantly more likely to have lower incidence of COVID-19 (ß coefficient - 225.6, 95% C.I. - 415.8,- 35.4, p = 0.021).

Methods 235 tissue donors at the Lille Tissue Bank between November 1, 2019 and March 16, 2020 were included. Archived serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two FDA-approved kits. Results Most donors were at higher risks for severe COVID-19 illness including age over 65 years (142/235) and/or presence of co-morbidities (141/235). According to the COVID-19 risk assessment of transmission, 183 out of 235 tissue donors presented with a low risk level and 52 donors with an intermediate risk level of donor derived infection. Four out of the 235 (1.7%) tested specimens were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 2 donors with anti-N protein IgG and 2 other donors with anti-S protein total Ig. None of them had both type of antibodies. Conclusion Regarding the seroprevalence among tissue donors, we concluded that the transmission probability to recipient via tissue products was very low at the beginning of the outbreak.","Germain, Nicolas; Herwegh, Stéphanie; Hatzfeld, Anne-Sophie; Bocket, Laurence; Prévost, Brigitte; Danzé, Pierre-Marie; Marchetti, Philippe",Cell tissue bank,432,24

The COVID-19 pandemic poses enormous challenges to healthcare teams and patients when ensuring guideline compliance. We explored the implications of COVID-19 on physical activity levels in adult CHD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A data-based questionnaire was distributed to adult CHD patients at a regional tertiary centre from October to November 2020. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 96 (79.3%) of 125 respondents reported participating in regular physical activity, with 66 (52.8%) meeting target levels (moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week). Commonest motivations for physical activity were general fitness (53.6%), weight loss (36.0%), and mental health benefits (30.4%). During the pandemic, the proportion that met target levels significantly decreased from 52.8% to 40.8% (p = 0.03). The commonest reason was fear of COVID-19 (28.0%), followed by loss of motivation (23.2%) and gym/fitness centre closure (15.2%). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted exercise levels of adult CHD patients. Most do not meet recommended physical activity levels, mainly attributable to fear of COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, only half of respondents met physical activity guidelines. Availability of online classes can positively impact exercise levels so could enhance guideline compliance. This insight into health perceptions and behaviours of adult CHD patients may help develop quality improvement initiatives to improve physical activity levels in this population.","Thompson, Sophie E; Whitehead, Caitlin A; Notley, Alex S; Guy, Isabel A; Kasargod Prabhakar, Chethan R; Clift, Paul; Hudsmith, Lucy E",Cardiol Young,432,1

METHODS: Telemedicine service was established by Faisalabad Medical University at two of its affiliated locations: (i) a 24-hour COVID-19 Telephone Helpline was established at the Director Emergency Office, Allied Hospital, and District Headquarter (DHQ) Hospital. (ii) A Telemedicine Clinic comprising consultants and postgraduate residents from different specialties was established at Chief Office, Allied Hospital. The data related to the number and categories of calls and advice provided were collected from 27th March 2020 to 31st July 2020. RESULTS: A total of 4582 calls were received, at both locations, during the study period, out of which 2325 callers (51%) were male, and 2257 (49%) were females. At Allied Hospital, 172 patients were advised accordingly for their complaints, whereas, at DHQ Hospital, 320 patients were advised accordingly for their complaints. At the Telemedicine Clinic only, a total of 2436 calls were received during the study period, 1474 (60%) callers were male, and 962 (40%) were female. The majority of the calls were received by medicine (43%), dermatology (21%), and paediatrics (11%) specialties, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations, the benefits of telemedicine in this COVID-19 era are enormous and it is feasible to implement telemedicine services in developing countries. The developing countries must invest in the internet and technology access to facilitate telemedicine and other e-health services for not only curbing this pandemic but also to promote a more efficient healthcare system after the pandemic.","Nagra, Muhammad Haneef; Ehsan, Sumaira; Ahmad, Umair; Ali, Majid; Hussain, Hafiz Amjad; Bakar, Abu",Int J Clin Pract,432,16

METHODS: The population migration was embedded in the SEIR model to simulate and analyze the effects of the amount of population inflow on the number of confirmed cases. Based on numerical simulations, this study used statistical data for the empirical validation of its theoretical deductions and discussed how to improve the effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control considering population migration variables. Statistics regarding the numbers of infected people in various provinces were obtained from the epidemic-related data reported by China's National Health Commission. RESULTS: This study explored how the epidemic should be prevented and controlled from the perspective of population migration variables. It found that the combination of a susceptible population, an infected population, and transmission media were important routes affecting the number of infections and that the migration of a Hubei-related infected population played a key role in promoting epidemic spread. Epidemic prevention and control should focus on regions with better economic conditions than the epidemic region. Prevention and control efforts should focus on the more populated neighboring provinces having convenient transportation links with the epidemic region. To prevent and control epidemic spread, priority should be given to elucidating the destinations and directions of population migration from the domestic origin of infections, and then controlling population migration or human-to-human contact after such migration. CONCLUSIONS: This study enriched and expanded on simulations of the effects of population migration on the COVID-19 epidemic and China-based empirical studies while offering an epidemic evaluation and warning mechanism to prevent and control similar public health emergencies in the future.","Hu, Zhen; Wu, Yuanyang; Su, Mohan; Xie, Lin; Zhang, Anqi; Lin, Xueyu; Nie, Yafeng",BMC Public Health,432,23

Urgent studies to identify new antiviral drugs, repurpose existing drugs, or identify drugs that can target the overactive immune response are ongoing. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have been tested in past human coronavirus infections, and also against SARS-CoV-2, but a trial of lopinavir and ritonavir failed to show any clinical benefit in COVID-19. However, there is limited data as to the course of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, with some studies showing a decreased mortality for those taking certain ARV regimens. We hypothesized that ARVs other than lopinavir and ritonavir might be responsible for some protection against the progression of COVID-19. Here, we used chemoinformatic analyses to predict which ARVs would bind and potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) or RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) enzymes in silico. The drugs predicted to bind the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro included the protease inhibitors atazanavir and indinavir. The ARVs predicted to bind the catalytic site of the RdRp included Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, abacavir, emtricitabine, zidovudine, and tenofovir. Existing or new combinations of antiretroviral drugs could potentially prevent or ameliorate the course of COVID-19 if shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in clinical trials.

Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted by administering a well-structured questionnaire comprising of three sections including knowledge, attitude and practice amongst health care professionals in various hospitals and clinics, over a duration of two months ‘Feb-March’ 2020. The data from 810 participants were collected manually as well as through online survey registered on www.surveys.google.com, using a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of three sections assessing knowledge, awareness and practice of participants. The descriptive analysis was carried out for demographics and dependent variables with statistical program for social sciences. Spearman test was used to detect any relationship between the health care professional response with respect to their gender and level of education. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: More than half (57.2%) of the health care professionals were working in a hospital setting. Fifty two percent of health care professionals had awareness and 72% were practicing adequate measures to combat COVID-19. The majority (81.9%) believed that the sign and symptoms are similar to a common flu and the main strata of population that could be affected by COVID-19 are elderly (79%). Seventy three percent of participants did not attend any lecture, workshop or seminar on COVID-19 for awareness purpose. Sixty seven percent of health care professionals were practicing universal precaution for infection control and 57.4% were using sodium hypochlorite as a surface disinfectant in dental surgeries. There was no significant relationship (p &gt; 0.05) between the health care professionals’ responses with gender and their education level. Conclusion: The study suggests that the vast majority of the health care professionals have adequate knowledge and awareness related to COVID-19. However some aspects of practice of health care professionals were found to be deficient including, following CDC guidelines during patient care, acquiring verified knowledge related to COVID-19, disinfection protocol and the use of N-95 mask.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown on this population through the lens of users of the UK National Health Service-approved pregnancy and parenting smartphone app, Baby Buddy. The study aims were threefold: to gain insights into the attitudes and experiences of expectant and recent parents (with babies under 24 weeks of age) during the COVID-19 pandemic; to investigate whether Baby Buddy is meeting users' needs during this time; and to identify ways to revise the content of Baby Buddy to better support its users now and in future. METHODS: A mixed methods study design combining a web-based survey with semistructured telephone interviews among Baby Buddy users in the United Kingdom was applied. Data were collected from April 15 to mid-June 2020, corresponding to weeks 4-13 of the lockdown in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: A total of 436 expectant (n=244, 56.0%) and recent (n=192, 44.0%) parents responded to the web-based survey, of which 79.1% (n=345) were aged 25-39 years and 17.2% (n=75) spoke English as their second language. Of the 436 respondents, 88.5% (386/436) reported increased levels of anxiety around pregnancy, birth, and being a new parent, and 58.0% (253/436) were concerned about their emotional and mental health. Of the 244 pregnant respondents, 43.4% (n=106) were concerned about their physical health. Telephone interviews with 13 pregnant women and 19 recent parents revealed similarly increased levels of anxiety due to reduced health care provision and loss of support from friends and family. Although a minority of respondents identified some positive outcomes of lockdown, such as family bonding, many telephone interviewees reported feeling isolated, disregarded, and overwhelmed. Recent parents were particularly anxious about the impact of the lockdown on their baby's development and socialization. Many interviewees were also concerned about their physical health as a consequence of both limited access to face-to-face medical appointments and their own poorer dietary and physical activity behaviors. Across both samples, 97.0% (423/436) of respondents reported that Baby Buddy was currently helping them, with many commenting that its role was even more important given the lack of face-to-face support from health care and parenting organizations. Greater speed in updating digital content to reflect changes due to the pandemic was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened anxiety and stress among expectant parents and those with a young baby, and for many, lockdown has had an adverse impact on their physical and mental well-being. With reductions in health care and social support, expectant and new parents are increasingly relying on web-based resources. As a free, evidence-based app, Baby Buddy is well positioned to meet this need. The app could support its users even more by actively directing them to the wealth of existing content relevant to their concerns and by adding content to give users the knowledge and confidence to meet new challenges.","Rhodes, Alexandra; Kheireddine, Sara; Smith, Andrea D",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,432,16

The broad spectrum immunosuppressant corticosteroid, dexamethasone, is being used to manage the cytokine storm and hyperinflammation in CoVID-19 patients. However, the extensive use of corticosteroids leads to serious adverse events and disruption of the gut-lung axis. Various micronutrients and probiotic supplementations are known to aid in the reduction of hyperinflammation and restoration of gut microbiota.

Involvement of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis by SARS-CoV-2 is currently an actively pursued research area. An increased susceptibility to infection in individuals with DM, HT and CVD together with higher levels of circulating ACE2 in these settings presents a scenario where interaction with soluble ACE2 may result in disseminated virus-receptor complexes that could enhance virus acquisition and pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-ACE2 interaction, both membrane bound and in the cell free context may contribute to elucidating the role of co-morbidities in increased susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis. Both Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown efficacy in mitigating viral carriage in infected individuals. Furthermore, each of these compounds generate active metabolites which in turn may also modulate virus-receptor interaction and thus influence clinical outcomes. In this study, we model the structural interaction of S1 with both full-length and soluble ACE2. Additionally, therapeutic drugs and their active metabolites were docked with soluble ACE2 protein. Our results show that S1 from either of the reported Indian sequences can bind both full-length and soluble ACE2, albeit with varying affinity that can be attributed to a reported substitution in the RBD. Furthermore, both Azythromycin and HCQ together with their active metabolites can allosterically affect, to a range of extents, binding of S1 to ACE2.","Jagtap, Dhanashree; SelvaaKumar, C; Mahale, Smita; Patel, Vainav",,432,10

Using these data and virus characteristics, we developed and evaluated linear and nonlinear models for predicting inactivation rate constants. Multiple linear regressions performed best for predicting the inactivation kinetics of (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses, with cross-validated root mean squared relative prediction errors similar to those associated with experimental rate constants. We tested the models by predicting and measuring inactivation rate constants of a (+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus and a dsDNA marine bacteriophage; the predicted rate constants were within 7% and 71% of the experimental rate constants, respectively, indicating that the prediction was more accurate for the (+) ssRNA virus than the dsDNA virus.

This study examines the adoption of protective behaviors in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak and the influence of religion on risk perception by comparing precautionary behaviors in public and in mosques. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey of 327 Muslim men across the Aceh Province, Indonesia, from April 21, 2020, to May 2, 2020. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t-test were employed to compare the uptake of protective behaviors in public and mosques. RESULTS: The adoption of protective behaviors was higher in public rather than in mosques.

This study examines the adoption of protective behaviors in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak and the influence of religion on risk perception by comparing precautionary behaviors in public and in mosques. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey of 327 Muslim men across the Aceh Province, Indonesia, from April 21, 2020, to May 2, 2020. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t-test were employed to compare the uptake of protective behaviors in public and mosques. RESULTS: The adoption of protective behaviors was higher in public rather than in mosques. It further revealed that the understanding of Islamic teachings during the pandemic has influenced perceived risk and the way Muslim men comply with the protective guidelines.

Varying reports have emerged regarding isolation of viral RNA from these tissue sites, as well as largely autopsy-based histopathologic descriptions of the brain and the eye in patients with CoVID-19. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A primary literature search was performed in literature databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Keywords were used alone and in combination including the following: SARS CoV-2, CoVID-19, eye, brain, central nervous system, histopathology, autopsy, ocular pathology, aqueous, tears, vitreous, neuropathology, encephalitis. RESULTS: The reported ophthalmic pathologic and neuropathologic findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 are varied and inconclusive regarding the role of direct viral infection versus secondary pathology. The authors own experience with autopsy neuropathology in CoVID-19 patients is also described. There is a particular paucity of data regarding the histopathology of the eye. However, it is likely that the ocular surface is a potential site for inoculation and the tears a source of spread of viral particles.

The study of inversions in natural populations is reliant on polytene chromosome analysis by expert cytogeneticists, a process that is limited by the rarity of trained specialists, low throughput, and restrictive sampling requirements. To overcome this barrier, we ascertained tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly correlated with inversion status (inverted or standard orientation). We compared the performance of the tag SNPs using two alternative high throughput molecular genotyping approaches versus traditional cytogenetic karyotyping of the same 960 individual An. gambiae and An. coluzzii mosquitoes sampled from Burkina Faso, West Africa. We show that both molecular approaches yield comparable results, and that either one performs as well or better than cytogenetics in terms of genotyping accuracy. Given the ability of molecular genotyping approaches to be conducted at scale and at relatively low cost without restriction on mosquito sex or developmental stage, molecular genotyping via tag SNPs has the potential to revitalize research into the role of chromosomal inversions in the behavior and ongoing adaptation of An. gambiae and An. coluzzii to environmental heterogeneities.","Love, R Rebecca; Pombi, Marco; Guelbeogo, Moussa W; Campbell, Nathan R; Stephens, Melissa T; Dabire, Roch K; Costantini, Carlo; Torre, Alessandra Della; Besansky, Nora J",G3 (Bethesda Md.),432,26

The Swedish Public Health Agency emphasized individual responsibility and pushed for behavioral changes. With strict lockdown a 77% decrease in ankle fracture incidence has been reported. We investigated whether there was a change in the incidence of ankle fractures seen at 7 selected hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020.Patients and methods - Data on all ankle fractures treated at 7 selected departments during March 15 through June 15, 2020, and for the same period in the preceding 3 years (2017-2019), was retrieved from the Swedish Fracture Register. The number of fractures during the whole period and subsequent 30-day periods were compared between 2020 and 2017-2019, including subgroup analyses of age and sex.Results - The monthly rate of ankle fractures was reduced by 14% in 2020 (139 fractures) compared with 2017-2019 (161 fractures). Women had a 16% decrease and patients aged > 70 years had a 29% decrease. During the 1st 30-day period, a 26% decrease in fractures was seen.Interpretation - During the 1st wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a moderate decline in the number of ankle fractures was seen. Women and patients aged > 70 years displayed the greatest reduction. The greatest reduction in incidence of fractures was seen during the 1st 30-day period. This indicates greater adherence to government recommendations regarding social distancing in these subgroups and during the 1st month of the pandemic. Changes in ankle fracture incidence may be a measure of lockdown extent.","Rydberg, Emilia Möller; Möller, Michael; Ekelund, Jan; Wolf, Olof; Wennergren, David",Acta Orthop,432,14

Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of post-reconstruction Gaussian filtering on the PET images in order to reduce noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio at different low-dose levels. Significant degradation of PET image quality and tumor detectability was observed with a decrease in the injected dose by more than 5%, leading to a remarkable increase in RMSE from 0.173 SUV (at 5%) to 1.454 SUV (at 1%). The quantitative investigation of the malignant lesions demonstrated that SUVmax bias greatly increased in low-dose PET images (in particular at 1%, 2%, 3% levels) before applying the post-reconstruction filter, while applying the Gaussian filter on low-dose PET images led to a significant reduction in SUVmax bias. The SUVmean bias within the malignant lesions was negligible (less than 1%) in low-dose PET images; however, this bias increased significantly after applying the post-reconstruction filter. In conclusion, it is strongly recommended that the SUVmax bias and SUVmean bias in low-dose PET images should be considered prior to and following the application of the post-reconstruction Guassain filter, respectively.","Sanaei, Behnoush; Faghihi, Reza; Arabi, Hossein",,432,16

Size and FDG uptake of the hypermetabolic lymph nodes were measured. Uptake value of spleen was also measured with liver for comparison. RESULTS: All examinees who underwent FDG PET/CT within 14 days' interval showed hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies ipsilateral to vaccine injection. All examinees with hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy had simultaneous muscular uptakes until 23 days' interval. Among 12 examinees who underwent FDG PET/CT more than 15 days after vaccination, only 3 male examinees did not show hypermetabolism in the axillary lymph nodes. There was no female examinee with negative hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy until 29 days after vaccination.

Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of all possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during inference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong correlation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion beats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts poses training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating random sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss, bicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE. Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates more realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods, quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be readily used to generate motion sequences with user-specified motion clips on the timeline.

We find that the disease control experts have a clear tendency and preference to make conservative judgment about the epidemic risk of a low probability and high impact new disease. This conservative preference may have been a major factor in the judging and communicating the risk of COVID-19 epidemic. The experts’ perception of the epidemic risk is affected by their habitual thinking facing a low probability event with uncertain progression. Their conservative preference is augmented by political concerns due to the high social and political impact of the event and the potential political consequence of a false judgment. Balancing personal payoffs of decision options, the experts’ rational choice would lean towards a conservative decision. We propose a three-factor decision model that integrates habitual thinking, political concerns and rational choice to explain the experts’ conservative judgment, and corroborate the model with evidences from the case.

The severity and mortality of COVID-19 are associated with virus-induced dysfunctional inflammatory responses and cytokine storms. However, the interplay between host inflammatory responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural protein of the virion, promotes the virus-triggered activation of NF-&#954;B signaling. After binding to viral RNA, N protein robustly undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which recruits TAK1 and IKK complex, the key kinases of NF-&#954;B signaling, to enhance NF-&#954;B activation. Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol, the inhibitor of LLPS, can attenuate the phase separation of N protein and restrict its regulatory functions in NF-&#954;B activation. These results suggest that LLPS of N protein provides a platform to induce NF-&#954;B hyper-activation, which could be a potential therapeutic target against COVID-19 severe pneumonia.","Wu, Yaoxing; Ma, Ling; Cai, Sihui; Zhuang, Zhen; Zhao, Zhiyao; Jin, Shouheng; Xie, Weihong; Zhou, Lingli; Zhang, Lei; Zhao, Jincun; Cui, Jun",Signal Transduct Target Ther,432,1

We use the situation in Zimbabwe to build an argument that the epidemic is likely to be attenuated in some countries with similar socioeconomic and cultural structures. However, even an attenuated epidemic may overwhelm weak health systems, emphasizing the importance of prevention. These prevention strategies should be tailored to the unique social and cultural networks of individual countries, which may facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is also equally important to maintain services for the major infectious diseases in the region, such as tuberculosis and malaria. A breakdown of treatment and prevention services for these conditions may even overshadow the projected morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Katsidzira, Leolin; Gwaunza, Lenon; Hakim, James G",Clin Infect Dis,432,29

China has experienced an astonishing expansion of its urban scale in the past 40 years, and nearly 783 million of the nation's people now live in cities. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta have been prioritized to become world-class clusters by 2020. The health effects of air pollution in these three urban agglomerations are becoming increasingly formidable. Given these conditions, using the daily mean PM2.5 concentration in 40 cities from January 2014 to December 2016, this research explored the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations in these three urban agglomerations. The annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are 35.39 µg/m3, 53.72 µg/m3 and 78.54 µg/m3, respectively. Compared with the other two urban agglomerations, abundant rainfall causes the Pearl River Delta to have the lowest PM2.5 level. Furthermore, a general regression neural network (GRNN) method is developed to predict the PM2.5 concentration in these clusters on the second day, with inputs including the average, maximum and minimum temperature; average, maximum and minimum atmosphere; total rainfall; average humidity; average and maximum wind speed; and the PM2.5 concentration measured 1 day ahead. The results indicate that the GRNN method can precisely predict the concentration level in these clusters, and it is especially useful for the Pearl River Delta, as the underlying influence mechanism is more specified in this cluster than in the others. Importantly, this 1-day-ahead forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations can raise awareness among the public to improve their precautionary behaviours and help urban planners to provide corresponding support.","Yan, Dan; Kong, Ying; Ye, Bin; Xiang, Haitao",,432,16

Destaca-se que, como cada espécie de réptil apresenta um comportamento metabólico e fisiológico distinto é necessário a realização de estudos com cada espécie em particular. Assim, buscou-se caracterizar os receptores opioides no sistema nervoso central (SNC) e os efeito sedativo e analgésico da morfina e do butorfanol em Iguana iguana. Na 1ª etapa três iguanas jovens (101 ± 6g) e saudáveis foram submetidas à eutanásia para colheita do SNC. Os tecidos de dois animais foram submetidos à técnica do RNAseq para formação de um transcriptoma de novo, para então obter-se as sequências de nucleotídeos dos receptores opioides. Já o tecido de um animal foi submetido à técnica de imuno-histoquímica (IH). Na 2ª etapa, 10 iguanas jovens (160 ± 46g) receberam cinco tratamentos, por via intramuscular e com intervalo de duas semanas entre eles: solução salina (0,3mL, CON), morfina 5 mg/kg (MOR5) e 10 mg/kg (MOR10), butorfanol 5 mg/kg (BUT5) e 10 mg/kg (BUT10). A sedação foi avaliada por meio da escala comportamental específica para iguanas e pelo teste de natação forçada, sendo este por 120 segundos. A latência do reflexo de retirada do membro (LRRM) frente ao estímulo térmico foi utilizada para avaliação antinociceptiva promovida pelos opioides. Todos os testes foram avaliados antes do tratamento (0) e com 30 minutos, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 e 24 horas pós-tratamento. Utilizou-se ANOVA e Dunnett para a comparação com o momento basal (0 minuto) e ANOVA de dois fatores e Tukey entre os grupos. As sequências gênicas compatíveis com os receptores (mu), (kappa) e (delta) foram identificadas, porém o teste de IH não revelou resultados confiáveis para as marcações dos receptores no SNC. Na escala comportamental apesar dos escores de sedação terem sido baixos, foi observado aumento significativo na pontuação entre 30 minutos e 2 horas em MOR5 e entre 30 minutos e 3 horas em MOR10, BUT5 e BUT10. O tempo de natação foi reduzido em MOR10 e BUT5 entre 30 minutos e 2 horas e em BUT10 a redução ocorreu entre 30 minutos e 12 horas. Todos os tratamentos proporcionaram sedação pelos dois testes com 12 horas de avaliação. Por outro lado no teste de termoalgimetria só foi observado aumento no tempo de LRRM em MOR10, entre 2 horas e 4 horas de avaliação. Conclui-se que os receptores opioides estão presentes no SNC, porém apenas e foram evidenciados na IH. Ademais, as duas doses de butorfanol e a maior dose de morfina promovem sedação, sendo que apenas 10 mg/kg de morfina promoveu antinocicepção em iguanas no presente estudo.","BRESSAN, THAIS FERES",,432,14

Dentistry students are at a higher risk of contracting infections, specifically COVID-19, due to direct contact with patients. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, perception and attitude regarding COVID-19 among dentistry students in Austria. Methods: During the first lockdown in Austria, an online survey was distributed among 165 dentistry students in their clinical term at the Medical University of Vienna. The survey contained elaborative questions on the general knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19. A special focus of the questionnaire was set on the modification of the student’s curriculum regarding infection control. Results: In total, 77 (47%) students replied;68 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Dentistry students were found to have good general knowledge of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic. Most students (89.6%) got their information regarding the COVID-19 infection from official sources;however, 58% would like to attend further lectures on COVID-19 to expand their knowledge. Discussion: The current study finds good general knowledge on COVID-19 among dental students, but some gaps regarding hygienic protocols and infection control. Students’ preferences regarding modification in the curriculum suggest practical courses and lectures as a way to close COVID-19 related knowledge gaps.","Boukhobza, S.; Ritschl, V.; Stamm, T.; Bekes, K.",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,432,16

Among the most used surgical procedures are the rectopexies with polypropylene meshes. To compare the biological behavior of two polypropylene, macroporous and monofilament meshes, of different pore size and manufactured with different structural configurations, when fixed on the pre-sacral fascia. Prolene® mesh, a woven mesh with pore size of 164 x 96µ; and T mesh, a non-woven experimental test mesh, with pore size of 4 x 3 mm and pore area 762 times larger than that of Prolene®. Eighteen mongrel dogs, weighing between 8 and 15 kg, were divided in two groups: Prolene® mesh (n=9) and T mesh (n=9). A 4,5 x 2 cm patch of mesh was used to perform the pre-sacral rectopexy by placing nonabsorbable sutures. On the 30th post-operative day, the animals were re-operated and a fragment of the rectal wall including its mesh patch was removed. The macroscopic study evaluated the presence of seroma, hematoma, abscess, fistula, stricture, adhesions and the degree of incorporation of the mesh. The microscopic analysis estimated the inflammatory reaction, foreign body reaction, fibroblastic penetration and the collagen densitometry. One dog of the Prolene® mesh group developed seroma and the mesh was not incorporated. Adhesions were present in all dogs. The other macroscopic parameters were absent in both groups. The microscopic analysis showed lesser inflammatory reaction and higher migration of fibroblasts, attesting the favorable incorporation of the prosthesis. Low foreign body reaction was present, implying satisfactory biological acceptation of the prosthetic material. The densitometry of collagen revealed that the T mesh, with pore area 762 x larger than that of the Prolene® mesh, incorporated a greater amount of total collagen. Whereas the amount of type III or immature collagen was similar in both meshes, the type I or mature collagen was greater in T mesh group. There was no difference between the two groups in macroscopic and histologic studies. Both meshes presented successful incorporation and good biological acceptation. There was a significantly greater incorporation of total collagen and type I (mature) collagen in the T mesh.","Hintz Greca, Fernando; de Lourdes Pessole Biondo-Simões, Maria; Antônio Andrade dos Santos, Eduardo; Wei Kin Chin, Eduardo; Lúcio Stalhschmidt, Fábio; José Brommelstroet Ramos, Eduardo; Martins Collaço, Luiz",Acta cir. bras.,432,16

This property of AEG12 also enables it to inhibit replication of enveloped viruses such as Dengue and Zika viruses at low micromolar concentrations. Weaker inhibition was observed against more distantly related coronaviruses and lentivirus, while no inhibition was observed against the nonenveloped virus adeno-associated virus.

As organizations adhere to those recommendations, they often fail to implement proper privacy requirements to prevent privacy loss of the users of those protocols or systems. This is a very timely issue as health authorities across the world are increasingly putting these regulations in place to mitigate the spread of the current pandemic. A number of solutions have been proposed to mitigate these privacy issues existing in current models of contact tracing or access regulations systems. However, a prevalent pattern among these solutions are they mainly focus on protecting users privacy from server side and involve Bluetooth based ephemeral identifier exchange between users. Another pattern is all the current solutions try to solve the problem in city-wide or nation-wide level. In this paper, we propose a system, PAARS, which approaches the privacy issues in access monitoring/regulation systems from a micro level. We solve the privacy issues in access monitoring/regulation systems without any exchange of any ephemeral identifiers between users. Moreover, our proposed system provides privacy on both server side and the user side by using secure hashing and differential privacy mechanism.","Anjum, Md. Monowar; Mohammed, Noman",,432,4

We show that effective shortest-path distance, unlike conventional geographic distance measures, strongly correlates with node centrality measures. Using the new technique we show that network resilience can be investigated more precisely than with contemporary techniques that are based on percolation theory.

A virtual cardiovascular care program, consisting of patient selection, initial televisit, postconsultation care planning, and follow-up televisits, was developed and delivered by Heartbeat Health, Inc., a cardiovascular digital health company, to 11 SNFs (3510 beds) in New York. The impact of this program on the expected SNF 30-day HF readmission rate is unknown, particularly in the COVID-19 era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess whether a virtual cardiovascular care program could reduce the 30-day hospital readmission rate for patients with HF discharged to SNF relative to the expected rate for this population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case review of SNF patients who received a virtual cardiology consultation between August 2020 and February 2021. Virtual cardiologists conducted 1 or more telemedicine visit via smartphone, tablet, or laptop for cardiac patients identified by a SNF care team. Postconsult care plans were communicated to SNF clinical staff. Patients included in this analysis had a preceding index admission for HF. RESULTS: We observed lower hospital readmission among patients who received 1 or more virtual consultations compared with the expected readmission rate for both cardiac (3% vs 10%, respectively) and all-cause etiologies (18% vs 27%, respectively) in a population of 3510 patients admitted to SNF. A total of 185/3510 patients (5.27%) received virtual cardiovascular care via the Heartbeat Health program, and 40 patients met study inclusion criteria and were analyzed, with 26 (65%) requiring 1 televisit and 14 (35%) requiring more than 1. Cost savings associated with this reduction in readmissions are estimated to be as high as US $860 per patient. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation provides initial evidence for the potential effectiveness and efficiency of virtual and digitally enabled virtual cardiovascular care on 30-day hospital readmissions. Further research is warranted to optimize the use of novel virtual care programs to transform delivery of cardiovascular care to high-risk populations.","Friedman, Daniel M; Goldberg, Jana M; Molinsky, Rebecca L; Hanson, Mark A; Castaño, Adam; Raza, Syed-Samar; Janas, Nodar; Celano, Peter; Kapoor, Karen; Telaraja, Jina; Torres, Maria L; Jain, Nayan; Wessler, Jeffrey D",JMIR Cardio,432,20

Many schizophrenic patients were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. This study took hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 as the research subjects and observed the changes in psychopathology and stress of patients with COVID-19 and the accompanying social isolation. Methods: To sort and isolate potential COVID-19-infected patients, an isolated ward was set up from January 30, 2020, to March 30, 2020. Schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were referred to this ward, and long-term hospitalized cases were included in this study. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Perceived Stress Scale were used to evaluate the severity of mental symptoms and psychological stress in the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, after the diagnosis of COVID-19 and after recovery. At the time of diagnosis, we also extracted the patient's routine blood, biochemical and other indicators and asked the patient's perception of COVID-19. Results: 21 hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study. The changes in PANSS scores were not significant (p = 0.225 baseline vs. diagnosed, p = 0.399 cured vs. diagnosed). The CPSS scores increased significantly after diagnosis and transfer to the isolation ward (p &lt; 0.001 baseline vs. diagnosed, p &lt; 0.001 cured vs. diagnosed). The course of schizophrenia was a protective factor of stress levels to cases (t = -3.25, p = 0.006), and patients' perception of COVID-19 was a risk factor (t = 2.48, p = 0.038). The final multiple linear regression model was statistically significant (F = 8.16, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Hospitalized schizophrenia patients with COVID-19 had increased stress levels and negative symptoms but alleviated positive symptoms after medical isolated treatment. This reminds us that in the face of major epidemics, we must specifically alleviate the psychological burden at the peak of the epidemic and improve the prognosis of patients after the epidemic.","Ma, J.; Jiang, T.; Huang, H.; Li, R.; Zhang, L.; Liu, L.; Liu, X.",Front Psychiatry,432,6

India initiated social distancing measures to combat the epidemic of COVID-19. The course of the epidemic of COVID-19 for India was predicted using stochastic probability–based mathematical modeling. Methods: Data synthesis for the top few countries affected was studied for various factors affecting the epidemic. For projections of infected cases for India, the modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed/recovered framework modified for the effect of social distancing (Rho) was used. Simulation was carried out for 10,000 runs using python. Projections for infected cases and hospitalization requirement were estimated. Results: The epidemic curve will peak in the third week of June in India with 17,525,869 and 2,153,200 infected people with reproduction number of 1.8 and Rho of 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Compared with the baseline scenario of no social distancing, for transmissibility with R0 = 1.8, the reduction in infections due to social distancing measure is 78% (Rho = 0.7) and 97% (Rho = 0.6). Similarly for R0 = 2.2 and 2.4, the reduction in infected numbers slightly lowers to 62% and 66% with Rho = 0.7 and 92% and 75% with Rho = 0.6, respectively. With R0 = 1.8 and Rho = 0.6, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed requirement is 107,660, whereas if transmissibility is high, the ICU bed requirement would increase to 1,994,682. Conclusions: The social distancing measures seem to have been working for India in absence of treatment in sight for COVID-19. Although with the government's response strategy of social distancing, the peak of the epidemic is extended giving more months for preparedness to the country; however, the sustainability of these measures is uncertain.","Patrikar, Seema; Poojary, Deepti; Basannar, D.

We retrospectively reviewed the data of AMI patients admitted to the Nihon University Itabashi Hospital after a COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (COVID-19 period) and the same period from 2017 to 2019 (control period). The patients' characteristics, time course of admission, diagnosis, and treatment of AMI, and 30-day mortality were compared between the two period-groups for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI), respectively. The AMI inpatients decreased by 5.7% after the COVID-19 outbreak. There were no differences among most patient backgrounds between the two-period groups. For NSTEMI, the time from the symptom onset to admission was significantly longer, and that from the AMI diagnosis to the catheter examination tended to be longer during the COVID-19 period than the control period, but not for STEMI. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher during the COVID-19 period for NSTEMI (23.1% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.004), but not for STEMI (9.4% vs. 8.3%, P = 0.77). In conclusion, hospitalizations for AMI decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Acute cardiac care for STEMI and the associated outcome did not change, but NSTEMI outcome worsened after the COVID-19 outbreak, which may have been associated with delayed medical treatment due to the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Arai, Riku; Fukamachi, Daisuke; Ebuchi, Yasunari; Migita, Suguru; Morikawa, Tomoyuki; Monden, Masaki; Takei, Norio; Tamaki, Takehiro; Kojima, Keisuke; Akutsu, Naotaka; Murata, Nobuhiro; Kitano, Daisuke; Okumura, Yasuo",Heart vessels,432,26

In this study, data from Israel's largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. METHODS: All persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics. Study outcomes included documented infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), symptomatic Covid-19, Covid-19-related hospitalization, severe illness, and death. We estimated vaccine effectiveness for each outcome as one minus the risk ratio, using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: Each study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 to 86) and 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 to 80) and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72% (95% CI, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose. Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19-related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial.","Dagan, Noa; Barda, Noam; Kepten, Eldad; Miron, Oren; Perchik, Shay; Katz, Mark A; Hernán, Miguel A; Lipsitch, Marc; Reis, Ben; Balicer, Ran D",N Engl J Med,432,16

It is strongly associated with obesity. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a favorable surgical modality for the treatment of morbid obesity. AIM: Our study evaluated the impact of LSG on patients with NAFLD and morbid obesity, 3 months after the operation, through clinical and biochemical characteristics, clinico-biochemical indices, and imaging parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Morbidly obese patients with NAFLD±NASH underwent LSG. They were thoroughly evaluated clinically (body weight, body mass index, waist circumference) and biochemically (transaminases and triglycerides), as well as through the fatty liver index (FLI), the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), and ultrasound elastography imaging studies (liver stiffness measurement [LSM] and the controlled attenuation parameter [CAP]), before and 3 months after the LSG. RESULTS: Twenty-six obese patients with NAFLD underwent LSG that resulted in a significantly high reduction in all the parameters analyzed, except for liver transaminases. CONCLUSION: LSG is considered an efficient surgical modality for the treatment of morbidly obese patients with NAFLD.","Abdelbary, M S; Marzaban, R; Gamal Eldeen, H; Khairy, M; Menesy, M; Fahmy, M H; Ayad, A M; Mouheb, B S; Yosry, A",Rev. gastroenterol.

Our objectives were to investigate (1) experiences of social isolation and loneliness during shelter-in-place orders, and (2) unmet health needs related to changes in social interactions. DESIGN: Mixed-methods longitudinal phone-based survey administered every 2 weeks. SETTING: Two community sites and an academic geriatrics outpatient clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 151 community-dwelling older adults. MEASUREMENTS: We measured social isolation using a six-item modified Duke Social Support Index, social interaction subscale, that included assessments of video-based and Internet-based socializing. Measures of loneliness included self-reported worsened loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and loneliness severity based on the three-item University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale. Participants were invited to share open-ended comments about their social experiences. RESULTS: Participants were on average aged 75 years (standard deviation = 10), 50% had hearing or vision impairment, 64% lived alone, and 26% had difficulty bathing. Participants reported social isolation in 40% of interviews, 76% reported minimal video-based socializing, and 42% minimal Internet-based socializing. Socially isolated participants reported difficulty finding help with functional needs including bathing (20% vs 55%; P = .04). More than half (54%) of the participants reported worsened loneliness due to COVID-19 that was associated with worsened depression (62% vs 9%; P < .001) and anxiety (57% vs 9%; P < .001). Rates of loneliness improved on average by time since shelter-in-place orders (4-6 weeks: 46% vs 13-15 weeks: 27%; P = .009), however, loneliness persisted or worsened for a subgroup of participants. Open-ended responses revealed challenges faced by the subgroup experiencing persistent loneliness including poor emotional coping and discomfort with new technologies. CONCLUSION: Many older adults are adjusting to COVID-19 restrictions since the start of shelter-in-place orders. Additional steps are critically needed to address the psychological suffering and unmet medical needs of those with persistent loneliness or barriers to technology-based social interaction.","Kotwal, Ashwin A; Holt-Lunstad, Julianne; Newmark, Rebecca L; Cenzer, Irena; Smith, Alexander K; Covinsky, Kenneth E; Escueta, Danielle P; Lee, Jina M; Perissinotto, Carla M",J. am. geriatr. soc,432,24

While numbers of deaths can be used to estimate actual number of infections after a time lag, counties with low death counts early on have considerable uncertainty about true numbers of cases in the future. Here we show that supplementing county-scale mortality statistics with socioeconomic data helps estimate true numbers of COVID-19 infections in low-data counties, and hence provide an early warning of future concern. We fit a LASSO negative binomial regression to select a parsimonious set of five predictive variables from thirty-one county-level covariates. Of these, population density, public transportation use, voting patterns and % African-American population are most predictive of higher COVID-19 death rates. To test the model, we show that counties identified as under-estimating COVID-19 on an early date (April 17) have relatively higher deaths later (July 1) in the pandemic.","Ruck, Damian J; Bentley, R Alexander; Borycz, Joshua",Econ Hum Biol,432,1

When confronted with new pathogens, individuals generate several beliefs about the epidemic phenomenon. Many studies have shown that individual protective behaviors largely depend on these beliefs. Due to the absence of treatment and vaccine against these emerging pathogens, the relation between these beliefs and these behaviors represents a crucial issue for public health policies. In the premises of the Covid-19 pandemic, several preliminary studies have highlighted a delay in the perception of risk by individuals, which potentially holds back the implementing of the necessary precautionary measures: people underestimated the risks associated with the virus, and therefore also the importance of complying with sanitary guidelines. During the peak of the pandemic, the salience of the threat and of the risk of mortality could then have transformed the way people generate their beliefs. This potentially leads to upheavals in the way they understand the world. Here, we propose to explore the evolution of beliefs and behaviors during the Covid-19 crisis, using the theory of predictive coding and the theory of terror management, two influential frameworks in cognitive science and in social psychology.","Bottemanne, H; Morlaàs, O; Schmidt, L; Fossati, P",Encephale,432,32

A year later, our understanding of COVID-19 has advanced, but our process for making ethical decisions surrounding resource allocation has not. During the first wave of the pandemic, our institution uniformly ramped-down clinical activity to accommodate the anticipated demands of COVID-19, resulting in resource waste and inefficiency. In preparation for the second wave, we sought to make such ramp down decisions more prudently and ethically. We report the development of a tool that can be used to make fair and ethical decisions in times of resource scarcity. We formed an interprofessional team to develop and use this tool to ensure that a diverse range of stakeholder perspectives were represented in this development process. This team, called the clinical activity recovery team, established institutional objectives that were combined with well-established procedural values, substantive ethical principles and decision-making criteria by using a variation on the well-known accountability for reasonableness ethical framework. The result of this is a stepwise, semiquantitative, ethical decision tool that can be applied to resource allocation challenges in order to reach fair and ethically defensible decisions. This ethical decision tool can be applied in various contexts and may prove useful at both the institutional and the departmental level; indeed this is how it is applied at our centre.

Through our recent work tracking the well-being of frontline workers in the UK and Ireland (the CV19 Heroes project), we have uncovered additional psychological factors that have not been accounted for in previous models of occupational stress or burnout. In recent months, frontline workers have worked to protect the community from the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and, simultaneously, have evaluated their perceptions of collective efforts of others as either congruent or incongruent with collective goals (e.g., lowered mortality and morbidity): we call this novel aspect solidarity appraisal. These frontline workers have been hailed as heroes, which we argue has led to the creation of an implicit psychological contract (the hero contract) between frontline workers and the public. Here, the heroes are willing to ""go above and beyond"" for the greater good, with the expectation that we (the public) do our part by adhering to public health guidelines. Where frontline workers perceive incongruence between the words and actions of others in working toward collective goals this drives negative affect and subsequent burnout. In this perspective article, we evaluate the cultural context of the pandemic in the UK and Ireland and suggest important socio-cultural factors that contribute to perceptions of solidarity, and how this may relate to burnout and worker welfare during and beyond the pandemic context.","Sumner, R.

As dietas foram compostas por milho, milho/sorgo e sorgo, com e sem suplementação da enzima fitase (1500 UFA/kg-1). Os resultados para conversão alimentar aparente e taxa de crescimento específico foram melhores em dietas suplementadas (P<0,05). A maior taxa de eficiência proteica foi obtida para a dieta milho suplementada (P<0,05). O índice visceros-somático foi menor quando utilizada a dieta milho/sorgo (P<0,05), o índice hepato-somático foi menor nas dietas milho e milho/sorgo independente da suplementação (P<0,05). Os componentes bioquímicos plasmáticos apresentaram variações (P<0,05) mas mantiveram-se dentro os limites para espécie. As variáveis histomorfometricas apresentaram variações nos peixes alimentados com as dietas sorgo e sorgo/milho suplementadas ou não (P<0,05).

Limitations on social gathering have called the wisdom of a conventional trauma meeting into question. We have initiated our virtual trauma meeting and report our early results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Daily morning trauma meetings are now conducted online. Following instigation, we collated the results of a feedback form completed online to assess the relative merits of a virtual trauma meeting. RESULTS: There were 27 responses received to the electronically administered virtual trauma meeting evaluation survey, from a range of trauma and orthopaedic department personnel. There were no concerns regarding patient safety or decision making and, apart from the quality of the audio (63% dissatisfied or very dissatisfied) positive feedback outweighed negative feedback in every category. At 74%, the majority of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied overall with the virtual trauma meeting. CONCLUSION: Trauma meetings can be safely conducted in a virtual environment with high standards of patient care maintained. Virtual trauma meeting offers service enhancements such as early subspecialty input and enhanced cross-site communication and rapid solution development to logistical difficulties. Adapting to conference call etiquette will enhance user experience and opportunity for training opportunities, but adequate investment in high-quality equipment is essential.","Burchette, D; To, C; Willmott, H",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,432,21

Methods: The study had a retrospective longitudinal ecological design, using data from dentistry procedures registered from 99.9% (n = 5,564) of whole 5,570 Brazilian municipalities. The absolute number of endodontic procedures was monthly collected and the rate by 100,000 inhabitants was calculated. To compare the changes in rates during the Pandemic period to the respective period of 2019, the rates of March to August of 2019 and 2020 were calculated. Results: Considering the period of March to August, a reduction rate of endodontic procedures of 50.9% was observed in Brazil, being Maranhão (Northeast Region) the Brazilian state with the highest reduction (93.3%). The reduction rate varied between Brazilian regions. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively in endodontic procedures performed in the Brazilian Public Health System. The postponement of endodontic treatment in Public Health could lead to an overburden of the already stressed system pos-pandemic, increasing the already high number of tooth losses observed in the Brazilian population.","Chisini, L.

However, there is currently no established structure to frame this consultation. METHODS: For suspected referrals with cancer, we adapted the Head and Neck Cancer Risk Calculator (HaNC-RC)-V.2, generated from 10 244 referrals with the following diagnostic efficacy metrics: 85% sensitivity, 98.6% negative predictive value, and area under the curve of 0.89. For follow-up patients, a symptom inventory generated from 5123 follow-up consultations was used. A customized Excel Data Tool was created, trialed across professional groups and made freely available for download at www.entintegrate.co.uk/entuk2wwtt, alongside a user guide, protocol, and registration link for the project. Stakeholder support was obtained from national bodies. RESULTS: No remote consultations were refused by patients. Preliminary data from 511 triaging episodes at 13 centers show that 77.1% of patients were discharged directly or have had their appointments deferred. DISCUSSION: Significant reduction in footfall can be achieved using a structured triaging system.

Capitalizing on nursing students' strengths and supporting areas for remediation will maximize student success. PURPOSE: This study explored undergraduate nursing student strengths and areas for remediation at program entry and across all years of nursing education study. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional design and collected data via the Academic Success Inventory for College Students survey tool. Baseline data were collected on first-year students after program start, and data were collected for all years of study at the end of the academic terms. RESULTS: Compared with other undergraduate students, nursing students exhibited strengths in study skills, in self-organization strategies, in their certainty of progress toward career goals, in recognizing the importance of their studies, and in levels of socializing that did not hinder academic performance. At some data collection points, they had strengths in motivation, confidence, and concentration. Nursing students indicated areas for remediation in studying or test-taking anxiety and their perception of the educator's ability to organize, teach, and assess student progress. CONCLUSION: Nurse educators' pedagogical approaches should augment nursing student strengths. Remediation is required to support student success relative to anxiety, and students need orientation to the process of learning.","Brown, Janine; McDonald, Meghan; Besse, Cheryl; Manson, Patti; McDonald, Reid; Rohatinsky, Noelle; Singh, Madeline",Nurse educ,432,1

Based on numerous evidences indicating that the lipid composition of host membranes is dramatically affected by COVID-19, and in the fact that our endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are sensitive to the membrane composition of pathogenic agents, we propose that such destructive immune response is due to the direct action of AMPs. In a scenario where most host cell membranes are dressed by a pathogenic lipid composition, AMPs can indiscriminately attack them. This is why we use the ""AMP betrayal"" term to describe this mechanism. Previously proposed cytokine/bradykinin storm mechanisms are not incompatible with this new proposal. Interestingly, the harmful action of AMPs could be prevented by new therapies aimed to reestablish the lipid composition or to inhibit the action of specific peptides.","Garcia-Fandino, Rebeca; Piñeiro, Ángel",Front Immunol,432,16

For better prediction of the dynamics of a particular disease, it is important to adopt the most suitable model. In this paper, we study some of the widely-appreciated deterministic epidemic models in which the population is divided into compartments based on the health status of each individual. In particular, we provide a demographic classification of such models and study each of them in terms of mathematical formulation, near equilibrium point stability properties, and disease outbreak threshold conditions (basic reproduction ratio). Furthermore, we discuss the various influential factors that need to be considered during epidemic modeling. The main objective of this article is to provide a basic understanding of the mathematical complexity incurred in deterministic epidemic models with the aid of graphical illustrations obtained through implementation.","Dadlani, Aresh; Afolabi, Richard O.; Jung, Hyoyoung; Sohraby, Khosrow; Kim, Kiseon",,432,1

Recently, we identified GATA4 as the master regulator of LSEC specification during development. Here, we studied endothelial GATA4 in the adult liver and in hepatic disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We generated adult Clec4g-icretg/0xGata4fl/fl (Gata4LSEC-KO) mice with deficiency of Gata4 in LSEC. Livers were analyzed by histology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence, in-situ hybridization, and by expression profiling, ChIP- and ATAC-sequencing of isolated LSEC. For liver regeneration, partial hepatectomy was performed. As models of liver fibrosis, CDAA diet and chronic CCl4 exposure were applied. Human single cell RNAseq data sets were analyzed for endothelial alterations in healthy and cirrhotic livers. RESULTS: Genetic Gata4 deficiency in LSEC of adult mice caused perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, hepatopathy and impaired liver regeneration. Sinusoidal capillarization and LSEC-to-continuous endothelial transdifferentiation were accompanied by a profibrotic angiocrine switch including de novo endothelial expression of hepatic stellate cell-activating cytokine Pdgfb. Increased chromatin accessibility and amplification by activated MYC mediated angiocrine Pdgfb expression. In CDAA diet-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, LSEC showed repression of GATA4, activation of MYC and the profibrotic angiocrine switch already detected in Gata4LSEC-KO mice. Comparison of CDAA-fed Gata4LSEC-KO and control mice demonstrated that endothelial GATA4 indeed protects from dietary-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis. In human cirrhotic livers, GATA4-positive LSEC and endothelial GATA4 target genes were reduced, while non-LSEC endothelial cells and MYC target genes including PDGFB were enriched. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial GATA4 protects from perisinusoidal liver fibrosis by repressing MYC activation and profibrotic angiocrine signaling on the chromatin level. Therapies targeting the GATA4/MYC/PDGFB/PDGFRß axis offer a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of liver fibrosis.","Winkler, Manuel; Staniczek, Theresa; Kürschner, Sina Wietje; Schmid, Christian David; Schönhaber, Hiltrud; Cordero, Julio; Kessler, Linda; Mathes, Arthur; Sticht, Carsten; Neßling, Michelle; Uvarovskii, Alexey; Anders, Simon; Zhang, Xue-Jun; von Figura, Guido; Hartmann, Daniel; Mogler, Carolin; Dobreva, Gergana; Schledzewski, Kai; Géraud, Cyrill; Koch, Philipp-Sebastian; Goerdt, Sergij",J. hepatol,432,19

To determine how these underlying disorders exacerbate pneumonia in COVID-19, we evaluated 79 patients with severe COVID-19 and grouped them according to whether or not they had comorbidities. Clinical information, laboratory examinations, immunological function, and treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Our study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities had higher levels of inflammatory indices, including blood interferon-Î³, interleukin (IL)-6 and c-reactive protein levels as well as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These were accompanied by lymphopenia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, a decrease in either CD4+ T cells or lymphocyte count, and coagulation disorders, which were closely related to poor prognosis. Patients with comorbidities also had longer disease remission times (27 ± 6.7 days) than those without comorbidities (20 ± 6.5 days). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that glucocorticoid therapy and IL-6 were independent prognostic factors. Our findings suggest that coexisting comorbidities aggravate COVID-19 through the excessive release of inflammatory factors and that glucocorticoid therapy may be beneficial.","Han, Dan; Peng, Chunfen; Meng, Rui; Yao, Jing; Zhou, Qiong; Xiao, Yong; Ma, Hong",Aging (Albany NY),432,32

Chest CT is considered an effective tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19. For faster examination, automatic COVID-19 diagnostic techniques using deep learning on CT images have received increasing attention. However, the number and category of existing datasets for COVID-19 diagnosis that can be used for training are limited, and the number of initial COVID-19 samples is much smaller than the normal's, which leads to the problem of class imbalance. It makes the classification algorithms difficult to learn the discriminative boundaries since the data of some classes are rich while others are scarce. Therefore, training robust deep neural networks with imbalanced data is a fundamental challenging but important task in the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we create a challenging clinical dataset (named COVID19-Diag) with category diversity and propose a novel imbalanced data classification method using deep supervised learning with a self-adaptive auxiliary loss (DSN-SAAL) for COVID-19 diagnosis. The loss function considers both the effects of data overlap between CT slices and possible noisy labels in clinical datasets on a multi-scale, deep supervised network framework by integrating the effective number of samples and a weighting regularization item. The learning process jointly and automatically optimizes all parameters over the deep supervised network, making our model generally applicable to a wide range of datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted on COVID19-Diag and three public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets. The results show that our DSN-SAAL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is effective for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in varying degrees of data imbalance.","Hu, Kai; Huang, Yingjie; Huang, Wei; Tan, Hui; Chen, Zhineng; Zhong, Zheng; Li, Xuanya; Zhang, Yuan; Gao, Xieping",,432,5

RESULTS: Results showed a high prevalence of poor sleepers among medical students (72.5%) with poor subjective sleep quality, increased sleep latency, sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction. Multiple regression analysis revealed that family history of suicide attempts, tobacco use, perception of home confinement and reduced physical activity during home confinement significantly contributed to poor sleep quality. Among the psychological variables, anxiety and hopelessness significantly contributed to poor sleep quality in medical students during home confinement. CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed a high prevalence of poor sleep quality in medical students who have been in home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although most triage policies in the USA have seemingly converged on the use of clinical need and benefit as primary criteria for prioritisation, significant differences exist between institutions in how to assign priority to patients with identical medical prognoses: the so-called 'tie-breaker' situations. In particular, one's status as a frontline healthcare worker (HCW) has been a proposed criterion for prioritisation in the event of a tie. This article outlines two major grounds for reconsidering HCW prioritisation. The first recognises trust as an indispensable element of clinical care and mistrust as a hindrance to any public health strategy against the virus, thus raising concerns about the outward appearance of favouritism. The second considers the ways in which proponents of HCW prioritisation deviate from the very 'ethics frameworks' that often preface triage policies and serve to guide resource allocation-a rhetorical strategy that may undermine the very ethical foundations on which triage policies stand. By appealing to trust and consistency, we re-examine existing arguments in favour of HCW prioritisation and provide a more tenable justification for adjudicating on tie-breaker events during crisis standards of care.","Cheung, Alexander T M; Parent, Brendan",J. med. ethics,432,4

Severe complications are observed only in a small proportion of infected patients but the cellular mechanisms underlying this progression are still unknown. Comprehensive flow cytometry of whole blood samples from 54 COVID-19 patients reveals a dramatic increase in the number of immature neutrophils. This increase strongly correlates with disease severity and is associated with elevated IL-6 and IP-10 levels, two key players in the cytokine storm. The most pronounced decrease in cell counts is observed for CD8 T-cells and VD2 Î³Î´ T-cells, which both exhibit increased differentiation and activation. ROC analysis reveals that the count ratio of immature neutrophils to VD2 (or CD8) T-cells predicts pneumonia onset (0.9071) as well as hypoxia onset (0.8908) with high sensitivity and specificity. It would thus be a useful prognostic marker for preventive patient management and improved healthcare resource management.","Carissimo, Guillaume; Xu, Weili; Kwok, Immanuel; Abdad, Mohammad Yazid; Chan, Yi-Hao; Fong, Siew-Wai; Puan, Kia Joo; Lee, Cheryl Yi-Pin; Yeo, Nicholas Kim-Wah; Amrun, Siti Naqiah; Chee, Rhonda Sin-Ling; How, Wilson; Chan, Stephrene; Fan, Bingwen Eugene; Andiappan, Anand Kumar; Lee, Bernett; Rötzschke, Olaf; Young, Barnaby Edward; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David Chien; Renia, Laurent; Ng, Lai Guan; Larbi, Anis; Ng, Lisa Fp",Nat Commun,432,20

These drugs have been used in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated inflammatory sequelae or cytokine storm of infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the population-level interest in anti-rheumatic drugs during the COVID-19 era, by analyzing changes in Google search frequency data. METHOD: To obtain the relative search volume (RSV) of anti-rheumatic drugs, we queried Google Trends for 78 search terms representing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, antigout agents, conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), immunosuppressants, biologics, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors within the USA. Three 8-week periods in 2020 (March 15-May 9), (May 10-July 4), and (July 5-August 29) representing the initial- and short-term periods were compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years (2017-2019). RESULTS: We found statistically significant increases in RSV for colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab (and its brand name-Actemra), and anakinra, and statistically significant decreases among brand names of immunosuppressive agents (i.e., mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) during both the initial- and short-term COVID-19 periods as compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years. CONCLUSION: There were significant increases in RSV of colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and anakinra during both initial- and short-term COVID-19 periods when compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years reflecting a heightened level of information-seeking on these drugs during the pandemic. Rheumatologists should address this increase in informational demand. Further research assessing medium- and long-term interest in anti-rheumatic drugs is required to increase our knowledge on this new pandemic. Key Points â¢This study was aimed to investigate the population-level interest in anti-rheumatic drugs in the COVID-19 era, by analyzing changes in Google search frequency data. â¢Significant increases were seen in relative searches for colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and anakinra during both initial and short-term COVID-19 periods when compared to similar periods of 2017-2019 reflecting a heightened level of information-seeking on these drugs during the pandemic. â¢Rheumatologists should address this increase in informational demand for colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and anakinra.","Kardes, Sinan; Kuzu, Ali Suat; Pakhchanian, Haig; Raiker, Rahul; Karagülle, Mine",Clin. rheumatol,432,7

In comparison with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS, the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is lower but the transmissibility is higher. Immune dysregulation is the most common feature of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 that leads to hyperinflammation. Micronutrients such as zinc are essential for normal immune function. According to the assessment of WHO, approximately one-third of the world's society suffer from zinc deficiency. Low plasma levels of zinc are associated with abnormal immune system functions such as impaired chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and phagocytosis, dysregulated intracellular killing, overexpression of the inflammatory cytokines, lymphopenia, decreased antibody production, and sensitivity to microbes especially viral respiratory infections. Zinc exerts numerous direct and indirect effects against a wide variety of viral species particularly RNA viruses. The use of zinc and a combination of zinc-pyrithione at low concentrations impede SARS-CoV replication in vitro. Accordingly, zinc can inhibit the elongation step of RNA transcription. Furthermore, zinc might improve antiviral immunity by up-regulation of IFN&#945; through JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway in leukocytes. On the other hand, zinc supplementation might ameliorate tissue damage caused by mechanical ventilation in critical COVID-19 patients. Finally, zinc might be used in combination with antiviral medications for the management of COVID-19 patients. In the current review article, we review and discuss the immunobiological roles and antiviral properties as well as the therapeutic application of zinc in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses infections.","Asl, Sima Heydarzadeh; Nikfarjam, Sepideh; Majidi Zolbanin, Naime; Nassiri, Reza; Jafari, Reza",Int Immunopharmacol,432,7

The study base included 37 countries in Europe, South America and Asia. Cluster analysis on the basis of the Euclidean metric for these countries showed the necessity of classifying the USA and China into a separate group, which gave grounds to exclude these countries from the analysis. In addition, Ireland was excluded from the analysis due to its special geographical location. For the remaining countries, the correlation coefficient between the number of airline passengers and the duration of the epidemic before reaching its peak was 0,87, which shows a high level of linear relationship between these indicators. Point forecast for the highest incidence in Russia by regression line falls on the 4th of May. The forecast interval with confidence level?=0.9 is ±14 days from the calculated date. The one-way analysis of variance showed that from April 22 to May 2, there was a slowdown in the growth rates of the diseased, which indicates an exit to the plateau.","Aronov, Iosif Z.; Maksimova, Olga V.; Galkina, Nataliia M.",Int.

Leadership in a crisis involves a range of activities, such as making responsive decisions, communicating those decisions to the public, envisioning goals, generating trust and cooperation, and appealing for collective actions. Effective communication plays an essential role in this process. New Zealand has been regarded as a successful case globally in its crisis response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This study investigates the role of language and discourse in New Zealand's Covid-19 crisis leadership and communication practices. Informed by an interactional sociolinguistics approach, the study draws on frame analysis, positioning theory, and rhetorical analysis to examine how the Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, her leadership team, and New Zealand mainstream media jointly negotiated and co-constructed the leadership discourse. Drawing on a corpus of 98 New Zealand government press briefings, a selected subset of press briefings surrounding significant events at the beginning of the first wave (March 2020) and second wave (August 2020) were coded and analyzed. The study identified a range of discursive strategies employed by Ardern at press briefing speeches and the question and answer sessions. Multiple self-positionings of Ardern and interactive positionings of the virus, the New Zealand government, and New Zealanders were identified. Ardern’s metaphorical framings of the crisis as a ‘fight’ and the response as a collective action provided the basis for rhetorical appeals to the public in the management of the pandemic. A close examination of the ways Ardern responded to media resistance of her discursive framing demonstrated that New Zealand leadership during the pandemic was not only discursively constructed, but also jointly and collaboratively achieved by multiple actors.","Hafner, Christoph A.; Sun, Tongle","Discourse, Context &amp; Media",432,10

Our study addressed the need to correlate serum cardiovascular biomarkers with tissue pathology based on autopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 13 patients, we reviewed the clinical history and measurements of serum troponin and other biomarkers and correlated them with autopsy findings. RESULTS: At autopsy, the 13 COVID-19 patients exhibited evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and cardiomegaly (heart weights ranged from 380 to 1170 grams). Of the 13 patients, three had elevated troponin I and evidence of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (cases 4, 5, and 11), while six had elevated troponin I without evidence of severe CAD (cases 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and four had no clinical or pathological evidence of CAD. Of note, cases 7 and 9 had significantly elevated troponin I levels (8.84 ng/mL and 4.94 ng/mL, respectively). Several cases showed focal degenerative change or damage of cardiomyocytes. However, none of the cases had evidence of lymphocytic myocarditis. CONCLUSION: Although we observed elevated biomarkers of heart failure in some cases, it was not a consistent finding and did not correlate with evidence of myocarditis. The elevated biomarkers may reflect non-ischemic heart damage as a consequence of COVID-19 infection.","Ricks, E.; Wahed, A.; Dasgupta, A.; Buja, L.

Several studies have been performed in order to develop antiviral drugs, from which a few have been prescribed to patients. Also, several diagnostic tests have been designed to accelerate the process of identifying and treating COVID-19. It has been well-documented that the surface of host cells is covered by some receptors, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which mediates the binding and entry of CoV. After entering, the viral RNA interrupts the cell proliferation system to activate self-proliferation. However, having all the information about the outbreakof the SARS-COV-2, it is not still clear which factors determine the severity of lung and heart function impairment induced by COVID-19. A major step in exploring SARS-COV-2 pathogenesis is to determine the distribution of ACE2 in different tissues . In this review, the structure and origin of CoV, the role of ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-COV-2 on the surface of host cells, and the ACE2 distribution in different tissues with a focus on lung and cardiovascular system have been discussed. It was also revealed that acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) may result in the clinical severity of COVID-19.

As cell productivity directly affects the cost of production, methods have been developed to manipulate the expression of specific genes that are known to be involved in protein synthesis, folding, and secretion to increase productivity. However, there have been no large-scale CHO-specific functional screens to identify novel gene targets that impact the production of secreted recombinant proteins. Here, we performed a large-scale, CHO cell-specific small interfering RNA screen to identify genes that consistently enhanced antibody production when silenced in a panel of seven CHO cell lines. Four genes, namely Cyp1a2, Atp5s, Dgki, and P3h2, were identified, and then selected for CRISPR-Cas9 knockout validation in recombinant CHO cell lines. Single knockout of Cyp1a2, Atp5s, or Dgki, but not P3h2, resulted in a more than 90% increase in specific antibody productivity. Overall, the knockout of Cyp1a2 demonstrated the most significant improvement of antibody production, with a minimal impact on cell growth. This article is protected by copyright.

They also have a 15 to 20-fold higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency. Here we summarize evidence that: (i) this health disparity is partly due to insufficient vitamin D production, caused by melanin in the skin blocking the UVB solar radiation necessary for its synthesis; (ii) the vitamin D insufficiency is exacerbated at high latitudes because of the combination of dark skin color with lower UVB radiation levels; and (iii) the health of individuals with dark skin can be markedly improved by correcting deficiency and achieving an optimal vitamin D status, as could be obtained by supplementation and/or fortification. Moderate-to-strong evidence exists that high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and/or vitamin D supplementation reduces risk for many adverse health outcomes including all-cause mortality rate, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, multiple sclerosis, acute respiratory tract infections, COVID-19, asthma exacerbations, rickets, and osteomalacia. We suggest that people with low vitamin D status, which would include most people with dark skin living at high latitudes, along with their health care provider, consider taking vitamin D3 supplements to raise serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) or possibly higher.","Ames, Bruce N; Grant, William B; Willett, Walter C",Nutrients,432,16

Accelerated deforestation, urbanization, and anthropization hastily lead to overpopulation of the bats in urban areas allowing easy interaction with other animals, expansion, and emergence of new zoonotic disease outbreaks potentially harmful to humans. Therefore, getting new insights in the microbiome of bat guano from different places represents an imperative for the future. Furthermore, the use of novel high-throughput sequencing technologies allows better insight in guano microbiome and potentially indicated that some species could be typical guano-dwelling members. Bats are well known as a natural reservoir of many zoonotic viruses such as Ebola, Nipah, Marburg, lyssaviruses, rabies, henipaviruses, and many coronaviruses which caused a high number of outbreaks including ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, many bacterial and fungal pathogens were identified as common guano residents. Thus, the presence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria as environmental reservoirs of extended spectrum ß-lactamases and carbapenemase-producing strains has been confirmed. Bat guano is the most suitable substrate for fungal reproduction and dissemination, including pathogenic yeasts and keratinophilic and dimorphic human pathogenic fungi known as notorious causative agents of severe endemic mycoses like histoplasmosis and fatal cryptococcosis, especially deadly in immunocompromised individuals. This review provides an overview of bat guano microbiota diversity and the significance of autochthonous and pathogenic taxa for humans and the environment, highlighting better understanding in preventing emerging diseases. KEY POINTS: Bat guano as reservoir and source for spreading of autochthonous and pathogenic microbiota Bat guano vs. novel zoonotic disease outbreaks Destruction of bat natural habitats urgently demands increased human awareness.","Dimkic, Ivica; Fira, Djordje; Janakiev, Tamara; Kabic, Jovana; Stupar, Milos; Nenadic, Marija; Unkovic, Nikola; Grbic, Milica Ljaljevic",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,432,16

In the case of housing the state's role has declined sharply since 1989, and the expectation that housing is the private responsibility of each individual and his or her family has strengthened over time as has the homeownership norm. Many measures introduced in the acute phase of the pandemic related in some way to housing and housing quality, such as efforts to ensure social distancing, reduce social contacts, etc. State interventions correspond to the normative assumption that, with some exceptions, the state should not get involved in housing. In this study, we examine the effects of three global crises - the financial crisis, housing affordability, and the pandemic - based on how citizens rank the priorities of the welfare state. Special attention is paid to housing support and how young people differ in evaluation of welfare state priorities. This means people who on the one hand largely make up the net payers in the welfare state and those who have been affected most by the current crisis in housing affordability.

However, graphs do not natively capture the multi-way relationships present among genes and proteins in biological systems. Hypergraphs are generalizations of graphs that naturally model multi-way relationships and have shown promise in modeling systems such as protein complexes and metabolic reactions. In this paper we seek to understand how hypergraphs can more faithfully identify, and potentially predict, important genes based on complex relationships inferred from genomic expression data sets. Results: We compiled a novel data set of transcriptional host response to pathogenic viral infections and formulated relationships between genes as a hypergraph where hyperedges represent significantly perturbed genes, and vertices represent individual biological samples with specific experimental conditions. We find that hypergraph betweenness centrality is a superior method for identification of genes important to viral response when compared with graph centrality. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the utility of using hypergraphs to represent complex biological systems and highlight central important responses in common to a variety of highly pathogenic viruses.","Feng, Song; Heath, Emily; Jefferson, Brett; Joslyn, Cliff; Kvinge, Henry; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Praggastis, Brenda; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Sims, Amy C.; Thackray, Larissa B.; Fan, Shufang; Walters, Kevin B.; Halfmann, Peter J.; Westhoff-Smith, Danielle; Tan, Qing; Menachery, Vineet D.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Cockrell, Adam S.; Kocher, Jacob F.; Stratton, Kelly G.; Heller, Natalie C.; Bramer, Lisa M.; Diamond, Michael S.; Baric, Ralph S.; Waters, Katrina M.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; McDermott, Jason E.; Purvine, Emilie",,432,1

This study aimed to investigate the adoption of protective behaviors by Chinese citizens amid the COVID-19 outbreak and its associated factors. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 22 January to 14 February 2020 through Wenjuanxing platform, measuring their knowledge, risk perception, negative emotion, response to official communication, and protective behaviors in relation to COVID-19. A total of 3008 people completed the questionnaire, of which 2845 were valid questionnaires. RESULTS: On average, 71% of respondents embraced protective behaviors. Those who made no error in the knowledge test (AOR = 1.77, p < 0.001) perceived the high severity of the epidemic (AOR = 1.90, p < 0.001), had high negative emotion (AOR = 1.36, p = 0.005), reported good health (AOR = 1.94, p < 0.001), paid high attention to the governmental media (AOR = 4.16, p < 0.001) and trusted the governmental media (AOR = 1.97, p < 0.001) were more likely to embrace protective behaviors after adjustments for variations in potential confounding factors. Women and older people were also more likely to embrace protective behaviors. No regional or educational differences were found in the adoption of protective behaviors. CONCLUSION: The majority of Chinese citizens embraced protective behaviors. Higher levels of protective behaviors are associated with higher knowledge, perceived severity, negative emotion, and attention to and trust in the official governmental media. Official governmental communication is the largest single predictor of protective behaviors.","Ning, Liangwen; Niu, Jinyu; Bi, Xuejing; Yang, Chao; Liu, Ze; Wu, Qunhong; Ning, Ning; Liang, Libo; Liu, Aishu; Hao, Yanhua; Gao, Lijun; Liu, Chaojie",BMC Public Health,432,21

Under the current standard of care, affected patients are subjected to a lifelong journey of corrective surgeries and multidisciplinary management to replace bone and soft tissues, as well as restore esthetics and physiologic functions while restoring self-esteem and psychological health. Hence, a better understanding of the dynamic interplay of molecular signaling pathways at critical phases of palate development is necessary to pioneer novel prenatal interventions. Such pathways include transforming growth factor-ß (Tgfß), sonic hedgehog (Shh), wingless-integrated site (Wnt)/ß-catenin, bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and its associated receptors, among others. Here, we summarize commonly used surgical methods used to correct cleft defects postnatally. We also review the advances made in prenatal diagnostics of clefts through imaging and genomics and the various in utero surgical corrections that have been attempted thus far. An overview of how key mediators of signaling that drive palatogenesis are emphasized in the context of the framework and rationale for the development and testing of therapeutics in animal model systems and in humans is provided. The pros and cons of in utero therapies that can potentially restore molecular homeostasis needed for the proper growth and fusion of palatal shelves are presented. The theme advanced throughout this review is the need to develop preclinical molecular therapies that could ultimately be translated into human trials that can correct orofacial clefts at earlier stages of development.","Oliver, J D; Turner, E C; Halpern, L R; Jia, S; Schneider, P; D039,; Souza, R N",J Dent Res,432,1

A secondary goal of the present study was to evaluate the performance of the COVID-Q in identifying subjects at higher risk of being tested positive for COVID-19. Material and methodsConsecutive non-hospitalized adults who underwent nasopharyngeal and throat swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection at Treviso Hospital in March 2020, were enrolled. Subjects were divided into positive (cases) and negative (controls) in equal number. All of them gave consent and answered the COVID-Q. Patients not able to answer the COVID-Q due to clinical conditions were excluded. Parallel Analysis and Principal Component Analysis were used to identify clusters of items measuring the same dimension. The Item Response Theory (IRT)-based analyses evaluated the functioning of item categories, the presence of clusters of local dependence among items, item fit within the model and model fit to the data. ResultsAnswers obtained from 230 COVID-19 cases (113 males, and 117 females; mean age 55 years, range 20-99 years) and 230 controls (61 males, and 169 females; mean age 46 years, range 21-89) were analyzed. Parallel analysis led to the extraction of six components, which corresponded to as many clinical presentation patterns: asthenia, influenza-like symptoms, ear and nose symptoms, breathing issues, throat symptoms, and anosmia/ageusia. The final IRT models retained 27 items as significant for symptom assessment. The total score on the questionnaire was significantly associated with positivity to the molecular SARS-CoV-2 test: subjects with multiple symptoms were significantly more likely to be affected by COVID-19 (p < .001). Older age and male gender also represented risk factors. Presence of breathing issues and anosmia/ageusia were significantly related to positivity to SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001). None of the examined comorbidities had a significant association with COVID-19 diagnosis. ConclusionAccording to the analyses, COVID-Q could be validated since the aspects it evaluated were overall significantly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The application of the novel COVID-Q to everyday clinical practice may help identifying subjects who are likely to be affected by COVID-19 and address them to a nasopharyngeal swab in order to achieve an early diagnosis.

Cases originating from Brazil have been reported in France, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, Argentina, and Chile. The epidemic began in the Central-West region of Brazil in 2014, spreading into the Southern region, with significant non-human primate transmission continuing towards Paraguay and Argentina. METHODS: This report is an integrative review of Pan American Health Organization cooperation during a sylvatic yellow fever epidemic. RESULTS: The Pan American Health Organization has played a central role in handling the yellow fever emergency, collaborating with the Ministry of Health and various research groups in supporting interventions of different response areas. The Pan American Health Organization's technical cooperation included: training and workshops to exchange experiences, carrying out technical cooperation in patient management and epidemiological, entomological, laboratory, and epizootic surveillance, organizing the assistance network, and acquiring strategic inputs. The Pan American Health Organization's technical cooperation supported the Ministry of Health's decision to adopt a single-dose vaccine and use fractional doses to support the vaccination needs of more than 39,000,000 people. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic contributed to the failure of reaching the yellow fever vaccination goals and made it difficult to integrate the yellow fever vaccine into recommended areas. CONCLUSIONS: Given the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, it is necessary to strengthen measures for the surveillance, prevention, and control of yellow fever with multilateral cooperation between countries.","Melo, Carlos Frederico Campelo de Albuquerque E; Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando da Costa; Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Júnior; Araujo, Wildo Navegantes de",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,432,1

Social distancing measures were introduced in the UK in March 2020 and virtual consultations (via telephone or video call) were identified as a potential alternative to face-to-face consultations at this time. LOCAL PROBLEM: The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) sees on average 11 200 face-to-face consultations a month. On average 7% of these are delivered virtually via telephone. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the RNOH set a target of reducing face-to-face consultations to 20% of all outpatient attendances. This report outlines a quality improvement initiative to rapidly implement virtual consultations at the RNOH. METHODS: The COVID-19 Action Team, a multidisciplinary group of healthcare professionals, was assembled to support the implementation of virtual clinics. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement approach to quality improvement was followed using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. A process of enablement, process redesign, delivery support and evaluation were carried out, underpinned by Improvement principles. RESULTS: Following the target of 80% virtual consultations being set, 87% of consultations were delivered virtually during the first 6 weeks. Satisfaction scores were high for virtual consultations (90/100 for patients and 78/100 for clinicians); however, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, video consultations would be preferred less than 50% of the time. Information to support the future redesign of outpatient services was collected. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that virtual consultations can be rapidly implemented in response to COVID-19 and that they are largely acceptable. Further initiatives are required to support clinically appropriate and acceptable virtual consultations beyond COVID-19. REGISTRATION: This project was submitted to the RNOH's Project Evaluation Panel and was classified as a service evaluation on 12 March 2020 (ref: SE20.09).","Gilbert, Anthony William; Billany, Joe C T; Adam, Ruth; Martin, Luke; Tobin, Rebecca; Bagdai, Shiv; Galvin, Noreen; Farr, Ian; Allain, Adam; Davies, Lucy; Bateson, John",,432,1

However, apart from studies of Chinese origin, few reports are available on COVID-19 severity among the Asian population. This study investigates potential risk factors for development of critical COVID-19 in an Iranian population. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all adults with COVID-19 from 2 tertiary centers in Iran who had been diagnosed between February 20 and April 1, 2020, in either inpatient or outpatient settings. “Critical COVID-19” was proposed when a hospitalized patient was scheduled for admission to intensive care unit, assisted by mechanical ventilation, or pronounced dead. We used univariable and multivariable logistic and linear regression models to explore the potential risk factors associated with critical COVID-19, admission to hospital, and length of hospital stay. Results: Of the 590 recruited patients, 427 (72.4%) were hospitalized, 186 (31.5%) had critical COVID-19, and 107 (18.2%) died. In the multivariable regression analysis, age &gt;60 years and physical/mental disabilities were associated with critical COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR), 2.33 and 7.03;95% CI, 1.51-3.60 and 2.88-17.13, respectively);and history of renal, heart, or liver failure was associated with both COVID-19 hospitalization (OR, 4.13;95% CI 1.91-8.95;p&lt;0.001) and length of hospital stay (Beta 1.90;95% CI, 0.763.04;p=0.001). Conclusion: Age &gt;60 years and physical/mental disabilities can predict development of critical COVID-19 in the Iranian population. Also, the presence of renal, heart, or liver failure might predict both COVID-19 hospitalization and length of hospital stay. © 2021 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

However, a question remains whether vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949 people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date. While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group ([~]169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll, 44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.","Massey, Daisy; Berrent, Diana; Krumholz, Harlan",,432,21

Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (&#8805;10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 versus <50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR = 1.73, [95% CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. For the other three factors, meta-regression analyses suggested confounding by age. Only four studies reported multivariable analysis, but most of them showed adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the potential for confounding, these results suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are independently associated with severe COVID-19 and, together with age and male sex, can be informative for predicting the risk of severe COVID-19.","Matsushita, Kunihiro; Ding, Ning; Kou, Minghao; Hu, Xiao; Chen, Mengkun; Gao, Yumin; Honda, Yasuyuki; Zhao, Di; Dowdy, David; Mok, Yejin; Ishigami, Junichi; Appel, Lawrence J",Glob Heart,432,5

They are often used interchangeably, but we pose the provocative question as to whether they should be. We review the literature to evaluate for any differences in efficacy between the two classes in order to determine if the greater side effects associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are offset by any advantageous effects on outcomes to warrant their use over angiotensin receptor blockers. RECENT FINDINGS: In many clinical scenarios, the data supports similar efficacy between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, while in a minority of others, there are murky signals from previous trials that suggest ACE inhibitors may be better. However, when reviewing the literature in its entirety, and taking into account recently published pooled analysis and head to head trials, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have similar efficacy. This is in contrast to data on adverse effects, which consistently favors the use of ARBs. From the available data, it is reasonable to conclude that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have equal efficacy yet unequal adverse effects. It is in this context that we take the provocative stance that ACE inhibitors should not be used to treat hypertension.","Turner, Jeffrey M; Kodali, Ravi",Curr Cardiol Rep,432,2

METHODS: Phone interviews were conducted with 103 mild COVID-19 patients in Israel, over a six-month period (April 2020 to October 2020). Patients were recruited via social media and word to mouth and were interviewed up to 4 times, depending on their unresolved symptoms reports. Inclusion criteria required participants to be Israeli residents aged &#8805;18 years, with positive COVID-19 RT-PCR results and non-severe symptoms. Symptoms' onset, duration, severity, and resolution were analyzed. RESULTS: 44% (45/103), 41% (42/103), 39% (40/103) or 38% (39/103) of the patients experienced headache, fever, muscle ache, or dry cough as the first symptom respectively. Smell and taste changes were experienced 3.9 ± 5.4 and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean ± SD) after disease onset, respectively. Among prevalent symptoms, fever had the shortest duration (5.8 ± 8.6 days), and taste and smell changes were the longest-lasting symptoms (17.2 ± 17.6 and 18.9 ± 19.7 days, durations censored at 60 days). Longer recovery of the sense of smell correlated with the extent of smell change. At the six-month follow-up, 46% (47/103) of the patients had at least one unresolved symptom, most commonly fatigue (22%, 23/103), smell and taste changes (15%, 15/103 and 8%, 8/103 respectively), and breathing difficulties (8%, 8/103).

Strict lockdowns have not been enforced, potentially affecting viral dissemination. To understand the levels of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n = 5,100) were sampled at random between 14 March 2020 and 28 February 2021. METHODS: In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n = 2,600) and pregnant women (n = 2,500) were sampled for consecutive weeks (at four intervals) throughout the study period. Sera from all participants and a cohort of historical (negative) controls (n = 595) were screened for IgG responses against stabilized trimers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the smaller receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard analytical approaches, a probabilistic (cut-off independent) Bayesian framework that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyse data over time. SETTING: Healthy participant samples were randomly selected from their respective pools through Karolinska University Hospital. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority: registration number 2020-01807. PARTICIPANTS: No participants were symptomatic at sampling, and blood donors were all over the age of 18. No additional metadata were available from the participants. RESULTS: Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 13 December 2020. By the end of February 2021, 19% of the population tested seropositive. Notably, 96% of seropositive healthy donors screened (n = 56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titres comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the first year since the start of community transmission, seropositivity levels in metropolitan in Stockholm had reached approximately one in five persons, providing important baseline seroprevalence information prior to the start of vaccination.","Castro Dopico, X; Muschiol, S; Christian, M; Hanke, L; Sheward, D J; Grinberg, N F; Rorbach, J; Bogdanovic, G; Mcinerney, G M; Allander, T; Wallace, C; Murrell, B; Albert, J; Karlsson Hedestam, G B",J. intern. med,432,24

Many physicians across the globe are changing practice patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine the practice changes among rheumatologists and what they perceive the impact to be on their most vulnerable patients. METHODS: We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists worldwide during the initial height of the pandemic (between 8 April and 4 May 2020) via social media and group emails. We surveyed rheumatologists about their opinions regarding patients from low SES and racial/ethnic minority groups in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, what their specific concerns were, including the challenges of medication access; and about specific social factors (health literacy, poverty, food insecurity, access to telehealth video) that may be complicating the management of rheumatologic conditions during this time. RESULTS: 548 rheumatologists responded from 64 countries and shared concerns of food insecurity, low health literacy, poverty and factors that preclude social distancing such as working and dense housing conditions among their patients. Although 82% of rheumatologists had switched to telehealth video, 17% of respondents estimated that about a quarter of their patients did not have access to telehealth video, especially those from below the poverty line. The majority of respondents believed these vulnerable patients, from racial/ethnic minorities and from low SES groups, would do worse, in terms of morbidity and mortality, during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: In this sample of rheumatologists from 64 countries, there is a clear shift in practice to telehealth video consultations and widespread concern for socially and economically vulnerable patients with rheumatic disease.","Mehta, Bella; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Fontana, Mark Alan; Moezinia, Carine J; Mancuso, Carol A; Bass, Anne R; Antao, Vinicius C; Gibofsky, Allan; Goodman, Susan M; Ibrahim, Said",,432,16

The primary focus has been on reducing the viral spread and treating respiratory symptoms; as time goes on, the impact of COVID-19 on neurological and haemostatic systems becomes more evident. The clinical data suggest that platelet hyperactivity plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 from its onset and that platelets may serve critical functions during COVID-19 progression. Hyperactivation of blood platelets and the coagulation system are emerging as important drivers of inflammation and may be linked to the severity of the 'cytokine storm' induced in severe cases of COVID-19, in which disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet hyperactivity are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality. We propose that targeting platelet hyperactivity in the early stages of COVID-19 infection may reduce the immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19 and subdue the systemic inflammatory response. Lowering baseline platelet activity may be of particular importance for higher-risk groups. As an alternative to antiplatelet drugs, an inappropriate intervention in public health, we propose that the dietary antiplatelet agent Fruitflow®, derived from tomatoes, may be considered a suitable therapy. Fruitflow® contains antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory compounds that target the mechanisms of platelet activation specific to COVID-19 and can be considered a safe and natural antiplatelet regime.","O039,; Kennedy, Niamh; Duttaroy, Asim K",Med Hypotheses,432,24

METHODS: This prospective, cohort study collected and resulted SARS-CoV-2 IgG serum samples as positive or negative from June 8 to July 10, 2020 from a convenience sample of 16,233 adult participants employed by a large Midwestern healthcare system. Documented positive polymerase chain reaction test results representing COVID-19 infections were recorded up to four months prior to and post-IgG testing. RESULTS: Nine hundred and thirteen (6.12%) participants, including 45 (4.93%) IgG positive participants, experienced COVID-19 infections after study initiation, representing a 51% increased risk of COVID-19 infection among IgG positive participants (IRR = 1.51). Regressions adjusted for documented disparities showed no difference in COVID-19 infection by IgG status (OR=1.19; P = .3117) but significantly greater odds in COVID-19 recurrence among participants with a prior documented COVID-19 infection (OR=1.93; P < .0001).

We aimed to characterize recent COVID-19-related community practice noninvasive diagnostic imaging professional work declines. METHODS: Using imaging metadata from nine community radiology practices across the United States between January 2019 and May 2020, we mapped work relative value unit (wRVU)-weighted stand-alone noninvasive diagnostic imaging service codes to both modality and body region. Weekly 2020 versus 2019 wRVU changes were analyzed by modality, body region, and site of service. Practice share &#967;2 testing was performed. RESULTS: Aggregate weekly wRVUs ranged from a high of 120,450 (February 2020) to a low of 55,188 (April 2020). During that -52% wRVU nadir, outpatient declines were greatest (-66%). All practices followed similar aggregate trends in the distribution of wRVUs between each 2020 versus 2019 week (P = .96-.98). As a percentage of total all-practice wRVUs, declines in CT (20,046 of 63,992; 31%) and radiography and fluoroscopy (19,196; 30%) were greatest. By body region, declines in abdomen and pelvis (16,203; 25%) and breast (12,032; 19%) imaging were greatest. Mammography (-17%) and abdominal and pelvic CT (-14%) accounted for the largest shares of total all-practice wRVU reductions. Across modality-region groups, declines were far greatest for mammography (-92%). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial COVID-19-related diagnostic imaging work declines were similar across community practices and disproportionately impacted mammography. Decline patterns could facilitate pandemic second wave planning. Overall implications for practice workflows, practice finances, patient access, and payment policy are manifold.","Duszak, Richard; Maze, Jeff; Sessa, Candice; Fleishon, Howard B; Golding, Lauren P; Nicola, Gregory N; Hughes, Danny R",J Am Coll Radiol,432,16

We designed a novel acrylic box (endoscopy box (EBOX)) with the intention of limiting aerosol and droplet spread during such procedures. We evaluated clinical utility, impact on the endoscopy team and also assessed the impact of the EBOX on macroscopic droplet spread from a simulated cough during UGIE. Methods: Clinical utility was evaluated prospectively via EBOX use on 15 patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (13) or endoscopic ultrasound (2). Feedback was recorded from the endoscopy team regarding ease of positioning, impact of the EBOX on procedural performance and cleaning. A cough was simulated via explosion of a hyperinflated balloon containing 0.75 mL of ultraviolet disclosing lotion within the oral cavity of a mannequin, with and without the EBOX. Macroscopic spread was then evaluated with a ultraviolet torch. Results: Three endoscopists and the team members found that the EBOX did not hamper the procedure and felt it was a useful adjunct to full personal protective equipment (PPE). Simulated cough without the EBOX identified macroscopic spread up to 2.3 m away from the patient's mouth as well as onto key areas such as the exposed neck of the endoscopist, which is not considered in current PPE guidance. Simulated cough using the EBOX significantly reduced macroscopic spread onto key areas of the healthcare workers. Conclusions: The EBOX is a valuable adjunct to recommended PPE for UGIE, but still allows these procedures to be performed in the standard manner.","McLeod, Robert William John; Warren, Neil; Roberts, Stuart Ashley",Frontline Gastroenterol.,432,16

Apps accessible through the internet and on mobile devices create an opportunity to enhance our traditional indicator-based surveillance systems, which have high specificity but issues with timeliness. Objective: The aim of this study is to describe the literature on web-based apps for indicator-based surveillance and response to acute communicable disease outbreaks in the community with regard to their design, implementation, and evaluation. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the published literature across four databases (MEDLINE via OVID, Web of Science Core Collection, ProQuest Science, and Google Scholar) for peer-reviewed journal papers from January 1998 to October 2019 using a keyword search. Papers with the full text available were extracted for review, and exclusion criteria were applied to identify eligible papers. Results: Of the 6649 retrieved papers, 23 remained, describing 15 web-based apps. Apps were primarily designed to improve the early detection of disease outbreaks, targeted government settings, and comprised either complex algorithmic or statistical outbreak detection mechanisms or both. We identified a need for these apps to have more features to support secure information exchange and outbreak response actions, with a focus on outbreak verification processes and staff and resources to support app operations. Evaluation studies (6 out of 15 apps) were mostly cross-sectional, with some evidence of reduction in time to notification of outbreak;however, studies lacked user-based needs assessments and evaluation of implementation. Conclusions: Public health officials designing new or improving existing disease outbreak web-based apps should ensure that outbreak detection is automatic and signals are verified by users, the app is easy to use, and staff and resources are available to support the operations of the app and conduct rigorous and holistic evaluations.","Quinn, Emma Hsiao Kai Hsun Maitland-Scott Isis Gomez Maria Baysari Melissa T.; Najjar, Zeina Gupta Leena",JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,432,0

The classification proposed that type A aortic dissection should be surgically repaired immediately, whereas type B aortic dissection can be treated medically. Since then, diagnostic tools and management of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) have undergone substantial evolution. This paper evaluated historical changes of ATAAD repair at Stanford University since the establishment of the aortic dissection classification 50 years ago. The surgical approaches to the proximal and distal extent of the aorta, cerebral perfusion methods, and cannulation strategies were reviewed. Additional analyses using patients who underwent ATAAD repair at Stanford University from 1967 through December 2019 were performed to further illustrate the Stanford experience in the management of ATAAD. While technical complexity increased over time, post-operative survival continued to improve. Further investigation is warranted to delineate factors associated with the improved outcomes observed in this study.","Zhu, Yuanjia; Lingala, Bharathi; Baiocchi, Michael; Tao, Jacqueline J; Toro Arana, Veronica; Khoo, Jason W; Williams, Kiah M; Traboulsi, Abd Al-Rahman; Hammond, Hilary C; Lee, Anson M; Hiesinger, William; Boyd, Jack; Oyer, Philip E; Stinson, Edward B; Reitz, Bruce A; Mitchell, R Scott; Miller, D Craig; Fischbein, Michael P; Woo, Y Joseph",J Am Coll Cardiol,432,2

We aimed to examine risk factors for COVID-19 death. METHODS: A total of 80 543 COVID-19 cases reported in China, nationwide, through April 8, 2020 were included. Risk factors for death were investigated by Cox proportional hazards regression and stratified analyses. RESULTS: Overall national case fatality ratio (CFR) was 5.64%. Risk factors for death were older age (&#8805;80: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=12.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]=6.78-23.33), presence of underlying disease (aHR=1.33, CI=1.19-1.49), worse case severity (severe: aHR=3.86, CI=3.15-4.73; critical: aHR=11.34, CI=9.22-13.95), and near-epicenter region (Hubei: aHR=2.64, CI=2.11-3.30; Wuhan: aHR=6.35, CI=5.04-8.00). CFR increased from 0.35% (30-39 years) to 18.21% (&#8805;70 years) without underlying disease. Regardless of age, CFR increased from 2.50% for no underlying disease to 7.72% for 1, 13.99% for 2, and 21.99% for &#8805;3. CFR increased with worse case severity from 2.80% (mild), to 12.51% (severe) and 48.60% (critical) regardless of region. Compared to other regions, CFR was much higher in Wuhan regardless of case severity (mild: 3.83% versus 0.14% in Hubei and 0.03% elsewhere; moderate: 4.60% versus 0.21% and 0.06%; severe: 15.92% versus 5.84% and 1.86%; and critical: 58.57% versus 49.80% and 18.39%). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients regardless of underlying disease and patients with underlying disease regardless of age were at elevated risk of death. Higher death rates near the outbreak epicenter and during the surge of cases reflect the deleterious effects of allowing health systems to become overwhelmed.","Zhang, Yanping; Luo, Wei; Li, Qun; Wang, Xijie; Chen, Jin; Song, Qinfeng; Tu, Hong; Ren, Ruiqi; Li, Chao; Li, Dan; Zhao, Jing; McGoogan, Jennifer M; Shan, Duo; Li, Bing; Zhang, Jingxue; Dong, Yanhui; Jin, Yu; Mao, Shuai; Qian, Menbao; Lv, Chao; Zhu, Huihui; Wang, Limin; Xiao, Lin; Xu, Juan; Yin, Dapeng; Zhou, Lei; Li, Zhongjie; Shi, Guoqing; Dong, Xiaoping; Guan, Xuhua; Gao, George F; Wu, Zunyou; Feng, Zijian",Clin. infect. dis,432,8

As with the financial slump of 2008, however, such notions have proved almost ridiculously optimistic as it has been capital, through its near symbiosis with the state, that has been best able to respond, with the English government-the devolved nations adopted a markedly different approach-taking every opportunity to ensure the pandemic has proved a bonanza for private-sector healthcare interests. However, this has not just been about individual contracts in, for example, test and trace, vaccination, or personal protective equipment; the crisis has been used to both rescue the private acute market following 2 years of contracted revenues and to provide enormous stimulus for its future growth. This has required the support of several organizations acting in concert, including the NHS Confederation and the Royal Colleges. While the pandemic has served to illuminate such relationships, the author also argues that the oft-recurring governmental praise of the NHS needs to be matched by genuine investment in public hospitals.","Player, Stewart D",Int J Health Serv,432,5

Because these patients require follow-up in the outpatient setting, family physicians should be prepared to provide ongoing care and screening for post-ICU complications. Risk factors for complications after ICU discharge include previous ICU admissions, preexisting mental illness, greater number of comorbidities, and prolonged mechanical ventilation or higher opioid exposure while in the ICU. Early nutritional support and mobilization in the ICU decrease the risk of complications. After ICU discharge, patients should be screened for depression, anxiety, insomnia, and cognitive impairment using standardized screening tools. Physicians should also inquire about weakness, fatigue, neuropathy, and functional impairment and perform a targeted physical examination and laboratory evaluation as indicated;treatment depends on the underlying cause. Exercise regimens are beneficial for reducing several post-ICU complications.

Here we discuss the intervention of introducing technology that aims to trace and alert contacts of infected persons-contact tracing (CT) technology. Determining whether such an intervention is proportional is complicated by complex trade-offs and feedback loops. We suggest that the resulting uncertainties necessitate a precautionary approach. On the one hand, precautionary reasons support CT technology as a means to contribute to the prevention of harms caused by alternative interventions, or COVID-19 itself. On the other hand, however, both the extent to which such technology itself present risks of serious harm, as well as its effectiveness, remain unclear. We therefore argue that a precautionary approach should put reversibility of CT technology at the forefront.

Since 2108, we began to take microlectures to students teaching. Microlectures are online presentations, and the microlecture teaching method has many advantages, such as a short teaching time, situational resource composition, diverse communication, strong pertinence and can attend microlectures from home. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the advantages of the microlecture teaching method on students in standardized residency training. METHODS: Students from our department were randomly divided into the traditional teaching group (control group) and the microlecture teaching group (observation group). The teaching duration for both groups was 3 months. All students were assessed on basic knowledge of the neurology before enrollment. After the teaching session, the students were assessed on teaching effect, theoretical operation, and clinical practice satisfaction. The students also evaluated the teachers, and the teachers evaluated the students. RESULTS: A total of 84 students participated in the study and were divided equally into the observation group (42 students) and the control group (42 students). The results showed that the rate of reaching the standard of teaching effect, achievement of theory and operation, satisfaction with clinical practice, the student's grades by teachers, and student satisfaction with teachers were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The microlecture teaching method can effectively improve the clinical teaching effect for neurology students and should be adopted in clinical teaching, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kong, Zhaohong; Li, Tao; Zhang, Zhaohui; Jiang, Jian; Mei, Junhua",Ann Palliat Med,432,15

One hundred and thirty-eight samples from 95 COVID-19 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were analyzed to assess the clinical sensitivity. Seventy-six pre-COVID-19 samples were used to evaluate the clinical specificity. Two independent and blinded raters determined visually the presence or absence of the IgG, IgM, and control lines for each test after 10 and 20 min. The sensitivity obtained from collected samples more than 14 days after the onset of symptoms was 95.2% for IgG. IgM was less frequently detected (highest sensitivity of 20.5%). The specificities obtained were 98.7% and 100% for IgG and IgM, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity of the assay was better when the reading was performed at 20 min than at 10 min, whereas the specificity was unchanged. The Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test detects IgG with high sensitivity 14 days since symptom onset but presents a low sensitivity for IgM.

Only 21 studies out of 6433 reviewed met the inclusion criteria, with most studies exploring the effects of Ebola. While few studies were identified on harmful practices, a more robust evidence base was identified in regards to adolescent pregnancy, with studies pointing to its increase due to the epidemic or infection control measures, including school closures. The evidence base for studies exploring the impact on violence outcomes was limited, with sexual violence and exploitation located in a few studies on Ebola. Important lessons from this exercise can be applied to the COVID-19 response, particularly the inclusion of the most vulnerable children in programming, policy and further research.","Chavez Villegas, C.; Peirolo, S.; Rocca, M.; Ipince, A.; Bakrania, S.",International Journal of Educational Development,432,20

This is particularly relevant for the onset or exacerbation of pathological contamination fears in people with vulnerability to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or in those individuals with sub-threshold obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or who achieved recovery after a successful treatment. Strict movement restrictions and hygiene habits are essential to limit Covid-19 diffusion and delay its progression. However, the occurrence of dysfunctional, clinically relevant contamination fears may be the downside highlighting the importance of a more comprehensive knowledge on the vulnerability factors of OCD in order to inform policy making and risk communication on one hand, early identification and prevention on the other one. The importance of early identification and prevention of OCD during critical periods, such as the present one, is of paramount importance since this psychiatric condition is associated with a prolonged latency in the correct diagnosis and first professional contact which is in turn associated with worse prognosis and higher resistance to treatment.","Pozza, Andrea; Mucci, Federico; Marazziti, Donatella",Clin.

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. AIMS: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS. SOURCES: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. CONTENT: COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2.0-2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7-1.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation. IMPLICATIONS: There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat.","Petrosillo, N; Viceconte, G; Ergonul, O; Ippolito, G; Petersen, E",Clin Microbiol Infect,432,0

Although this trend helps students continue learning without in-person classes, it removes a vital tool that teachers use to teach effectively: visual cues. By not being able to see a student's face clearly, the teacher may not notice when the student needs assistance, or when the student is not paying attention. In order to help remedy the teachers of this challenge, this project proposes a machine learning based approach that provides real-time student mental state monitoring and classifications for the teachers to better conduct remote teaching. Using publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) data collections, this research explored four different classification techniques: the classic deep neural network, the traditionally popular support vector machine, the latest convolutional neural network, and the XGBoost model, which has gained popularity recently. This study defined three mental classes: an engaged learning mode, a confused learning mode, and a relaxed mode. The experimental results from this project showed that these selected classifiers have varying potentials in classifying EEG signals for mental states. While some of the selected classifiers only yield around 50% accuracy with some delay, the best ones can achieve 80% accurate classification in real-time. This could be very beneficial for teachers in need of help making remote teaching adjustments, and for many other potential applications where in-person interactions are not possible.","Liu, Daben Kyle",,432,26

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This is the first international survey assessing the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the training of doctors of all grades and specialties. METHODS: An online global survey was disseminated using Survey Monkey® between 4th August 2020 and 17th November 2020. A global network of collaborators facilitated participant recruitment. Data were collated anonymously with informed consent and analysed using univariate and adjusted multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-three doctors of median age 27 (IQR: 25-30) were included with the majority (56.8%, n = 422) being male. Two-thirds of doctors were in a training post (66.5%, n = 494), 52.9% (n = 393) in a surgical specialty and 53.0% (n = 394) in low- and middle-income countries. Sixty-nine point two percent (n = 514) reported an overall perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their training. A significant decline was noted amongst non-virtual teaching methods such as face-to-face lectures, tutorials, ward-based teaching, theatre sessions, conferences, simulation sessions and morbidity and mortality meetings (P &#8804; .05). Low or middle-income country doctors' training was associated with perceived inadequate supervision while performing invasive procedures under general, local or regional anaesthetic. (P &#8804; .05). CONCLUSION: In addition to the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare infrastructure, this international survey reports a widespread perceived overall negative impact on medical and surgical doctors' training globally. Ongoing adaptation and innovation will be required to enhance the approach to doctors' training and learning in order to ultimately improve patient care.","Laloo, Ryan; Santhosh Karri, Rama; Wanigasooriya, Kasun; Beedham, William; Darr, Adnan; Layton, Georgia R; Logan, Peter; Tan, Yanyu; Mittapalli, Devender; Patel, Tapan; Mishra, Vivaswan Dutt; Odeh, Osama Faleh; Prakash, Swathi; Elnoamany, Salma; Peddinti, Sri Ramya; Daketsey, Elorm Adzoa; Gadgil, Shardool; Bouhuwaish, Ahmad; Ozair, Ahmad; Bansal, Sanchit; Elhadi, Muhammed; Godbole, Aditya Amit; Axiaq, Ariana; Rauf, Faateh Ahmad; Ashpak, Ashna",Int J Clin Pract,432,31

BSAGM who returned to the family home during the lockdown reported fear of involuntary disclosure of their sexual identity, exposure to stigma in relation to their sexuality, and anxiety about their relationships with significant others. In order to cope with the resultant threats to identity, some individuals concealed their sexual identity, which could undermine their sense of identity authenticity, and some reported engaging in casual sexual encounters as a means of coping with identity threat. BSAGM may be at high risk of identity threat during the COVID-19 outbreak with limited access to social and psychological support in relation to their sexuality. This in turn may lead to a reliance on ineffective coping strategies, such as sexual risk-taking.","Jaspal, Rusi",Sex Cult,432,12

An Outcome Study,17.590004,8.189524,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has exposed healthcare workers to extreme physical workloads and psychological challenges. Thus, we aimed to assess the immediate correlates of emotional stress and to identify which specific jobs, departments, and exposure types are risk factors for emotional stress in healthcare workers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study conducted from April 2 to 10, 2020, university hospital workers were administered self-reported questionnaires that covered general characteristics and included the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and a visual analog scale. At-risk groups for depression and anxiety were identified, and the odds ratios for depression and anxiety were analyzed after adjusting for age, gender, education, marital status, and duration of employment. RESULTS: The data of 1,003 participants were analyzed. Of these, 14.2% worked in wards for confirmed COVID-19 cases and 15.2% had had direct contact with these patients. Treating patients with COVID-19 was associated with depression and anxiety, while dealing with COVID-19 test samples was associated with depression. Exposure to random or unspecified patients was also associated with depression. Lastly, social rejection and other negative experiences were associated with depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak is correlated with healthcare workers' emotional stress, and specific types of jobs and duties involving close contact with these patients can be risk factors. Interestingly, even low-exposure groups reported significant depression and anxiety as a result of social stigma and uncertainty. Adequate and timely management measures for emotional stress are required for vulnerable and at-risk groups.","Park, Chulyong; Hwang, Jong Moon; Jo, Seongmin; Bae, Seong Jin; Sakong, Joon",J Korean Med Sci,432,19

This review analyzes and addresses gaps in modeling supply chain resilience in general and specifically for vaccines in order to guide researchers and practitioners alike to improve critical function of vaccine supply chains in the face of inevitable disruptions. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic review of the literature on modeling supply chain resilience from 2007 to 2020 is analyzed in tandem with the vaccine supply chain manufacturing literature. These trends are then used to apply a novel matrix analysis to seven Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annual filings of pharmaceutical corporations involved in COVID-19 vaccine manufacture and distribution. Findings: Pharmaceutical corporations favor efficiency as they navigate regulatory, economic and other threats to their vaccine supply chains, neglecting resilience – absorption, adaptation and recovery from inevitable and unexpected disruptions. However, explicitly applying resilience analytics to the vaccine supply chain and further leveraging emerging network science tools found in the academic literature, such as artificial intelligence (AI), stress tests and digital twins, will help supply chain managers to better quantify efficiency/resilience tradeoffs across all associated networks/domains and support optimal system performance post disruption. Originality/value: This is the first review addressing resilience analytics in vaccine supply chains and subsequent extension to operational management through novel matrix analyses of SEC Filings. The authors provide analyses and recommendations that facilitate resilience quantification capabilities for vaccine supply chain managers, regulatory agencies and corporate stakeholders and are especially relevant for pandemic response, including application to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Golan, M.

OBJECTIVE: To compare overall rates, demographics, types of abuse and acuity of child abuse and neglect encounters seen at one university health system for the 6 months before and after school closings due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data was extracted from a database of billed ICD10 codes for child abuse and neglect including sexual abuse codes. There were 579 encounters for patients <18 years of age and 476 unique patients. METHODS: In addition to ICD10 code and pre/post school closing, each encounter was identified to be inpatient, outpatient and/or emergency department. Demographic data such as age, gender, ethnicity, and race were extracted. Incident rate ratios in addition to descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sample t-test, or the chi-square test of association were used in the analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were identified for total rates of child abuse and neglect encounters (p = .08), physical abuse (p = .91) nor child maltreatment (p = .86) codes or in the age (p = .46), gender (p = .58), and race/ethnicity (p = .15) of patient encounters pre- versus post-school closings. The sexual abuse incidence and inpatient encounters increased by 85% (IRR = 1.85, p < .0001; IRR = 1.85, p = .004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a unique contribution to the existing literature in that we identified a significant increase in the incidence of sexual abuse and higher patient acuity as evidenced by higher rates of inpatient encounters after school closing due to SARS-Cov-2.","Salt, Elizabeth; Wiggins, Amanda T; Cooper, Gena L; Benner, Kalea; Adkins, Brian W; Hazelbaker, Katherine; Rayens, Mary Kay",Child Abuse Negl,432,20

Queensland has only had 1,067 cases as of June 30, 2020, of which 78% have been overseas acquired. Australia and Queensland acted early to address COVID-19 by putting in place a range of strategies including travel bans (international and domestic), isolation measures, testing regimes, advice to business, economic support, and research funding. Agriculture was designated an essential business and as such has continued operating throughout the pandemic. They have however had to develop and implement COVID plans to keep workers safe. To help agricultural business establish plans information was developed by Safe Work Australia, National Farmers Federation and the Queensland Department of Workplace Health and Safety. Workforce issues were identified early, particularly seasonal workers (those who travel from their usual place of residence to another place to work). The Queensland Government enacted a directive about how seasonal workers were to be managed and also developed a guide specifically for horticulture to help manage their COVID-19 response. We provide two case studies demonstrating how agriculture has responded to COVID-19. Agriculture has successfully, in Queensland, adapted quickly to the changing work conditions due to COVID-19. This is due to all levels of government coming together with industry to find solutions. Some changes have had wider benefits such as improved sanitation, better communication and a greater recognition of seasonal worker needs.

Mexico is the country with the fourth highest fatality rate from SARS-Cov-2, with high mortality in younger adults. OBJECTIVES: To describe and characterize the association of NCDs with the case-fatality rate (CFR) adjusted by age and sex in Mexican adults with a positive diagnosis for SARS-Cov-2. METHODS: We studied Mexican adults aged &#8805;20 years who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 during the period from 28 February to 31 July 2020. The CFR was calculated and associations with history of NCDs (number of diseases and combinations), severity indicators and type of institution that treated the patient were explored. The relative risk (RR) of death was estimated using Poisson models and CFR was adjusted using logistic models. RESULTS: We analysed 406 966 SARS-Cov-2-positive adults. The CFR was 11.2% (13.7% in men and 8.4% in women). The CFR was positively associated with age and number of NCDs (p trend <0.001). The number of NCDs increased the risk of death in younger adults when they presented three or more NCDs compared with those who did not have any NCDs [RR, 46.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 28.2, 76.9 for women; RR, 16.5; 95% CI, 9.9, 27.3 for men]. Lastly, there was great heterogeneity in the CFR by institution, from 4.6% in private institutions to 18.9% in public institutions. CONCLUSION: In younger adults, higher CFRs were associated with the total number of NCDs and some combinations of type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease.","Monterrubio-Flores, Eric; Ramírez-Villalobos, María D; Espinosa-Montero, Juan; Hernandez, Bernardo; Barquera, Simón; Villalobos-Daniel, Victor E; Campos-Nonato, Ismael",Int. j. epidemiol,432,18

The general morphology of the columella shows considerable variation across species, yet few studies have attempted to provide quantitative comparisons, and basic anatomical data has not been thoroughly reported. In this study, we examined the middle ear in 49 taxonomically diverse species of bird. We found significant correlations between measurements of several features (columellar length, mass, tympanic membrane area, footplate area) and interaural diameter. While scaling of columellar length with interaural diameter is consistent with isometry, masses and areas showed negative allometry, or a non-proportional scaling with interaural diameter. These observations remained true even for species with unusual middle ear morphology, such as Alcedinidae (Kingfishers) in which the basal struts of the columella form a structure almost resembling a mammalian stapes, or Tytonidae (Barn Owls) which have a highly bulbous footplate.

Our study identified risk factors for in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19 infection at a tertiary care center, in Detroit, Michigan. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study at a 776-bed tertiary care urban academic medical center. Adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 (nasopharyngeal swab testing positive by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay) from March 8, 2020, to June 14, 2020, were included. Clinical information including the presence of comorbid conditions (according to the Charlson Weighted Index of Comorbidity (CWIC)), initial vital signs, admission laboratory markers and management data were collected. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 565 hospitalized patients, 172 patients died for a case fatality rate of 30.4%. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 64.4 (16.2) years, and 294 (52.0%) were male. The patients who died were significantly older (mean [SD] age, 70.4 [14.1] years vs 61.7 [16.1] years; P < 0.0001), more likely to have congestive heart failure (35 [20.3%] vs 47 [12.0%]; P = 0.009), dementia (47 [27.3%] vs 48 [12.2%]; P < 0.0001), hemiplegia (18 [10.5%] vs 18 [4.8%]; P = 0.01) and a diagnosis of malignancy (16 [9.3%] vs 18 [4.6%]; P = 0.03).From multivariable analysis, factors associated with an increased odds of death were age greater than 60 years (OR = 2.2, P = 0.003), CWIC score (OR = 1.1, P = 0.023), qSOFA (OR = 1.7, P < 0.0001), WBC counts (OR = 1.1, P = 0.002), lymphocytopenia (OR = 2.0, P = 0.003), thrombocytopenia (OR = 1.9, P = 0.019), albumin (OR = 0.6, P = 0.014), and AST levels (OR = 2.0, P = 0.004) on admission. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified risk factor for in-hospital mortality among patients admitted with COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital at the onset of U.S. Covid-19 pandemic. After adjusting for age, CWIC score, and laboratory data, qSOFA remained an independent predictor of mortality.

Their immunosuppressive effect might be valuable in patients with COVID-19 characterised by substantial immune system dysfunction by controlling inflammation and promoting disease tolerance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of IL-6 blocking agents compared to standard care alone or with placebo on efficacy and safety outcomes in COVID-19. We will update this assessment regularly. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to 11 February 2021) and the L-OVE platform, and Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register to identify trials up to 26 February 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IL-6 blocking agents compared with standard care alone or with placebo for people with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. The protocol was amended to reduce the number of outcomes considered. Two review authors independently collected data and assessed the risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence with the GRADE approach for the critical outcomes such as clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement on the scale used by trialists to evaluate clinical progression or recovery) (day (D) 28 / &#8805; D60); WHO Clinical Progression Score of level 7 or above (i.e. the proportion of participants with mechanical ventilation +/- additional organ support OR death) (D28 / &#8805; D60); all-cause mortality (D28 / &#8805; D60); incidence of any adverse events; and incidence of serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 10 RCTs with available data including one platform trial comparing tocilizumab and sarilumab with standard of care. These trials evaluated tocilizumab (nine RCTs including two platform trials; seven were reported as peer-reviewed articles, two as preprints; 6428 randomised participants); and two sarilumab (one platform trial reported as peer reviewed article, one reported as preprint, 880 randomised participants). All trials included were multicentre trials. They were conducted in Brazil, China, France, Italy, UK, USA, and four were multi-country trials. The mean age range of participants ranged from 56 to 65 years; 4572 (66.3%) of trial participants were male. Disease severity ranged from mild to critical disease. The reported proportion of participants on oxygen at baseline but not intubated varied from 56% to 100% where reported. Five trials reported the inclusion of intubated patients at baseline. We identified a further 20 registered RCTs of tocilizumab compared to placebo/standard care (five completed without available results, five terminated without available results, eight ongoing, two not recruiting); 11 RCTs of sarilumab (two completed without results, three terminated without available results, six ongoing); six RCTs of clazakisumab (five ongoing, one not recruiting); two RCTs of olokizumab (one completed, one not recruiting); one of siltuximab (ongoing) and one RCT of levilimab (completed without available results). Of note, three were cancelled (2 tocilizumab, 1 clazakisumab). One multiple-arm RCT evaluated both tocilizumab and sarilumab compared to standard of care, one three-arm RCT evaluated tocilizumab and siltuximab compared to standard of care and consequently they appear in each respective comparison. Tocilizumab versus standard care alone or with placebo a. Effectiveness of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 Tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome of clinical improvement at D28 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13; I2 = 40.9%; 7 RCTs, 5585 participants; absolute effect: 31 more with clinical improvement per 1000 (from 0 fewer to 67 more); moderate-certainty evidence). However, we cannot exclude that some subgroups of patients could benefit from the treatment. We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (&#8805; D60). The effect of tocilizumab on the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score of level of 7 or above is uncertain at D28 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.74; I2 = 64.4%; 3 RCTs, 712 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not obtain data for longer-term follow-up (&#8805; D60). Tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97; I2 = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 6363 participants; absolute effect: 32 fewer deaths per 1000 (from 52 fewer to 9 fewer); high-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests uncertainty around the effect on mortality at &#8805; D60 (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.40; I2 = 0.0%; 2 RCTs, 519 participants; low-certainty evidence). b. Safety of tocilizumab for patients with COVID-19 The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tocilizumab on adverse events (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.72; I2 = 86.4%; 7 RCTs, 1534 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.06; I2 = 0.0%; 8 RCTs, 2312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Sarilumab versus standard care alone or with placebo The evidence is uncertain about the effect of sarilumab on all-cause mortality at D28 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty), on all-cause mortality at &#8805; D60 (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.0; 1 RCT, 420 participants; low certainty), and serious adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77; 2 RCTs, 880 participants; low certainty). It is unlikely that sarilumab results in an important increase of adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25; 1 RCT, 420 participants; moderate certainty). However, an increase cannot be excluded No data were available for other critical outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: On average, tocilizumab reduces all-cause mortality at D28 compared to standard care alone or placebo and probably results in slightly fewer serious adverse events than standard care alone or placebo. Nevertheless, tocilizumab probably results in little or no increase in the outcome clinical improvement (defined as hospital discharge or improvement measured by trialist-defined scales) at D28. The impact of tocilizumab on other outcomes is uncertain or very uncertain. With the data available, we were not able to explore heterogeneity. Individual patient data meta-analyses are needed to be able to identify which patients are more likely to benefit from this treatment. Evidence for an effect of sarilumab is uncertain and evidence for other anti-IL6 agents is unavailable. Thirty-nine RCTs of IL-6 blocking agents with no results are currently registered, of which nine are completed and seven trials were terminated with no results available. The findings of this review will be updated as new data are made available on the COVID-NMA platform (covid-nma.com).","Ghosn, Lina; Chaimani, Anna; Evrenoglou, Theodoros; Davidson, Mauricia; Graña, Carolina; Schmucker, Christine; Bollig, Claudia; Henschke, Nicholas; Sguassero, Yanina; Nejstgaard, Camilla Hansen; Menon, Sonia; Nguyen, Thu Van; Ferrand, Gabriel; Kapp, Philipp; Riveros, Carolina; Ávila, Camila; Devane, Declan; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Rada, Gabriel; Hróbjartsson, Asbjørn; Grasselli, Giacomo; Tovey, David; Ravaud, Philippe; Boutron, Isabelle",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,432,16

STUDY DESIGN: Newham University Hospital based in East London serving a population with the highest death rate secondary to SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, commenced universal screening of all admissions to the Maternity Unit from 22nd April to 5th May, 2020. A proforma was created to capture key patient demographics, indication for admission and presence of SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms at the point of presentation. RESULTS: A total of 180 women with a mean age of 29.9 (SD 7.4) years, at a median gestation of 39 (IQR 37â¯+â¯1-40â¯+â¯3) weeks underwent universal screening with nasopharyngeal PCR swabs during the two-week period of the study. BAME identity or parity was not associated with the likelihood of a positive result. Seven women (3.9 %, 1.6-7.8) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 6 (3.3 %, 1.2-7.1) were asymptomatic; 85.7 % (42.1-99.6) of the SARS-CoV-2 positive women were asymptomatic. The sensitivity of symptom-driven testing was 14.3 % (0.36-57.87) and specificity was 91.86 % (86.72-95.48) with a positive predictive value of 6.67 % (1.08-31.95) and a negative predictive value of 96.34 % (95.10-97.28). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the maternity population served by Newham University Hospital was 3.9 %, four weeks after lockdown. Of the women who were found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, a high proportion (87.9 %) were asymptomatic. These findings support the need for universal testing to enable targeted isolation and robust infectious control measures to mitigate outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in maternity units.","Abeysuriya, Sanduni; Wasif, Samreen; Counihan, Callum; Shah, Neha; Iliodromiti, Stamatina; Cutino-Moguel, Maria-Teresa; Saeed, Ferha; Velauthar, Luxmimalar",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,432,20

It also warrants for the search of immunomodulatory drugs that could improve disease outcome. Here, we show that standard doses of ivermectin (IVM), an anti-parasitic drug with potential immunomodulatory activities through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, prevent clinical deterioration, reduce olfactory deficit, and limit the inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. Whereas it has no effect on viral load in the airways of infected animals, transcriptomic analyses of infected lungs reveal that IVM dampens type I interferon responses and modulates several other inflammatory pathways. In particular, IVM dramatically reduces the Il-6/Il-10 ratio in lung tissue and promotes macrophage M2 polarization, which might account for the more favorable clinical presentation of IVM-treated animals. Altogether, this study supports the use of immunomodulatory drugs such as IVM, to improve the clinical condition of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.","de Melo, Guilherme Dias; Lazarini, Françoise; Larrous, Florence; Feige, Lena; Kornobis, Etienne; Levallois, Sylvain; Marchio, Agnès; Kergoat, Lauriane; Hardy, David; Cokelaer, Thomas; Pineau, Pascal; Lecuit, Marc; Lledo, Pierre-Marie; Changeux, Jean-Pierre; Bourhy, Hervé",EMBO Mol Med,432,1

At the time of this study, the number of daily new cases in the United States was greater than that in any other country, and the trend was increasing in most states. Google Trends provides data regarding public interest in various topics during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods may provide useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to consider the predictive ability of different search terms not directly related to COVID-19 with regard to the increase of daily cases in the United States. In particular, we are concerned with searches related to dine-in restaurants and bars. Data were obtained from the Google Trends application programming interface and the COVID-19 Tracking Project. METHODS: To test the causation of one time series on another, we used the Granger causality test. We considered the causation of two different search query trends related to dine-in restaurants and bars on daily positive cases in the US states and territories with the 10 highest and 10 lowest numbers of daily new cases of COVID-19. In addition, we used Pearson correlations to measure the linear relationships between different trends. RESULTS: Our results showed that for states and territories with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries related to bars and restaurants, which mainly occurred after reopening, significantly affected the number of daily new cases on average. California, for example, showed the most searches for restaurants on June 7, 2020; this affected the number of new cases within two weeks after the peak, with a P value of .004 for the Granger causality test. CONCLUSIONS: Although a limited number of search queries were considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant effect on daily new cases in US states and territories with higher numbers of daily new cases. We showed that these influential search trends can be used to provide additional information for prediction tasks regarding new cases in each region. These predictions can help health care leaders manage and control the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on society and prepare for its outcomes.","Asgari Mehrabadi, Milad; Dutt, Nikil; Rahmani, Amir M",JMIR Public Health Surveill,432,16

On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On February 28, WHO increased our assessment of the risk of spread and the risk of impact of COVID-19 to very high at a global level. The COVID-19 poses significant threats to international health.Computed tomography (CT) has been an important imaging modality in assisting in the diagnosis and management of patients withCOVID-19. Some retrospective imaging studies have reported chest CT findings of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, suggesting that several CT findings may be characteristic. To our knowledge, there has been no prospective multicentre imaging study of COVID-19 to date.We proposed a hypothesis: There are some specific CT features on Chest CT of COVID-19 patients. And the mechanism of these CT features is explicable based on pathological findings. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specific CT features of COVID-19 and the formation mechanism of these CT features. METHOD: This study is a prospective multicenter observational study. We will recruit 100 patients with COVID-19 at 55 hospitals. All patients undergo chest CT examination with the same scan protocol. The distribution and morphology of lesions on chest CT, clinical data will be recorded. A number of patients will be pathologically examined after permission is granted.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Mid-regional proAdrenomedullin (MR-proADM) as a marker of SARS CoV2-related widespread endothelial damage, clinically identified by organs damage, disease severity and mortality. Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection has been prospectively enrolled and demographic characteristic, clinical and laboratory data has been evaluated. In the overall population, 58% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 23.3% of patients died, 6.5% acute cardiac injury, 1.4% of patients developed acute ischemic stroke, 21.2% acute kidney injury, 11.8% acute liver damage, and 5.4% septic shock. The best MR-proADM cut-off values for ARDS development and mortality prediction were 3.04 nmol/L and 2 nmol/L, respectively. Patients presenting with MR-proADM values &#8805; 2 nmol/L showed a significantly higher mortality risk. In conclusion, MR-proADM values &#8805; 2 nmol/l identify those patients with high mortality risk related to a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.

METHODS: Using county-level data and multilevel negative binomial models, we evaluate associations between COVID-19 cases and percentages of residents that are foreign-born, Latinx, Black, or Asian, presenting estimates for all counties combined and stratifying across regions. Given varying risk factors among Latinx, we also evaluate associations for percentages of residents from specific Latin American-origin groups. RESULTS: Percentage of foreign-born residents is positively associated with COVID-19 case rate (IRR = 1.106; 95% CI: 1.074-1.139). Adjusted associations for percentage Latinx are nonsignificant for all counties combined, but this obscures heterogeneity. Counties with more Central Americans have higher case rates (IRR = 1.130; 95% CI: 1.067-1.197). And, in the Northeast and Midwest, counties with more Puerto Ricans have higher case rates. Associations with percentage Asians are nonsignificant after adjusting for percentage foreign-born. With the confirmation of prior evidence, the percentage of Black residents is positively and robustly associated with COVID-19 case rate (IRR = 1.031; 95% CI: 1.025-1.036). CONCLUSIONS: Counties with more immigrants, as well as more Central American or Black residents, have more COVID-19 cases.

However, there is limited literature on the appropriate timing of corticosteroid administration to obtain the best possible patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including patients with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid treatment from March 2 to June 30, 2020 in seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. We analyzed the patient demographics, characteristics, and clinical outcomes according to the timing of steroid use. Twenty-two patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled, and they were all treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients who received corticosteroids, 12 patients (55%) were treated within 10 days from diagnosis. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics. The initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 168.75. The overall case fatality rate was 25%. The mean time from diagnosis to steroid use was 4.08 days and the treatment duration was 14 days in the early use group, while those in the late use group were 12.80 days and 18.50 days, respectively. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio, C-reactive protein level, and cycle threshold value improved over time in both groups. In the early use group, the time from onset of symptoms to discharge (32.4 days vs. 60.0 days, P = 0.030), time from diagnosis to discharge (27.8 days vs. 57.4 days, P = 0.024), and hospital stay (26.0 days vs. 53.9 days, P = 0.033) were shortened. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with severe COVID-19, early use of corticosteroids showed favorable clinical outcomes which were related to a reduction in the length of hospital stay.","Hyun, Jong Hoon; Kim, Moo Hyun; Sohn, Yujin; Cho, Yunsuk; Baek, Yae Jee; Kim, Jung Ho; Ahn, Jin Young; Choi, Jun Yong; Yeom, Joon Sup; Ahn, Mi Young; Kim, Eun Jin; Baek, Ji-Hyeon; Kim, Young Keun; Choi, Heun; Jeong, Su Jin",BMC Infect Dis,432,16

Patients undergoing TAVI between January 2012 and November 2017 in the Nationwide Readmission Database were identified. Trends in cause-specific readmissions were assessed using Poisson regression. Thirty-day TAVI cost burden (cost of index TAVI hospitalization plus total 30-day readmissions cost) was adjusted to 2017 U.S. dollars and trended over year from 2012 to 2017. Overall, 47,255 TAVI were included and 30-day readmissions declined from 20% to 12% (p<0.0001). Most common causes of readmission (heart failure, infection/sepsis, gastrointestinal causes, and respiratory) declined as well, except arrhythmia/heart block which increased (1.0% to 1.4%, p<0.0001). Cost of TAVI hospitalization ($52,024 to $44,110, p<0.0001) and 30-day cost burden ($54,122 to $45,252, p<0.0001) declined. While costs of an average readmission did not change ($9,734 to $10,068, p=0.06), cost burden of readmissions (per every TAVI performed) declined ($4,061 to $1,883, p<0.0001), including reductions in each of the top 5 causes except arrhythmia/heart block ($171 to $263, p=0.04). Index TAVI hospitalizations complicated by acute kidney injury, length of stay &#8805;5 days, low hospital procedural volume, and skilled nursing facility discharge were associated with increased odds of 30-day readmissions. In conclusion, the costs of index hospitalizations and 30-day cost burden for TAVI in the U.S. significantly declined from 2012-2017. However, readmissions due to arrhythmia/heart block and their associated costs increased. Continued strategies to prevent readmissions, especially those for conduction disturbances, are crucial in the efforts to optimize outcomes and costs with the ongoing expansion of TAVI.","Arora, Sameer; Hendrickson, Michael J; Strassle, Paula D; Qamar, Arman; Pandey, Ambarish; Kolte, Dhaval; Sitammagari, Kranthi; Cavender, Matthew A; Fonarow, Gregg C; Bhatt, Deepak L; Vavalle, John P",,432,16

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Population-based study including subjects resident in the province of Milan and Lodi. PARTICIPANTS: 127 735 residents older than 70 years, with specific chronic conditions. INTERVENTIONS: We developed a predictive algorithm for overall mortality risk based on demographic and clinical characteristics. All residents older than 70 years were classified as being at low or high risk of death from COVID-19 infection according to the algorithm. The high-risk group was assigned to their GPs for telephone triage and consultation. The high-risk cohort was divided into two groups based on GP intervention: patients who were not contacted and patients who were contacted by their GPs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall mortality, COVID-19 morbidity and hospitalisation. RESULTS: Patients with increased risk of death from COVID-19 were 127 735; 495 669 patients were not at high risk and were not included in the intervention. Out of the high-risk subjects, 79 110 were included but not contacted by their GPs, while 48 625 high-risk subjects were included and contacted. Overall mortality, morbidity and hospitalisation was higher in high-risk patients compared with low-risk populations. High-risk patients contacted by their GPs had a 50% risk reduction in COVID-19 mortality, and a 70% risk reduction in morbidity and hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with non-contacted patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that, during the COVID-19 outbreak, involvement of GPs and changes in care management of high-risk groups produced a significant reduction in all adverse health outcomes.","Russo, Antonio Giampiero; Faccini, Marino; Bergamaschi, Walter; Riussi, Antonio",BMJ Open,432,16

Among the latter, pulsed light may be an effective, non-chemical decontamination alternative. Pulsed light technology inactivates microorganisms and viruses by using high intensity polychromatic light pulses, which degrades nucleic acids and proteins. This review describes this technology, compiles and critically analyzes the evidence about the virucidal efficacy of pulsed light technology with view on its potential use against SARS-CoV-2 in touching surfaces in health-care facilities. The efficacy of pulsed light proved against many different kind of viruses allows to conclude that is a suitable candidate to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 as long as the required fluence is applied and the appropriated exposure to contaminated surfaces is guaranteed.","Jean, Julie; Rodríguez-López, María Isabel; Jubinville, Eric; Núñez-Delicado, Estrella; Gómez-López, Vicente M",J Photochem Photobiol B,432,26

However, there is concern that their predictions may have been misleading. Here, we dissect the predictions made by four models for the daily COVID-19 death counts between March 25 and June 5 in New York state, as well as the predictions of ICU bed utilisation made by the influential IHME model. We evaluated the accuracy of the point estimates and the accuracy of the uncertainty estimates of the model predictions. First, we compared the ""ground truth"" data sources on daily deaths against which these models were trained. Three different data sources were used by these models, and these had substantial differences in recorded daily death counts. Two additional data sources that we examined also provided different death counts per day. For accuracy of prediction, all models fared very poorly. Only 10.2% of the predictions fell within 10% of their training ground truth, irrespective of distance into the future. For accurate assessment of uncertainty, only one model matched relatively well the nominal 95% coverage, but that model did not start predictions until April 16, thus had no impact on early, major decisions. For ICU bed utilisation, the IHME model was highly inaccurate; the point estimates only started to match ground truth after the pandemic wave had started to wane. We conclude that trustworthy models require trustworthy input data to be trained upon. Moreover, models need to be subjected to prespecified real time performance tests, before their results are provided to policy makers and public health officials.","Chin, Vincent; Samia, Noelle I; Marchant, Roman; Rosen, Ori; Ioannidis, John P A; Tanner, Martin A; Cripps, Sally",Eur J Epidemiol,432,10

Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus.

SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the United States or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside California, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing. These results demonstrate that epidemiological surveillance through wastewater sequencing can aid in tracking exact viral strains in an epidemic context.","Crits-Christoph, Alexander; Kantor, Rose S; Olm, Matthew R; Whitney, Oscar N; Al-Shayeb, Basem; Lou, Yue Clare; Flamholz, Avi; Kennedy, Lauren C; Greenwald, Hannah; Hinkle, Adrian; Hetzel, Jonathan; Spitzer, Sara; Koble, Jeffery; Tan, Asako; Hyde, Fred; Schroth, Gary; Kuersten, Scott; Banfield, Jillian F; Nelson, Kara L",mBio (Online),432,24

In this study, we aimed to estimate the VE when combining the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. MethodsThis nationwide population-based cohort study estimated VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection, all-cause and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death after receiving the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose followed by an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. VE estimates were obtained using a Cox regression with calendar time as underlying time and adjusted for sex, age, comorbidity, heritage and hospital admission. Information on all individuals was extracted and linked from high-quality national registries. ResultsA total of 5,542,079 individuals were included in the analyses (97.6% of the total Danish population). A total of 144,360 were vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and of these 136,551 individuals received an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. A total of 1,691,464 person-years and 83,034 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine was 88% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83; 92) 14 days after the second dose and onwards. There were no COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths among the individuals vaccinated with the combination of the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine during the study period. ConclusionIn conclusion, this study found a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine, compared with unvaccinated individuals. This is similar to the VE of two doses of an mRNA vaccine. Longer follow-up time is needed to confirm vaccine induced protection against severe events, such as COVID-19 related hospitalization and death.","Gram, Mie Agermose; Emborg, Hanne-Dorthe; Moustsen-Helms, Ida Rask; Nielsen, Jens; Bjamp, Anne Katrine; Samp, oslashrkholt; oslashrensen,; Valentiner-Branth, Palle; Schelde, Astrid Blicher; Nielsen, Katrine Finderup",,432,21

Therapeutic targets have not been well characterized for auto-inflammatory syndromes, although the E3 ligase Synoviolin was previously shown to be a novel therapeutic target for RA. Here, we show that Synoviolin loss has little impact on a model of auto-inflammatory diseases. We previously established such a model, the hIL-1 cTg mouse, in which IL-1 signaling was constitutively activated, and animals exhibit symptoms recapitulating auto-inflammatory syndromes such as major joint dominant arthritis. Here, we crossed hIL-1 cTg with Synoviolin flox'd mice to yield hIL-1 cTg/Synoviolin cKO mice. Synoviolin gene expression was ablated in adult hIL-1 cTg/Synoviolin cKO mice by injection of pIpC to activate Mx1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase. However, symptoms seen in hIL-1 cTg mice such as arthritis and joint destruction were not alleviated by targeting Synoviolin, ruling out Synoviolin as a therapeutic target for auto-inflammatory disease. Our results indicate that although similar, RA and auto-inflammatory diseases are different diseases, and treatment strategies should differ accordingly.","Matsumoto, Tatsuaki; Sato, Yuiko; Kobayashi, Tami; Ito, Eri; Soma, Tomoya; Kimura, Atsushi; Miyamoto, Kana; Kobayashi, Shu; Harato, Kengo; Matsumoto, Morio; Nakamura, Masaya; Niki, Yasuo; Miyamoto, Takeshi",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,432,11

The virus enters the respiratory tract cells and other tissues via ACE2 receptors. Approximately 20% of infected subjects develop severe or critical disease. A cytokine storm leads to over inflammation and thrombotic events. The most common clinical presentation in COVID-19 is pneumonia, typically characterized by bilateral, peripheral, and patchy infiltrations in the lungs. However multi-systemic involvement including peripheral thromboembolic skin lesions, central nervous, gastrointestinal, circulatory, and urinary systems are reported.

However, the majority of the studies assess the effectiveness of an individual learning in VR, and there is a need to explore more on the effects of VR using different levels of immersion and collaboration. This paper presents an experiment to investigate knowledge transfer in a group-based learning game. We introduce a VR serious game to support teaching and learning processes in neuroanatomy health education. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 23 students to jointly assess learning, knowledge retention, and sense of presence. As a control condition, grouped students assembled a physical model of the human brain, while in the experimental condition, a virtual brain was assembled. In each group, one participant assembled the brain, while the others observed and verbally collaborated in a group-based learning strategy. Results shown high mean scores in the virtual condition. When comparing the knowledge test performance before and immediately after the experiment, we found significant difference only for the virtual condition. The same can be observed for retention. Because of the promising results achieved and motivated by the need of more engaging new tools for remote learning - fully used in quarantine conditions, such as the current one because of the Covid-19 pandemic - we conducted a pilot user study to evaluate the learning effect of a remote version of our collaborative VR game.","Souza, V.; Maciel, A.; Nedel, L.; Kopper, R.; Loges, K.; Schlemmer, E.; Ieee,",2020 22nd Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality,432,26

In Germany, AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention. General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants (aged 60-77 years, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia/CAIDE dementia risk score &#8805; 9). Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants, including neuropsychological assessments. We analyzed group differences between (1) eligible vs. non-eligible participants, (2) participants vs. non-participants, and (3) between intervention groups. Of 1176 eligible participants, 146 (12.5%) dropped out before baseline; the study population was thus 1030 individuals. Non-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk. Study participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women. The average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored &#8805; 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired.

To date, the virus has infected tens of millions of people worldwide, compelling governments to implement strict policies to counteract community spread. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments have employed various public health policies, including social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, and the closure of schools and businesses. However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the impact of social behaviour on the course of the pandemic in the province of Ontario. The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections. Importantly, the effective reproduction number, and thus the course of the pandemic, is found to be sensitive to the adherence to public health policies, illustrating the need for vigilance as the economy continues to reopen.","Eastman, Brydon; Meaney, Cameron; Przedborski, Michelle; Kohandel, Mohammad",PLoS One,432,26

Increasing evidence demonstrates a strong correlation between obesity and the COVID-19 disease. We have summarized recent studies and addressed the impact of obesity on COVID-19 in terms of hospitalization, severity, mortality, and patient outcome. We discuss the potential molecular mechanisms whereby obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition to obesity-related deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, endothelium imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, and its associated comorbidities, dysfunctional mesenchymal stem cells/adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may also play crucial roles in fueling systemic inflammation contributing to the cytokine storm and promoting pulmonary fibrosis causing lung functional failure, characteristic of severe COVID-19. Moreover, obesity may also compromise motile cilia on airway epithelial cells and impair functioning of the mucociliary escalators, reducing the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Obese diseased adipose tissues overexpress the receptors and proteases for the SARS-CoV-2 entry, implicating its possible roles as virus reservoir and accelerator reinforcing violent systemic inflammation and immune response. Finally, anti-inflammatory cytokines like anti-interleukin 6 and administration of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells may serve as potential immune modulatory therapies for supportively combating COVID-19. Obesity is conversely related to the development of COVID-19 through numerous molecular mechanisms and individuals with obesity belong to the COVID-19-susceptible population requiring more protective measures.","Ritter, Andreas; Kreis, Nina-Naomi; Louwen, Frank; Yuan, Juping",,432,24

This paper also demonstrates how researchers can integrate textual and visual features in machine learning models to study conspiracies on social media and discusses the implications of computational modeling for scholars interested in studying visual manipulation in the digital era. The analysis of visual and textual features presented in this paper could be useful for future studies focused on designing systems to identify conspiracy content on the Internet.","Chen, Kaiping; Kim, Sang Jung; Gao, Qiantong; Raschka, Sebastian",,432,21

Frontline epidemic prevention workers play a pivotal role against COVID-19. They must face high-risk infection conditions, insufficient anti-epidemic material supplies, mental pressure, and so on. COVID-19 seriously affects their dietary and behavioral habits, and poor habits make them more susceptible to COVID-19. However, their baseline dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of COVID-19 remain unclear for these workers in China. This study aimed to explore the baseline dietary and behavioral habits of frontline workers and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of the epidemic; in addition, susceptible subgroups were identified by stratified analyses as targets of protective measures to keep them from being infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a sample of 22,459 valid individuals living in China, including 9402 frontline epidemic prevention workers. RESULTS: Before COVID-19, 23.9% of the frontline epidemic prevention workers reported a high-salt diet, 46.9% of them reported a high frequency of fried foods intake, and 50.9% of them smoked cigarettes. After the outbreak of COVID-19, 34.6% of them expressed a willingness to reduce salt intake, and 43.7% of them wanted to reduce the frequency of pickled vegetables intake. A total of 37.9% of them expressed a willingness to decrease or quit smoking, and 44.5% of them wanted to increase sleep duration. Significant differences in the baseline dietary and behavioral habits and the willingness to change their habits were observed between frontline epidemic prevention workers and other participants. Among the frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19, frontline epidemic prevention experience was a promoting factor for adopting worse dietary and behavioral habits, including those in the high-salt intake subgroup (OR, 2.824; 95% CI, 2.341-3.405) and the 11-20 cigarettes/day subgroup (OR, 2.067; 95% CI, 1.359-3.143). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary and behavioral habits of frontline epidemic prevention workers were worse than that those of other participants before COVID-19. They had a greater willingness to adopt healthy dietary and behavioral habits after experiencing the outbreak of COVID-19. However, frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 continued in engage in these poor habits. Dietary and behavioral intervention policies should be drafted to protect their health, especially frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor habits at baseline.","Yu, Weijun; Xu, Ying; Zhang, Jianhua; Yuan, Qing; Guo, Yanfang; Li, Zhixue; He, Xiangyang; Ma, Yan; Cai, Fengmin; Liu, Zheng; Zhao, Rencheng; Wang, Dewang; Chen, Jialong; Guo, Quanwei",Environ Health Prev Med,432,27

We surveyed all NHS hospitals where surgery is undertaken. Response rates, by round, were 64%, 56% and 51%. Despite important regional variations, the surveys showed increasing systemic pressure on anaesthetic and peri-operative services due to the need to support critical care pandemic demands. During Rounds 1 and 2, approximately one in eight anaesthetic staff were not available for anaesthetic work. Approximately one in five operating theatres were closed and activity fell in those that were open. Some mitigation was achieved by relocation of surgical activity to other locations. Approximately one-quarter of all surgical activity was lost, with paediatric and non-cancer surgery most impacted. During January 2021, the system was largely overwhelmed. Almost one-third of anaesthesia staff were unavailable, 42% of operating theatres were closed, national surgical activity reduced to less than half, including reduced cancer and emergency surgery. Redeployed anaesthesia staff increased the critical care workforce by 125%. Three-quarters of critical care units were so expanded that planned surgery could not be safely resumed. At all times, the greatest resource limitation was staff. Due to lower response rates from the most pressed regions and hospitals, these results may underestimate the true impact. These findings have important implications for understanding what has happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, planning recovery and building a system that will better respond to future waves or new epidemics.","Kursumovic, E; Cook, T M; Vindrola-Padros, C; Kane, A D; Armstrong, R A; Waite, O; Soar, J",Anaesthesia (Lond.),432,16

XFEL experiments are a challenge to computing in two ways: i) due to the high cost of running XFELs, a fast turnaround time from data acquisition to data analysis is essential to make informed decisions on experimental protocols;ii) data collection rates are growing exponentially, requiring new scalable algorithms. Here we report our experiences analyzing data from two experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) during September 2020. Raw data were analyzed on NERSC's Cori XC40 system, using the Superfacility paradigm: our workflow automatically moves raw data between LCLS and NERSC, where it is analyzed using the software package CCTBX. We achieved real time data analysis with a turnaround time from data acquisition to full molecular reconstruction in as little as 10 min -- sufficient time for the experiment's operators to make informed decisions. By hosting the data analysis on Cori, and by automating LCLS-NERSC interoperability, we achieved a data analysis rate which matches the data acquisition rate. Completing data analysis with 10 mins is a first for XFEL experiments and an important milestone if we are to keep up with data collection trends.","Blaschke, J. P.; Brewster, A. S.; Paley, D.

The current study investigates alterations in the biological estimates concerning the severity, recovery, mortality, and assessment of treatment-based outcomes. Methods A case series of 165 COVID-19 patients admitted to OMI Institute (a tertiary care hospital) was conducted between May and August 2020. The data regarding demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, radiographic abnormalities, biological estimations, symptoms, treatment, disease progression, complications, and outcomes were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Laboratory estimations included complete blood count (CBC), renal and electrolyte profile, liver function tests (LFTs), hematological indices, and inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan were also performed, and data were extracted from the medical records. Analysis was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. Results Out of the 165 COVID-19 patients, 79.4% recovered and were successfully discharged, while 20.6% of inpatient died. The patients' mean age was 56.03 +/- 15.96 years, with a male majority (55.1%). The most common comorbid conditions were diabetes and hypertension;fever and dry cough were among the most frequently reported symptoms. The chest imaging findings among the severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed extensive bilateral patchy opacities. The median laboratory investigations, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (14.83), C-reactive protein (CRP) (7.4 mg/dl), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (786 IU/L), ferritin (1401.15 mcg/ml), and mean oxygen saturation (88.25%), were significantly altered among cases with increased disease severity and those who expired (p&lt;0.05). The proportion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis development was significantly high among severe/critical COVID-19 patients (p&lt;0.05). Treatment with tocilizumab, remdesivir, doxycycline, ivermectin, enoxaparin sodium, and steroids was deemed to be potentially effective treatment options in terms of reducing COVID-19 severity and chances of recovery. Furthermore, age (OR 1.05;p=0.047), presence of comorbidity (OR 8.471;p=0.004), high NLR, LDH (final outcome) (OR 1.361 and 1.018;p&lt;0.05), and CRP levels (midpoint) (OR 1.631;p=0.05) were identified as the strong predictors of death among COVID-19 patients. Conclusion The study identified several alterations in the clinical profile of the COVID-19 patients concerning severity during the hospital stay, affecting prognosis. Clinically, tocilizumab, remdesivir, doxycycline, ivermectin, enoxaparin sodium, and steroids were identified as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 due to their ability to alter disease-associated severity and recovery rate.","Ahsan, T.; Rani, B.; Siddiqui, R.; D039,; Souza, G.; Memon, R.; Lutfi, I.; Hasan, O.

METHODS: This prospective data analysis was based on chart reviews for laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs over a 1month period. The NEWS2, CURB-65, qSOFA and SIRS were calculated from the first recorded vital signs upon admission to ICU and assessed for predicting mortality. RESULTS: Total of 140 patients aged between 18 to 95 years were included in the analysis of whom majority were >60 years (47.8%), with evidence of pre-existing comorbidities (67.1%). The commonest symptom at presentation was dyspnea (86.4%). Based upon the Receiver Operating Characteristics-Area Under Curve (AUC), the best discriminatory power to predict ICU mortality was for the CRB65 (AUC: 0.720 [95% CI: 0.630 - 0.811]) followed closely by NEWS2 (AUC: 0.712 [95% CI: 0.622 - 0.803]). Additionally, a multivariate cox regression model showed Glasgow Coma Score at time of admission [P < 0.001; adjusted Hazard Ratio = 0.808 (95% CI: 0.715-0.911)] to be the only significant predictor of ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: CRB65 and NEWS2 scores assessed at the time of ICU admission offer only a fair discriminatory value for predicting mortality. Further evaluation after adding laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein and D-dimer may yield a more useful prediction model. Much of the earlier data is from developed countries and uses scoring at time of hospital admission. This study was from a developing country, with the scores assessed at time of ICU admission, rather than the emergency department as with existing data from developed countries, for patients with moderate/severe COVID disease. Since the scores showed some utility for predicting ICU mortality even when measured at time of ICU admission, their use in allocation of limited ICU resources in a developing country merits further research.","Tyagi, Asha; Tyagi, Surbhi; Agrawal, Ananya; Mohan, Aparna; Garg, Devansh; Salhotra, Rashmi; Saxena, Ashok Kumar; Goel, Ashish",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,432,16

COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia patients underwent retinal imaging 14 days after hospital discharge with structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) measurements. Vessel density (VD) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were evaluated in the superficial, deep capillary plexus (SCP, DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC). After exclusion criteria, only one eye per patient was selected, and 50 eyes (25 patients and 25 controls) were included in the analysis. COVID-19 patients presented significantly thinner ganglion cell layer (GCL) (p = 0.003) and thicker retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) compared to controls (p = 0.048), and this RNFL thickening was greater in COVID-19 cases with cotton wool spots (CWS), when compared with patients without CWS (p = 0.032). In both SCP and DCP, COVID-19 patients presented lower VD in the foveal region (p < 0.001) and a greater FAZ area than controls (p = 0.007). These findings suggest that thrombotic and inflammatory phenomena could be happening in the retina of COVID-19 patients. Further research is warranted to analyze the longitudinal evolution of these changes over time as well as their correlation with disease severity.","González-Zamora, Jorge; Bilbao-Malavé, Valentina; Gándara, Elsa; Casablanca-Piñera, Anna; Boquera-Ventosa, Claudia; Landecho, Manuel F; Zarranz-Ventura, Javier; García-Layana, Alfredo",,432,1

After discovering the vaccine, its acceptance by individuals is a fundamental issue for disease control. This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccination intention determinants based on the protection motivation theory (PMT). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Iranian adult population and surveyed 256 study participants from the first to the 30th of June 2020 with a web-based self-administered questionnaire. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate the interrelationship between COVID-19 vaccination intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived response efficacy. RESULTS: SEM showed that perceived severity to COVID-19 (ß = .17, p < .001), perceived self-efficacy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (ß = .26, p < .001), and the perceived response efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (ß = .70, p < .001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. PMT accounted for 61.5% of the variance in intention to COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived response efficacy was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the PMT constructs are useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention. Programs designed to increase the vaccination rate after discovering the COVID-19 vaccine can include interventions on the severity of the COVID-19, the self-efficacy of individuals receiving the vaccine, and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing infection.","Ansari-Moghaddam, Alireza; Seraji, Maryam; Sharafi, Zahra; Mohammadi, Mahdi; Okati-Aliabad, Hassan",BMC Public Health,432,26

Relics provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of star formation at high-z. In this paper, we present the first INSPIRE Data Release, comprising 19 systems with observations completed in 2020. We use the methods already presented in the INSPIRE Pilot, but revisiting the 1D spectral extraction. For these 19 systems, we obtain an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion, fitting separately the two UVB and VIS XSH arms at their original resolution. We estimate [Mg/Fe] abundances via line-index strength and mass-weighted integrated stellar ages and metallicities with full spectral fitting on the combined spectrum. Ages are generally old, in agreement with the photometric ones, and metallicities are almost always super-solar, confirming the mass-metallicity relation. The [Mg/Fe] ratio is also larger than solar for the great majority of the galaxies, as expected. We find that 10 objects have formed more than 75% of their stellar mass (M*) within 3 Gyr from the Big Bang and classify them as relics. Among these, we identify 4 galaxies which had already fully assembled their M* by that time. They are therefore `extreme relics' of the ancient Universe. The INSPIRE DR1 catalogue of 10 known relics to-date augment by a factor of 3.3 the total number of confirmed relics, also enlarging the redshift window. It is therefore the largest publicly available collection.

Methods: Public health standards used in COVID-19 prevention and control were selected for a systematic comparison with ""The Plan of COVID19 Prevention and Control"" (the 6th Edition) and other epidemic prevention and control guidelines from the perspectives of application scope and technical elements. Results: The current standards of public health are with scientificity, timeliness and feasibility. The application scope and technical elements of the current public health standards basically meet the needs of the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic, but the public health standardization system still needs improvement, and some public health standards need to be revised. Conclusions: The implementation of current public health standards can provide strong technical support for the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic. The experience obtained from COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control might promote the further improvement of the health standardization system.","Xu, X; Jiang, Y C; Yang, Y Q; Zheng, Y M; Sun, N L; Tian, C W; Yao, M J; Bing, P F; Li, J; Lei, S W",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,432,22

In this study, we screened a library of saRNA constructs with cis-encoded innate inhibiting proteins (IIPs) and determined the effect on protein expression and immunogenicity. We observed that the PIV-5 V and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a proteins enhance protein expression 100- to 500-fold in vitro in IFN-competent HeLa and MRC5 cells. We found that the MERS-CoV ORF4a protein partially abates dose nonlinearity in vivo, and that ruxolitinib, a potent Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor, but not the IIPs, enhances protein expression of saRNA in vivo. Both the PIV-5 V and MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins were found to enhance the percentage of resident cells in human skin explants expressing saRNA and completely rescued dose nonlinearity of saRNA. Finally, we observed that the MERS-CoV ORF4a increased the rabies virus (RABV)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) by â¼10-fold in rabbits, but not in mice or rats. These experiments provide a proof of concept that IIPs can be directly encoded into saRNA vectors and effectively abate the nonlinear dose dependency and enhance immunogenicity.","Blakney, Anna K; McKay, Paul F; Bouton, Clément R; Hu, Kai; Samnuan, Karnyart; Shattock, Robin J",Mol Ther,432,30

Causal loop diagrams were co-created with participants in real time with themes drawn afterwards from coded transcripts. Retailers' experience of COVID-19 included 'empty shelves' attributed to media and government messaging, product unavailability, and community fear. Customers reported fear of contracting COVID-19, unavailability of food, and government restrictions resulting in cooking more meals at home, as influences on purchasing behaviour.

Schools and families had to react rapidly to a new teaching and learning scenario without the benefit of previous planning or government guidelines. In this context, some schools were better able to adapt to the new circumstances than others. Likewise, the structure and size of families' economic, social and cultural capital produced significant differences in the learning opportunities for children from different backgrounds. This article assesses the impact of the school lockdown on the learning gap between children from different social backgrounds in Catalonia. Based on 35,419 responses to an online survey administered between 26 and 30 March 2020 to families with children aged between 3 and 18, the authors' analysis shows that learning opportunities varied significantly. Middle-class families were able to maintain higher standards of education quality in a critical context, while children from socially disadvantaged families had few learning opportunities both in terms of time and learning experiences (schoolwork and maintenance of after-school activities). Results differed by type of school (public/private) where students were enrolled, family economic, social and cultural capital, and family living conditions. In the final part of the article, the authors highlight the importance of the role of the school in ensuring learning opportunities for children from low socioeconomic backgrounds, and they discuss some policy implications of their findings.","Bonal, Xavier; González, Sheila",Int Rev Educ,432,27

Indeed, there is no clinical trial evidence that a dietary or pharmacological supplementation of any particular substance will increase the effectiveness of the immune defences. There are however three nutritional issues that deserve special attention under the present circumstances, namely vitamin D deficiency, excess salt intake and inappropriate alcohol consumption. Here is a short review of the current knowledge about the possible role of these factors in the immunity defence system and their potential impact on the modulation of the immune response to SARS-COV2 infection. DATA SYNTHESIS: For all of these factors there is convincing evidence of an impact on the immune defence structure and function. In the absence of RCT demonstration that increased ingestion of any given substance may confer protection against the new enemy, special attention to correction of these three nutritional criticisms is certainly warranted at the time of COVID pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the inappropriate intake of salt and alcohol and the risk of inadequate vitamin D status should be object of screening, in particular in subjects at high mortality risk from SARS-COV 2 infection, such as institutionalised elderly subjects and all those affected by predisposing conditions.","Iaccarino Idelson, Paola; Rendina, Domenico; Strazzullo, Pasquale",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,432,26

Several therapeutic strategies have been used until now but, to date, there is no specific therapy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we used canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1 beta to improve respiratory function and laboratory parameters compared with standard therapy (hydroxycloroquine plus lopinavir/ritonavir). METHODS: We enrolled 34 patients with mild or severe non intensive care unit (ICU) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): 17 patients treated with standard therapy and 17 patients treated with a subcutaneous single dose of canakinumab 300 mg. We collected data about oxygen supports and laboratory parameters such as inflammation indices and hemogasanalysis. We compared the data collected before the administration of canakinumab (T0), 3 days after T0 (T1) and 7 days after T0 (T2) with the same data from patients taking the standard therapy. RESULTS: We observed a reduction in inflammation indices and a significant and rapid increase in P/F ratio in canakinumab group, with improvement of 60.3% after the administration. We reported a significant reduction in oxygen flow in patients treated with canakinumab (-28.6% at T1 vs. T0 and -40.0% at T2 vs. T1). Conversely, the standard group increased the supply of high oxygen at T1 versus T0 (+66.7%), but reduced oxygen flows at T2 versus T1 (-40.0%). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adult patients with mild or severe non ICU COVID-19, canakinumab could be a valid therapeutic option. Canakinumab therapy causes rapid and long-lasting improvement in oxygenation levels in the absence of any severe adverse events.","Katia, Falasca; Myriam, Di Penta; Ucciferri, Claudio; Auricchio, Antonio; Di Nicola, Marta; Marchioni, Michele; Eleonora, Celletti; Emanuela, Sabatini; Cipollone, Francesco; Vecchiet, Jacopo",Immun.

We address the problem of inferring a causal direction from two observed discrete symbolic sequences X and Y. We present a framework which relies on lossless compressors for inferring context-free grammars (CFGs) from sequence pairs and quantifies the extent to which the grammar inferred from one sequence compresses the other sequence. We infer X causes Y if the grammar inferred from X better compresses Y than in the other direction. To put this notion to practice, we propose three models that use the Compression-Complexity Measures (CCMs) - Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and Effort-To-Compress (ETC) to infer CFGs and discover causal directions. We evaluate these models on synthetic and real-world benchmarks and empirically observe performances competitive with current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we present a unique application of the proposed models for causal inference directly from pairs of genome sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using a large number of sequences, we show that our models capture directed causal information exchange between sequence pairs, presenting novel opportunities for addressing key issues such as contact-tracing, motif discovery, evolution of virulence and pathogenicity in future applications.","Pranay, SY; Nagaraj, Nithin",,432,22

However, subsequent large prospective epidemiological surveys indicate that the risk for severe COVID-19 may be largely attributed to the multiple confounders operating in this highly heterogeneous population of patients rather than the cancer or its treatment per se. In this viewpoint, we critically discuss the conundrums of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and underscore mechanistic insights on the outcome of COVID-19 as it relates to cancer therapy and the type and status of the underlying malignancy. We emphasize the concept that not all cancer patients are at similarly high-risk for a complicated COVID-19 course and the need to develop a roadmap of translational and clinical research on COVID-19 in this challenging group of patients.","Chamilos, Georgios; Lionakis, Michail S; Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P",Clin. infect. dis,432,22

Minimally-invasive ultrasound-guided techniques, such as laser and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been recently introduced into clinical practice as an alternative treatment for symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Due to their efficacy and tolerability, these techniques have become increasingly available and their usage has been extended also to autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). Methods: In this narrative review, we will describe the studies reporting the therapeutic effects of RFA on AFTN, the studies reporting how RFA compares to the other treatment modalities, as well as the current indications for the use of RFA in patients with AFTN. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature search was independently conducted by three investigators on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception up to February 2020 to identify published articles concerning the effects of RFA on AFTN. Results and Conclusions: Current consensus statements and guidelines support the notion that RFA should be regarded as a first-line therapy for non-functioning benign thyroid nodules, while it remains a valid second-line option for AFTN treatment in case of contraindications or patient unwillingness to undergo surgery or radioiodine.","Cesareo, Roberto; Palermo, Andrea; Pasqualini, Valerio; Manfrini, Silvia; Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Stacul, Fulvio; Fabris, Bruno; Bernardi, Stella",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),432,33
449229,449229,449229,Gastrointestinal tract imaging findings in confirmed COVID-19 patients: a non-comparative observational study,17.695751,8.054905,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges and threats to the health care system, particularly affecting the effective delivery of essential health services in resource-poor countries such as Nepal. This study aimed to explore community perceptions of COVID-19 and their experiences towards health services utilization during the pandemic in Province-2 of Nepal. METHODS: The semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among purposively selected participants (n = 41) from a mix of rural and urban settings in all districts (n = 8) of the Province 2 of Nepal. Virtual interviews were conducted between July and August 2020 in local languages. The data were analyzed using thematic network analysis in NVivo 12 Pro. RESULTS: The findings of this research are categorized into four global themes: i) Community and stakeholders' perceptions towards COVID-19; ii) Impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on health services delivery; iii) Community perceptions and experiences of health services during COVID-19; and iv) COVID-19: testing, isolation, and quarantine services. Most participants shared their experience of being worried and anxious about COVID-19 and reported a lack of awareness, misinformation, and stigma as major factors contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Maternity services, immunization, and supply of essential medicine were found to be the most affected areas of health care delivery during the lockdown. Participants reported that the interruptions in health services were mostly due to the closure of health services at local health care facilities, limited affordability, and involvement of private health sectors during the pandemic, fears of COVID-19 transmission among health care workers and within health centers, and disruption of transportation services. In addition, the participants expressed frustrations on poor testing, isolation, and quarantine services related to COVID-19, and poor accountability from the government at all levels towards health services continuation/management during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that essential health services were severely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in all districts of Province-2. It is critical to expand and continue the service coverage, and its quality (even more during pandemics), as well as increase public-private sector engagement to ensure the essential health services are available for the population.","Singh, Devendra Raj; Sunuwar, Dev Ram; Shah, Sunil Kumar; Karki, Kshitij; Sah, Lalita Kumari; Adhikari, Bipin; Sah, Rajeeb Kumar",BMC Health Serv Res,432,10

But antiviral properties mechanisms are not well known, HCQ is a weak base that accumulates in lysosomes, modifies their pH, and interferes with some enzymes. In the lack of confirmed efficacy, the initial potential risk is not to expose patients to adverse effects. However, results from preliminary clinical studies have drawn inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of HCQ in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to sev-eral important weaknesses in research methodologies. Hypokalemia often occurs in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coron-avirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), possibly due to the particular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 with regard to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The wide use of HCQ, even against medical advice, will show an impact on ongoing clinical trials. It is important that we can recruite COVID-19 patients in these research studies to generate appropriate data regarding drugs that show promising efficacy against COVID-19. Currently, only doctors should be allowed to prescribe HCQ, and treatment should be confined to hospital settings, with proper car-diac and therapeutic drug monitoring.","Tagaev, Tugolbai; Mamatov, Sagynali; Imanalieva, Farida; Yethindra, Vityala; Zhumabekova, Altynai; Bazarbaeva, Aizhan; Parihar, Yogesh",Int.

METHODS: Disease Outbreak Response (DORS) measures implemented at our center and its satellite clinics included strict infection prevention, manpower preservation, prudent resource allocation, and adaptation of standard-of-care treatments. Critical day-to-day clinical operations, number of persons screened before entry, staff temperature monitoring, and personal protection equipment stockpile were reviewed as a dashboard at daily DORS taskforce huddles. Polymerase chain reaction swab tests performed for patients and staff who met defined criteria for testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were tracked. Descriptive statistics of outpatient attendances and treatment caseloads from February 3 to May 23, 2020, were compared with the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: We performed COVID-19 swabs for 80 patients and 93 staff, detecting three cancer patients with community-acquired COVID-19 infections with no nosocomial transmission. Patients who required chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery and patients who are on maintenance treatment continued to receive timely treatment without disruption. The number of intravenous chemotherapy treatments was maintained at 97.8% compared with 2019, whereas that of weekly radiotherapy treatments remained stable since December 2019. All cancer-related surgeries proceeded without delay, with a 0.3% increase in workload. Surveillance follow-ups were conducted via teleconsultation, accounting for a 30.7% decrease in total face-to-face clinic consultations. CONCLUSION: Through the coordinated efforts of a DORS taskforce, it is possible to avoid nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmissions among patients and staff without compromising on care delivery at a national cancer center.","Kwek, Jin Wei; Chan, Jack J; Kanesvaran, Ravindran; Wang, Michael L C; Neo, Patricia S H; Chia, Claramae S; Tham, Chee Kian; Chew, Lita S T; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Yap, Swee Peng; Dent, Rebecca A; Hwang, William Y K; Lim, Soon Thye",JCO Oncol Pract,432,14

Respiratory failure in COVID-19 might represent a novel pathologic entity. RESEARCH QUESTION: How does the lung histopathology described in COVID-19 compare with the lung histopathology described in SARS and H1N1 influenza? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to characterize the lung histopathologic features of COVID-19 and compare them against findings of other recent viral pandemics, H1N1 influenza and SARS. We systematically searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies published up to June 24, 2020, using search terms for COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and SARS with keywords for pathology, biopsy, and autopsy. Using PRISMA-IPD guidelines, our systematic review analysis included 26 articles representing 171 COVID-19 patients; 20 articles representing 287 H1N1 patients; and eight articles representing 64 SARS patients. RESULTS: In COVID-19, acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was reported in 88% of patients, which was similar to the proportion of cases with DAD in both H1N1 (90%) and SARS (98%). Pulmonary microthrombi were reported in 57% of COVID-19 and 58% of SARS patients, as compared with 24% of H1N1 influenza patients. INTERPRETATION: DAD, the histologic correlate of ARDS, is the predominant histopathologic pattern identified in lung pathology from patients with COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and SARS. Microthrombi were reported more frequently in both patients with COVID-19 and SARS as compared with H1N1 influenza. Future work is needed to validate this histopathologic finding and, if confirmed, elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings and characterize any associations with clinically important outcomes.","Hariri, Lida P; North, Crystal M; Shih, Angela R; Israel, Rebecca A; Maley, Jason H; Villalba, Jullian A; Vinarsky, Vladimir; Rubin, Jonah; Okin, Daniel A; Sclafani, Alyssa; Alladina, Jehan W; Griffith, Jason W; Gillette, Michael A; Raz, Yuval; Richards, Christopher J; Wong, Alexandra K; Ly, Amy; Hung, Yin P; Chivukula, Raghu R; Petri, Camille R; Calhoun, Tiara F; Brenner, Laura N; Hibbert, Kathryn A; Medoff, Benjamin D; Hardin, C Corey; Stone, James R; Mino-Kenudson, Mari",Chest,432,17

In particular we discuss the worst affected large countries like India, Brazil and USA for estimating effect of vaccination rate in expediting the end of the COVID-19 epidemic. We analytically simulated the dynamic evolution of active cases of these countries in the last nine months using the modified SIR model and then included the effect of vaccination to forecast the proliferation dynamics. We hence obtained the transmission parameters, the variation in the reproduction numbers and the impact of the different values of the vaccination shots in the expected curves of active cases in the coming times to predicted the timescales of the end of the epidemic.","Chaturvedi, Deepa; Chakravarty, U",Infect Genet Evol,432,21

One such opportunistic fungal infection is mucormycosis. Initially, it was debated whether a person taking immunosuppressants, such as corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies will be at higher risk for COVID-19 or whether the immunosuppresive state would cause a more severe COVID-19 disease. However, immunosuppressants are currently continued unless the patients are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection or are on high-dose corticosteroids therapy. As understood so far, COVID-19 infection may induce significant and persistent lymphopenia, which in turn increases the risk of opportunistic infections. It is also noted that 85% of the COVID-19 patients' laboratory findings showed lymphopenia. This means that patients with severe COVID-19 have markedly lower absolute number of T lymphocytes, CD4+T and CD8+ T cells and, since the lymphocytes play a major role in maintaining the immune homeostasis, the patients with COVID-19 are highly susceptible to fungal co-infections. This report is intended to raise awareness of the importance of early detection and treatment of mucormycosis and other fungal diseases, such as candidiasis, SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, pneumocystis pneumonia and cryptococcal disease, in COVID-19 patients, to reduce the risk of mortality.","Bhatt, K.; Agolli, A.; Patel, M.

The information about its clinical features, laboratory findings and prognosis in children and newborns is scarce. All the reported cases in pregnant women were in the 2nd or 3rd trimester and only 1% of them developed severe disease. Miscarriages are rare. Materno-fetal transmission of the disease is controversial. Definitive diagnosis can be made by a history of contact with a proven case, fever, pneumonia and gastrointestinal disorder and a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of nasopharyngeal swabs. Lymphopenia as well as liver and renal dysfunctions may be seen. Suspected or proven cases of newborns with symptoms should be quarantined in the neonatal intensive care unit for at least 14 days with standart and droplet isolation precautions. Asymptomatic infants may be quaratined at home. Transport of the neonates should be performed in a dedicated transport incubator and ambulance with isolation precautions. There is no specific treatment for the disease, but hemodynamic stabilization of the infant, respiratory management and other daily care are essential. Drugs against cytokine storm syndrome such as corticosteroids or tocilizumab are under investigation. Routine antibiotics are not recommended.

We aimed to describe the experiences of women in substance use disorder (SUD) recovery programs by (1) exploring the pandemic's impact on their lives, sobriety, and recovery capital and (2) tracking COVID-19 perceptions and preventative behaviors. METHODS: We conducted monthly semistructured interviews with women in residential and outpatient SUD recovery programs in Kansas City in April, May, and June 2020. Participants described the pandemic's impact on their life and sobriety and completed survey items on factors related to COVID-19 preventative behaviors. We interpreted qualitative themes longitudinally alongside quantitative data. RESULTS: In 64 interviews, participants (n = 24) described reduced access to recovery capital, or resources that support sobriety, such as social relationships, housing, employment, and health care. Most experienced negative impacts on their lives and feelings of stability in March and April but maintained sobriety. Four women described relapse, all attributed to pandemic stressors. Participants described relief related to societal re-opening in May and June, and increased engagement with their communities, despite rising infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: For women recovering from SUDs during COVID-19, securing recovery capital often meant assuming greater COVID-19 risk.

It seems reasonable to argue that the risk patterns for COVID-19 have to be usefully studied in quantitative terms too, whenever possible applying the same approach to the relationship 'dose of the exposure vs pathological response' commonly used for chemicals and already followed for several biological agents to SARS-CoV-2, too. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the fields of both occupational epidemiology and occupational medicine, where the identification of the sources of a dangerous exposure and of the web of causation of a disease is often questionable and questioned: it is relevant when evaluating the population risk, too. Specific occupational scenarios, basically involving health workers, exhibit important proportions of both subjects simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of ill subjects with, respectively, mild, moderate, and severe disease. Similar patterns have been described referring to various circumstances of community exposure, e.g., standing in crowded public places, travelling on crowded means of transport, living in accommodation or care homes, living in the same household as a COVID-19 case. The hypothesis that these findings are a consequence not only of high probabilities of exposure, but also of high doses (as a product of both intensity and duration, with possible autonomous effects of peaks of exposure) deserves to be systematically tested, in order to reconstruct the web of causation of COVID-19 individual and clustered cases and to cope with situations at critical risk for SARS-CoV-2, needing to be identified, mapped, and dealt with at the right time. A limited but consistent set of papers supporting these assumptions has been traced in the literature. Under these premises, the creation of a structured inventory of both values of viral concentrations in the air (in case and if possible, of surface contaminations too) and of viral loads in biological matrixes is proposed, with the subsequent construction of a scenario-exposure matrix. A scenario-exposure matrix for SARS-CoV-2 may represent a useful tool for research and practical risk management purposes, helping to understand the possibly critical circumstances for which no direct exposure measure is available (this is an especially frequent case, in contexts of low socio-economic level) and providing guidance to determine evidence-based public health strategies.","Calisti, Roberto",Epidemiol Prev,432,16

The chatbot intervenes during formative evaluations and identifies the student's misunderstandings and directs him/her at the end of the test towards the parts of the course dealing with the concepts that have not been mastered. In the context of covid-19, one of the barrier gestures being social distancing, face-to-face classes have been suspended. Many higher education institutions that were not prepared for e-learning suddenly switched to online courses in order not to lose the academic year. Students no longer have the follow-up that they had when they were learning face-to-face. The chatbot proposed in this work could help reduce the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic on the students' level. To allow learners to have a standardized learning environment, we have developed a plugin of the Moodle learning environment using the chatbot based on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) of Artificial Intelligence. In this work we show how our conversational chatbot is used for pedagogical remediation by indicating to the learner which chapters of the course to revise according to the gaps highlighted by the chatbot.","Gaglo, K.; Degboe, B.

Methods: Most models for projections of the spread and lethality of COVID-19 take into account the ambient temperature, neglecting light. Recent advances in understanding the mechanism of action of COVID-19 have shown that it causes a systemic infection that significantly affects the hematopoietic system and hemostasis, factors extremely dependent of light, mainly in the region of visible and infrared radiation. Results: In the COVID-19 patients hemoglobin is decreasing and protoporphyrin is increasing, generating an extremely harmful accumulation of iron ions in the bloodstream, which are able to induce an intense inflammatory process in the body with a consequent increase in C-reactive protein and albumin. Observing the unsaturation characteristics of the cyclic porphyrin ring allows it to absorb and emit radiation mainly in the visible region. This characteristic can represent an important differential to change this process in the event of an imbalance in this system, through the photobiomodulation to increase the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using red and near-infrared radiation (R-NIR) and vitamin D using ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. These two compounds have the primary role of activating the defense mechanisms of the immune system, enabling greater resistance of the individual against the attack by the virus. According to the theory of electron excitation in photosensitive molecules, similar to hemoglobin heme, after the photon absorption there would be an increase in the stability of the iron ion bond with the center of the pyrrole ring, preventing the losses of heme function oxygen transport (HbO2). The light is also absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in the R-NIR region, with a consequent increase in electron transport, regulating enzyme activity and resulting in a significant increase of oxygen rate consumption by mitochondria, increasing ATP production. Conclusions: The most favorable range of optical radiation to operate in this system is between R-NIR region, in which cytochrome c oxidase and porphyrin present absorption peaks centered at 640 nm and HbO2 with absorption peak centered at 900 nm. Based on the mechanisms described earlier, our hypothesis is that light could reduce the lethality of COVID-19.","Fernandes, Adriana Barrinha; de Lima, Carlos José; Villaverde, Antônio G J Balbin; Pereira, Pamela Camila; Carvalho, Henrique Cunha; Zângaro, Renato Amaro",Photobiomodul Photomed Laser Surg,432,20

Among the possible causes of this pathology, both the activation of vascular endothelial cells, leading to the exposure of tissue factor by these cells, and direct activation of the plasma hemostasis were named. Besides, there is a significant change in platelet responses to activation, which is not accompanied by significant thrombocytopenia. The mechanism of platelet dysfunction is rather controversial. On the one hand, there are suggestions that platelets can act as a direct “container” for the virus, thus spreading it throughout the body. On the other hand, the presence of viral RNA in platelets has been demonstrated in only one study, while other authors have obtained the opposite result. Another mechanism of the virus's direct effect on platelets is the penetration of the virus into megakaryocytes and the subsequent violation of thrombocytopoiesis. However, three of the four published works show that platelets from patients with SARS-CoV-2 are in an activated state (the so-called platelet pre-activation). This phenomenon can be caused by the direct influence of the virus and the effect of thromboinflammation in the lungs on platelet functions. Here we review the known data and possible causes of the platelet functionality changes observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2.","An, O. I.; Martyanov, A. A.; Stepanyan, M. G.; Boldova, A.

Here, analyzing viral loads of over 11,000 infections during the current wave in Israel, we find that even though this wave is dominated by the Delta-variant, breakthrough infections in recently vaccinated patients, still within 2 months post their second vaccine inoculation, do have lower viral loads compared to unvaccinated patients, with the extent of viral load reduction similar to pre-Delta breakthrough observations. Yet, this infectiousness protection starts diminishing for patients two months post vaccination and ultimately vanishes for patients 6 months or longer post vaccination. Encouragingly, we find that this diminishing vaccine effectiveness on breakthrough infection viral loads is restored following the booster vaccine. These results suggest that the vaccine is initially effective in reducing infectiousness of breakthrough infections even with the Delta variant, and that while this protectiveness effect declines with time it can be restored, at least temporarily, with a booster vaccine.","Levine-Tiefenbrun, Matan; Yelin, Idan; Alapi, Hillel; Katz, Rachel; Herzel, Esma; Kuint, Jacob; Chodick, Gabriel; Gazit, Sivan; Patalon, Tal; Kishony, Roy",,432,20

We ascertained IgG levels across a single US metropolitan site, Chicago, from June 2020 through December 2020.METHODSParticipants (n = 7935) were recruited through electronic advertising and received materials for a self-sampled dried-blood spot assay through the mail or a minimal contact in-person method. IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay.RESULTSOverall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than that detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3 to 4 months.CONCLUSIONQuantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicated more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentrations produced from these asymptomatic exposures was similar to IgG levels occurring after documented nonhospitalized COVID-19, which were considerably lower than those produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The differing ranges of IgG response, coupled with the rate of decay of antibodies, may influence response to subsequent viral exposure and vaccine.FundingNational Science Foundation grant 2035114, NIH grant 3UL1TR001422-06S4, NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences grants UL1 TR001422 and UL1 TR002389, Dixon Family Foundation, Northwestern University Cancer Center (NIH grant P30 CA060553), and Walder Foundation's Chicago Coronavirus Assessment Network.","Demonbreun, Alexis R; McDade, Thomas W; Pesce, Lorenzo; Vaught, Lauren A; Reiser, Nina L; Bogdanovic, Elena; Velez, Matthew P; Hsieh, Ryan R; Simons, Lacy M; Saber, Rana; Ryan, Daniel T; Ison, Michael G; Hultquist, Judd F; Wilkins, John T; D039,; Aquila, Richard T; Mustanski, Brian; McNally, Elizabeth M",JCI insight,432,27

However, data on clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in such settings are scarce. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess clinical characteristics and baseline predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients hospitalized after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a LTCF. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean age was 80 years (SD, 12 years), and 24/50 (57.1%) patients were males. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. At Cox regression analysis, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were: hypernatremia (HR 9.12), lymphocyte count < 1000 cells/µL (HR 7.45), cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (HR 6.41), and higher levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg/mL) (HR 1.005). Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Where restarting research activities is permitted, investigators need to evaluate the risks and benefits of resuming data collection and adapt procedures to minimize risk. OBJECTIVES: In the context of the multicountry Household Air Pollution Intervention (HAPIN) trial, we developed a framework to assess the risk of each trial activity and to guide protective measures. Our goal is to maximize integrity of reseach aims while minimizing infection risk based on the latest understanding of the virus. METHODS: We drew on a combination of expert consultations, risk assessment frameworks, institutional guidance and literature to develop our framework. We then systematically graded clinical, behavioral, laboratory and field environmental health research activities in four countries for both adult and child subjects using this framework. RESULTS: Our framework assesses risk based on staff proximity to the participant, exposure time between staff and participants, and potential aerosolization while performing the activity. One of of four risk levels, from minimal to unacceptable, is assigned and guidance on protective measures is provided. Those activities which can potentially aerosolize the virus are deemed the highest risk. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a systematic, procedure-specific approach to risk assessment for each trial activity, we can compare trial activities using the same criteria. This approach allows us to protect our participants and research team and to uphold our ability to deliver on the research commitments we have made to our participants, local communities, and funders.

Despite numerous studies in marine systems, little is known about diazotrophs and their functioning in oligohaline estuarine environments. Here we applied a combination of nifH transcript and metagenomic shotgun sequencing approaches to investigate temporal shifts in taxonomic composition and nifH activity of size-fractionated diazotrophic communities in a shallow and mostly freshwater coastal lagoon. Patterns in active nifH phylotypes exhibited a clear seasonal succession, which reflected their different tolerances to temperature change and nitrogen (N) availability. Thus, in spring, heterotrophic diazotrophs (Proteobacteria) dominated the nifH phylotypes, while increasing water temperature and depletion of inorganic N fostered heterocystous Cyanobacteria in summer. Metagenomic data demonstrated four main N-cycling pathways and three of them with a clear seasonal pattern: denitrification (spring) â N2 fixation (summer) â assimilative NO3- reduction (fall), with NH4+ uptake into cells occurring across all seasons. Although a substantial denitrification signal was observed in spring, it could have originated from the re-suspended benthic rather than planktonic community. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the realized genetic potential of pelagic N2 fixation and its seasonal dynamics in oligohaline estuarine ecosystems, which are natural coastal biogeochemical reactors.","Zilius, Mindaugas; Samuiloviene, Aurelija; Stanislauskiene, Ruta; Broman, Elias; Bonaglia, Stefano; Meskys, Rolandas; Zaiko, Anastasija",,432,5

This can be seen in the context of posttraumatic growth. These perceived changes refer to five main categories: Nature/Silence/Contemplation, Spirituality, Relationships, Reflection on life, and Digital media usage. A previous study with persons recruited in June 2020 directly after the lockdown in Germany showed that the best predictors of these perceived changes related to the Corona pandemic were the ability to mindfully stop and pause in distinct situations, to be ""spellbound at the moment"" and to become ""quiet and devout,"" indicating moments of wondering awe, with subsequent feelings of gratitude. Now, we intended to analyze (1) by whom and how strongly awe/gratitude was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) how these feelings relate to perceived changes and experienced burden, and (3) whether or not feelings of awe/gratitude contribute to participants' well-being or may buffer perceived burden in terms of a resilience factor.","Bussing, A.; Rodrigues Recchia, D.; Dienberg, T.; Surzykiewicz, J.; Baumann, K.",Frontiers in psychiatry Frontiers Research Foundation,432,1

Regarding screening for T2D, little has changed since The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and Diabetes Australia joint guidelines adopted the alternative HbA1c screening pathway in their 2016 edition (Table 1).1011 Most recently, a joint position statement was published by the Australian Diabetes Educators Association, the Australian Diabetes Society, the Dietitians Association of Australia, Exercise and Sports Science Australia and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia.12 In contrast with the RACGP guidelines, which focus on screening and diagnosing T2D in asymptomatic people, the newer guidelines apply a lower threshold when using the Australian type 2 diabetes risk assessment tool AUSDRISK13 to identify and screen for prediabetes that is defined by IFG, IGT and/or elevated HbA1c that are yet to meet the diagnostic criteria for T2D (Table 1). Both recommended FBG or HbA1c as a first-line investigation, with GTT being reserved for instances when the GTT results will influence the management of a borderline abnormal FBG result.1112 It should also be noted the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes remains contentious due to poor correlations between the three tests, poor reproducibility in adult and paediatric populations, and possibly different underlying pathophysiology.3 Consequently, the WHO, the American Diabetes Association, the RACGP, and the Australian joint position statement all use slightly different criteria for screening and diagnosing prediabetes.4'11'12 To further understand the extent to which changes to clinical practice guidelines and available pathology tests are being used in Australia to reduce progression along the T2D continuum, this study examined 10-year annual trends, from 2010-19, in the use of relevant MBS-funded T2D pathology testing by Australian doctors. Relevant MBS item numbers for pathology tests were identified by searching the Australian Government MBS Online14 with the terms 'diabetes', 'glucose', 'fasting glucose', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'glycated haemoglobin', HbA1c, 'Glucose tolerance test', 'GTT', 'Type 2 Diabetes', 'Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus' and 'T2D'.","Tijs, Louise Hunter Jennifer Molodysky Eugen",Australian Journal of General Practice,432,20

Control of odours is also socially important and believed to be a societal measure of cleanliness. Understanding the need for good cleaning and disinfecting is even more important today considering the potential spread of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus. While the flush toilet was a major advancement in achieving these objectives, exposure to pathogens can occur from failure to clean and disinfect areas within a restroom, as well as poor hand hygiene. The build-up of biofilm within a toilet bowl/urinal including sink can result in the persistence of pathogens and odours. During flushing, pathogens can be ejected from the toilet bowl/urinal/sink and be transmitted by inhalation and contaminated fomites. Use of automatic toilet bowl cleaners can reduce the number of microorganisms ejected during a flush. Salmonella bacteria can colonize the underside of the rim of toilets and persist up to 50 days. Pathogenic enteric bacteria appear in greater numbers in the biofilm found in toilets than in the water. Source tracking of bacteria in homes has demonstrated that during cleaning enteric bacteria are transferred from the toilet to the bathroom sinks and that these same bacteria colonize cleaning tools used in the restroom. Quantitative microbial risk assessment has shown that significant risks exist from both aerosols and fomites in restrooms. Cleaning with soaps and detergents without the use of disinfectants in public restrooms may spread bacteria and viruses throughout the restroom. Odours in restrooms are largely controlled by ventilation and flushing volume in toilet/urinals. However, this results in increased energy and water usage. Contamination of both the air and surfaces in restrooms is well documented. Better quantification of the risks of infection are needed as this will help determine what interventions will minimize these risks.","Abney, S E; Bright, K R; McKinney, J; Ijaz, M Khalid; Gerba, C P",J. appl. microbiol,432,20

To accelerate this process, we present a deep learning based generative modeling framework, CogMol, to design drug candidates specific to a given target protein sequence with high off-target selectivity. We augment this generative framework with an in silico screening process that accounts for toxicity, to lower the failure rate of the generated drug candidates in later stages of the drug development pipeline. We apply this framework to three relevant proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, namely non-structural protein 9 (NSP9) replicase, main protease, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Docking to the target proteins demonstrate the potential of these generated molecules as ligands. Structural similarity analyses further imply novelty of the generated molecules with respect to the training dataset as well as possible biological association of a number of generated molecules that might be of relevance to COVID-19 therapeutic design. While the validation of these molecules is underway, we release ~ 3000 novel COVID-19 drug candidates generated using our framework.

Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize the COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians.METHODSIRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2, 2020, to April 12, 2020.RESULTSFrom an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2306 residents. In 45.1% of programs, at least 1 resident with confirmed COVID-19 was reported. One hundred one resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with an additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with 1 in intensive care. Among specialties with more than 100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (P = 0.039). In 80% of programs, quarantining a resident was reported. Ninety of 91 programs reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. Sixty-five programs (74.7%) redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts.CONCLUSIONMany resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by specialty.FUNDINGNational Eye Institute Core Grant P30EY019007; Research to Prevent Blindness Unrestricted Grant; Parker Family Chair; University of Pennsylvania.","Breazzano, Mark P; Shen, Junchao; Abdelhakim, Aliaa H; Glass, Lora R Dagi; Horowitz, Jason D; Xie, Sharon X; de Moraes, C Gustavo; Chen-Plotkin, Alice; Chen, Royce Ws",J Clin Invest,432,1

Methods: A search was conducted on the US Clinical Trials Database and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center. The search date was from the establishment of the database to May 26, 2020, and the registration trials of new drugs for curing hepatitis B at home and abroad were included. Two researchers independently searched and screened the literature and extracted the data. Results: A total of 106 registered clinical trials of new drugs for curing hepatitis B were included (94 English registration websites and 12 Chinese registration websites), and the number of registrations had increased year by year. Among them, the proportion of therapeutic vaccines and core protein inhibitors were the highest, accounting for 27.4% (n = 29) and 22.6% (n = 24), respectively. The vast majority of clinical trials (n = 96, 90.6%) were in the early stages (Phase I and II). The subjects in phase I clinical trial were mainly healthy people and treated CHB patients, while the subjects in phase II clinical trial were mainly CHB patients who had achieved viral suppression after initial or post-treatment. The main evaluation indicators of Phase I clinical trials were the safety and tolerability of new drugs. The main evaluation indicators in about half of Phase II clinical trials were HBsAg negative conversion/quantitative decline. Overall, the number of clinical trials with the new design was small, accounting for 3.8% (4 / 106). There were relatively few trials of new drugs for curing hepatitis B on domestic registration websites, and the information provided was incomplete. Conclusion: The number of clinical trials of new hepatitis B drugs at home and abroad is increasing year by year, but most of them are in phase I and II, with few adopting new designs. In addition, the information integrity of the domestic website registration center needs to be improved.","Chen, S; Zhao, L H; Shan, S; Li, M; Sun, Y M; Zhou, J L; Wu, X N; Dong, R H; Kong, Y Y; Ou, X J; Ma, H; You, H; Jia, J D",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,432,6

Convenience sampling and a snowball sampling were adopted. We used General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and knowledge and behaviors questionnaire of community residents regarding COVID-19 designed by us to investigate the psychological status, disease-related knowledge, and the behavior of Chinese urban and rural residents during the pandemic.The average score of anxiety and depression among urban residents was 9.15 and 11.25, respectively, while the figures in rural areas were 8.69 and 10.57, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the levels of anxiety (Pâ<â.01) and depression (Pâ<â.01). Urban participants reported significantly higher levels of knowledge regarding COVID-19 in all aspects (transmission, prevention measures, symptoms of infection, treatment, and prognosis) (Pâ<â.01), compared to their rural counterparts.

Xin guan No.1 (XG-1) prescription is a preventive formula recommended by the Hunan Provincial Administration of TCM to prevent the pandemic of COVID-19. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the potential preventive mechanisms of XG-1 against COVID-19 in the combination of network pharmacology approach, single-cell RNA expression profiling analysis, molecular docking and retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM) database was used to determine the meridian tropism, active components and target genes of XG-1. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were conducted by R Cluster Profiler package (3.14.3). Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human lung (GSE122960) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed by R Seurat package (3.1.2). Cytoscape (3.7.2) was used to construct the interaction network. The main ingredients in XG-1 were identified by HPLC- Q-TOF- MS and used for molecular docking with COVID-19 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). A retrospective study of 47 close contact participants from Dongtang Community of Hunan Province was conducted to evaluated the preventive effect of XG-1. RESULTS: According to the network pharmacology analysis, XG-1 formula was closely related to lung-, spleen- and stomach-meridians and include a total of 206 active components and 853 target genes. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that XG-1 mainly regulated cellular amino acid metabolism process and neuroactive ligand-receptors interaction. The scRNA-seq profiling showed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was principally expressed in alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2). 153 genes were up-regulated in AT2 cells expressing ACE2 and 12 genes were obtained by intersecting with XG-1 target genes, of which 3 were related to immunity. Five main chemical ingredients were detected in XG-1 sample by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS. The molecular docking showed that Rutin, Liquiritin and Astragaloside â £ had a good affinity with COVID-19 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and ACE2. Compared with participants who didn't take XG-1, preventive treatment with XG-1gradules resulted in a significant lower rate of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that XG-1 exerts a preventive effect in close contacts against COVID-19. The underlying mechanism may be related to modulate immunity response through multiple components, pathways, and several target genes co-expressed with ACE2. These findings provide preliminary evidences and methodological reference for the potential preventive mechanism of XG-1 against COVID-19.","Wu, Huaying; Gong, Ke; Qin, You; Yuan, Zhiying; Xia, Shuaishuai; Zhang, Shiying; Yang, Jingjing; Yang, Ping; Li, Liang; Xie, Mengzhou",J Ethnopharmacol,432,1

Nanoluciferase (Nluc) insertion was used to compare the replication efficiencies of all constructs after electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA from the different clones. Deletion of C, E1, E2, or the complete structural protein genome region (C-ERNS-E1-E2) prevented the production of infectious progeny virus, whereas deletion of ERNS still allowed the generation of infectious particles. However, those &#916;ERNS viral particles were defective in virus assembly and/or egress and could not be further propagated for more than three additional passages in porcine SK-6 cells. These ""defective-in-third-cycle"" BuPV &#916;ERNS mutants were subsequently used to express the classical swine fever virus envelope protein E2, the N-terminal domain of the Schmallenberg virus Gc protein, and the receptor binding domain of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein. The constructs could be efficiently complemented and further passaged in SK-6 cells constitutively expressing the BuPV ERNS protein. Importantly, BuPVs are able to infect a wide variety of target cell lines, allowing expression in a very wide host spectrum. Therefore, we suggest that packaged BuPV &#916;ERNS replicon particles have potential as broad-spectrum viral vectors.IMPORTANCE The proteins NPRO and ERNS are unique for the genus Pestivirus, but only NPRO has been demonstrated to be nonessential for in vitro growth. While this was also speculated for ERNS, it has always been previously shown that pestivirus replicons with deletions of the structural proteins ERNS, E1, or E2 did not produce any infectious progeny virus in susceptible host cells. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that BuPV ERNS is dispensable for the generation of infectious virus particles but still important for efficient passaging. The ERNS-defective BuPV particles showed clearly limited growth in cell culture but were capable of several rounds of infection, expression of foreign genes, and highly efficient trans-complementation to rescue virus replicon particles (VRPs). The noncytopathic characteristics and the absence of preexisting immunity to BuPV in human populations and livestock also provide a significant benefit for a possible use, e.g., as a vector vaccine platform.","Dalmann, Anja; Reimann, Ilona; Wernike, Kerstin; Beer, Martin",J. virol,432,1

METHODS: A retrospective multi-site exploratory, descriptive design had 97 participants complete the Clinical Learning Environment Comparison Survey 2.0 after having experienced virtual simulation. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to examine differences among participants when grouped by degree program and level/term within the nursing program. RESULTS: Traditional clinical experiences met students' perceived learning needs for all degree programs of study for subscale items of communication, nursing process, holism, critical thinking, and self-efficacy. When grouped by level/term, traditional clinical experiences met all students' perceived learning needs for every subscale item. Manikin-based simulation met students' perceived learning needs for subscale items of critical thinking and teaching-learning dyad while virtual simulation met perceived learning needs for subscale items of nursing process, critical thinking, self-efficacy, and teaching-learning dyad.

SARS-CoV-2 Virus The outbreak first began in Wuhan, China, in December2019 and then expanded globally COVID-19 can result in illness ranging from mild to severe However, some of the affected individuals might be asymptomatic Symptoms of the disease may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure The main rout of disease transmission is person to person contacts Nevertheless, touching contaminated surfaces is also asserted to be the alternative way of transmitting the virus Since the emergence of COVID-19pandemic, due to the high rate of person to person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, widespread restrictions have been introduced all over the world to prevent the disease expansion Apparently, work settings have not been exempted from these restrictions as well The precise socioeconomic burden of the pandemic has not been estimated so far However, it apparently contributes to many adverse health- related issues in either the individuals who have to be present in their workplaces in this circumstance or the ones who must stay at home A considerable proportion of the affected individuals are working people who have to return to their workplace after the end of the quarantine period Considering the direct and indirect impacts of this situation on economic activities, it is crucial to decide on employees’ returning to work in a way that cutting the chains of transmission is maintained In other words, while evaluating an individual’s return to work the duration of the disease transmission ought to be taken into consideration Furthermore, this should assess the individual in terms of the disease complications which may have an impact on his performance or might make him more vulnerable to hazardous occupational exposures The objective of this article is to carry out a review of the current guidelines about deciding on the end of the isolation and return to work of employees recovered from COVID-19 Methods: The Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus databases were reviewed from 2019 to 2020 Furthermore, other relevant websites were also scrutinized including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Health Service (NHS) and Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education guidelines Results: Based on this review different strategies may be pursued regarding work resumption In many countries making decision is mainly based on CDC guidelines However, national health policy has been the major contributing factor in defining the return to work strategies in other parts of the world Generally, determining the timing of return to work in employees recovered from COVID-19 is mainly based on clinical symptoms (symptom-based strategy) and or Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) RT-PCR (test (test-based strategy) In the light of the potential limitations, deciding on choosing either symptom-based or test-based strategy should be made on a case-by-case basis For instance, considering that RT-PCR test may remain positive for even three months after the onset of the symptoms, it is likely that test-based strategy unnecessarily prolongs the period of isolation and work absence In other words, prolonged virus shedding might not necessarily be an indicator of contagiousness or transmissibility On the other hand, relatively high price of this molecular test alongside its inconclusive sensitivity are other factors limiting RT-PCR test Recently, serology tests investigating antibodies (immunoglobulin G and M) have also been addressed in addition to the aforementioned assessments Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M (IgG and IgM) are usually detectable in serum after the second week of the disease but the exact duration in which these antibodies can be found following infection is not known Notably, due to the fact that some individuals do not develop detectable IgG or IgM at all, negative serology test result oes not necessarily rule out that they have previously been infected It is noteworthy to mention that some cross reactions have been determined between SARS-CoV-2 and other types of coroviruses which might contribute to false positive serology test results On account of current limitations of such tests, their results should be interpreted alongside RT-PCR test, otherwise they would be challenging and misleading In the light of the fact that the risk of Covid-19 transmission is not similar for all job categories, as well as different tasks in one work setting, another factor which should be taken into account is occupational exposures Hence, performing detailed risk assessment by experts has a vital role in deciding on work resumption This process should be meticulously carried out on an individual basis for all specific work places and also for each job or group of jobs within a work setting Each risk assessment should consider the environment, the task, the threat, and the available resources, as well as ongoing preventive measures such as risk elimination strategies, engineering controls (such as physical barriers or proper ventilation) and personal protective equipment On top of that, employers should be informed about the significance of the employees’ participation in this process which can apparently guarantee the success of implementing preventive measures in the workplace It is noteworthy that while deciding on an individual’s return to work, the severity of the disease should also be taken into consideration since a severe illness can have a considerable impact on the person’s work ability and performance This is specially the case for those who were admitted to intensive care units (ICU) due to their critical illness Therefore, gradual return to the previous tasks and activities, in terms of work intensity and duration, should be encouraged in such cases Conclusion: There is a general consensus on ending isolation and return to work of the recovered individuals in a 10 to14-day period after the onset ofsymptoms and clinical improvement in the non-test-based strategy Regarding test-based strategy, current guidelines require two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests with at least 24-hour interval Presently, serologic tests are not recommended for making decision about returning persons to the workplace in the guidelines Other important factors that ought not to be overlooked include detailed risk assessment and the disease severity © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences All rights reserved","Rafeemanesh, E.; Rahimpour,

This ""taxonomic void"" limits our understanding of biodiversity patterns and processes in freshwater ecosystems, and the scale at which they operate. We used DNA barcoding to estimate lineage diversity (and the diversity of unique haplotypes) in 224 specimens of freshwater macroinvertebrates at a small spatial scale within the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW). In addition, we compiled available barcoding data to assess macroinvertebrate diversity at a broader spatial scale spanning the Isthmus of Panama. Consistently across two species delimitation algorithms (i.e., ABGD and GMYC), we found high lineage diversity within the PCW, with ~ 100-106 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) across 168 unique haplotypes. We also found a high lineage diversity along the Isthmus of Panama, but this diversity peaked within the PCW. However, our rarefaction/extrapolation approach showed that this diversity remains under-sampled. As expected, these results indicate that the diversity of Neotropical freshwater macroinvertebrates is higher than previously thought, with the possibility of high endemicity even at narrow spatial scales. Consistent with previous work on aquatic insects and other freshwater taxa in this region, geographic isolation is likely a main factor shaping these patterns of diversity. However, other factors such as habitat variability and perhaps local adaptation might be reshaping these patterns of diversity at a local scale. Although further research is needed to better understand the processes driving diversification in freshwater macroinvertebrates, we suggest that Neotropical streams hold a high proportion of hidden biodiversity. Understanding this diversity is crucial in the face of increasing human disturbance.","De León, Luis F; Cornejo, Aydeé; Gavilán, Ronnie G; Aguilar, Celestino",PLoS One,432,1

Many physicians have used these services to provide care and advice to their patients remotely. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide an overview of physicians' awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skill in using telehealth services in Libya. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we administered a web-based survey to health care workers in Libya in May 2020. The questionnaire collected information on physicians' general demographic characteristics, ability to use a computer, and telemedicine awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skills. RESULTS: Among 673 health care workers who responded to the survey, 377 (56%) and 248 (36.8%) reported high awareness and high computer skill scores, respectively, for telemedicine. Furthermore, 582 (86.5%) and 566 (82.6%) health care workers reported high knowledge and high attitude scores, respectively. We observed no significant differences in awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skill scores among physicians employed at public, private, or both types of hospitals. We observed significant differences in the mean awareness (P<.001), attitude (P=.001), and computer skill scores (P<.001) , where the score distribution of the groups based on the ability to use computers was not similar. Knowledge scores did not significantly differ among the three groups (P=.37). Respondents with professional computer skills had significantly higher awareness (&#967;23=14.5; P<.001) and attitude (&#967;23=13.5; P=.001) scores than those without professional computer skills. We observed significant differences in the mean computer skill scores of the groups (&#967;23=199.6; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to persist for a long time. Hence, policy programs such as telemedicine services, which aim to address the obstacles to medical treatment owing to physical distancing measures, will likely continue for a long time. Therefore, there is a need to train and support health care workers and initiate government programs that provide adequate and supportive health care services to patients in transitional countries.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Elhadi, Ahmed; Bouhuwaish, Ahmad; Bin Alshiteewi, Fatimah; Elmabrouk, Amna; Alsuyihili, Ali; Alhashimi, Ayiman; Khel, Samer; Elgherwi, Alsafa; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Albakoush, Ahmed; Abdulmalik, Abdulmuez",J Med Internet Res,432,16

We conducted a two-wave online panel survey in the context of China. With a general basis of the Street's three-stage model, our results indicated that social media failed to directly affect young adults' stress. Instead, fatalism completely mediated this relationship. Also, one's perceived social media exhaustion negatively moderated this mediation pathway. The findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for the use of social media to promote health, well-being, and quality of life among young people during public health crises.","Ngien, Annabel; Jiang, Shaohai",Health Commun,432,20

Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1-2 days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission. METHODS: As a result, we devised a retrospective study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 from data sourced via our medical records office. Subsequently, we identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome; if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Descriptive statistics were used in addition to tabulating the variables and corresponding values for reference. Variables are compared between the presymptomatic group and others via Chi-square testing and Fisher's exact test, accepting a p value of < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: Our analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients compared to males (p = 0.019) and these group of patients were likely to receive treatment (p < 0.001). Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic. CONCLUSION: As we have little means of identifying these silent spreaders, it highlights further the importance of general measures implemented to stop COVID-19 transmission like social distancing, face mask, and widespread testing.","Tan, Juen Kiem; Leong, Dalleen; Munusamy, Hemalatha; Zenol Ariffin, Nor Hazwani; Kori, Najma; Hod, Rozita; Periyasamy, Petrick",BMC Infect Dis,432,16

This study aimed to characterize the time course of parameters and outcomes of severe COVID-19 in relation to the timing of liberation from MV. This retrospective, single-center, observational study was performed using data from mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between 1 March 2020 and 15 December 2020. Early liberation from ventilation (EL group) was defined as successful extubation within 10 days of MV. The trends of respiratory mechanics and laboratory data were visualized and compared between the EL and prolonged MV (PMV) groups using smoothing spline and linear mixed effect models. Of 52 admitted patients, 31 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were included (EL group, 20 (69%);PMV group, 11 (31%)). The patients’ median age was 71 years. While in-hospital mortality was low (6%), activities of daily living (ADL) at the time of hospital discharge were significantly impaired in the PMV group compared to the EL group (mean Barthel index (range): 30 (7.5–95) versus 2.5 (0–22.5), p = 0.048). The trends in respiratory compliance were different between patients in the EL and PMV groups. An increasing trend in the ventilatory ratio during MV until approximately 2 weeks was observed in both groups. The interaction between daily change and earlier liberation was significant in the trajectory of the thrombin–antithrombin complex, antithrombin 3, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. The indicator of physiological dead space increases during MV. The trajectory of markers of the hypercoagulation status, inflammation, and PEEP were significantly different depending on the timing of liberation from MV. These findings may provide insight into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 during treatment in the critical care setting.","Kasugai, Daisuke Ozaki Masayuki Nishida Kazuki Hiraiwa Hiroaki Jingushi Naruhiro Numaguchi Atsushi Omote Norihito Shindo Yuichiro Goto Yukari",Journal of Clinical Medicine,432,22

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents with respiratory signs and symptoms in children. Presently, there are no local studies on the pulmonary manifestations and management of COVID-19 among children. Objective. Our study aimed to identify and describe the presenting respiratory signs and symptoms, oxygenation status, radiologic findings, blood gas analysis, and pulmonary interventions among children admitted for COVID-19. We also analyzed the clinical and radiologic variables associated with mortality. Methodology. This is a retrospective study using data obtained from a review of medical records from April 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020, at a tertiary government institution in the Philippines. All pediatric patients (0-18 years) hospitalized for probable or confirmed COVID-19 during the said time period were included in this study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine factors affecting mortality. Results. A total of 25 pediatric patients with a mean age of 7 years old (age range: 11 days to 18 years) were admitted for COVID-19. Cough (44%) and dyspnea (24%) were the most common presenting respiratory symptoms, while tachypnea (68%), crackles (36%), and peripheral oxygen desaturation (36%) were the most common respiratory signs. Indeterminate findings for COVID-19 such as multifocal or diffuse ground-glass opacities and/or consolidations were the most common radiographic abnormalities. Invasive ventilatory support was administered to 6 cases of severe COVID-19 and 4 critical cases. There were no variables that correlated significantly with mortality. Conclusion. Respiratory signs and symptoms were prominent in our cohort of children admitted due to COVID-19. Mechanical ventilation was required in more severe cases.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have announced that all nonessential planned surgeries and procedures should be postponed until further notice and only urgent procedures should proceed. Neurologic surgeries and procedures should not be delayed under the circumstance in which it is essential at saving a life or preserving functioning of the central nervous system. METHODS: With the intent to advise the neurosurgery team on how to adequately prepare and safely perform neurosurgical procedures on confirmed and suspected patients with COVID-19, we discuss considerations and recommendations based on the lessons and experience shared by neurosurgeons in China. RESULTS: Perioperative and intraoperative strategies, considerations, as well as challenges arisen under the specific circumstance have been discussed. In addition, a case of a ruptured aneurysm in a suspected patient with COVID-19 is reported. It is advised that all health care personnel who immediately participate in neurosurgical surgeries and procedures for confirmed and suspected patients with COVID-19 should take airborne precautions and wear enhanced personal protective equipment.

This study aimed to compare initial values and longitudinal changes in respiratory system compliance (CRS), oxygenation parameters and ventilatory ratio (VR) in patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pulmonary ARDS matched on oxygenation. METHODS: 135 patients with COVID-19 ARDS from two centers were included in a physiological study; 767 non-COVID-19 ARDS from a clinical trial were used for the purpose of at least 1:2 matching. A propensity-matching was based on age, severity score, oxygenation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and pulmonary cause of ARDS and allowed to include 112 COVID-19 and 198 non-COVID pulmonary ARDS. RESULTS: The two groups were similar on initial oxygenation. COVID-19 patients had a higher body mass index, higher CRS at day 1 (median [IQR], 35 [28-44] vs 32 [26-38] ml cmH2O-1, p = 0.037). At day 1, CRS was correlated with oxygenation only in non-COVID-19 patients; 61.6% and 68.2% of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pulmonary ARDS were still ventilated at day 7 (p = 0.241). Oxygenation became lower in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients at days 3 and 7, while CRS became similar. VR was lower at day 1 in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 patients but increased from day 1 to 7 only in COVID-19 patients. VR was higher at days 1, 3 and 7 in the COVID-19 patients ventilated using heat and moisture exchangers compared to heated humidifiers. After adjustment on PaO2/FiO2, PEEP and humidification device, CRS and VR were found not different between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients at day 7. Day-28 mortality did not differ between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (25.9% and 23.7%, respectively, p = 0.666). CONCLUSIONS: For a similar initial oxygenation, COVID-19 ARDS initially differs from classical ARDS by a higher CRS, dissociated from oxygenation.

Late paediatric presentations may lead to severe illness and even death. Maintaining provision of healthcare through a pandemic is essential. This qualitative study aims to identify changing care-seeking behaviours in child health during the pandemic and ascertain parental views around barriers to care. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with caregivers of children accessing acute paediatric services in a hospital in North-West London. Thematic content analysis was used to derive themes from the data, using a deductive approach. RESULTS: From interviews with 15 caregivers an understanding was gained of care-seeking behaviours during the pandemic. Themes identified were; influencers of decision to seek care, experience of primary care, other perceived barriers, experiences of secondary care, advice to others following lived experience. Where delays in decision to seek care occurred this was influenced predominantly by fear, driven by community perception and experience and media portrayal. Delays in reaching care were focused on access to primary care and availability of services. Caregivers were happy with the quality of care received in secondary care and would advise friends to seek care without hesitation, not to allow fear to delay them.

In this study we aimed to identify whether loneliness and physical activity were associated with worse mental health during a period of mandatory social distancing in the UK. DESIGN: Population-based observation cohort study. SETTING: Mental health data collected online during COVID-19 from an existing sample of adults aged 50 and over taking part in a longitudinal study of ageing. All had comparable annual data collected between 2015 and 2019. PARTICIPANTS: 3,281 participants aged 50 and over. MEASUREMENTS: Trajectories of depression (measured by PHQ-9) and anxiety (measured by GAD-7) between 2015 and 2020 were analyzed with respect to loneliness, physical activity levels and a number of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. RESULTS: In 2020, PHQ-9 score for loneliness, adjusted for covariates, was 3.23 (95% CI: 3.01-3.44), an increase of around one point on all previous years in this group and 2 points higher than people not rated lonely, whose score did not change in 2020 (1.22, 95% CI: 1.12-1.32). PHQ-9 was 2.60, 95% CI: 2.43-2.78 in people with decreased physical activity, an increase of 0.5 on previous years. In contrast, PHQ-9 in 2020 for people whose physical activity had not decreased was 1.66, 95% CI: 1.56-1.75, similar to previous years. A similar relationship was observed for GAD-7 though the absolute burden of symptoms lower. CONCLUSION: After accounting for pre-COVID-19 trends, we show that experiencing loneliness and decreased physical activity are risk factors for worsening mental health during the pandemic. Our findings highlight the need to examine policies which target these potentially modifiable risk factors.","Creese, Byron; Khan, Zunera; Henley, William; O039,; Dwyer, Siobhan; Corbett, Anne; Vasconcelos Da Silva, Miguel; Mills, Kathryn; Wright, Natalie; Testad, Ingelin; Aarsland, Dag; Ballard, Clive",Int Psychogeriatr,432,10

Because of this, it is important to investigate COVID­19 mortality and its predictors in one of the most densely populated regions of the country, Silesia Province. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to assess in­hospital mortality due to COVID­19 and the impact of sex, age, and coexisting diseases on the risk of death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The data analysis was based on discharge reports of patients with COVID­19 hospitalized between March and June 2020 in all hospitals in the region. Age, sex, hospital discharge status, and the presence of coexisting diseases were abstracted from the charts. RESULTS: In a group of 2830 in­patients with COVID­19, 325 died during hospitalization. COVID­19 deaths were associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17-1.96), older age (OR, 6.11; 95% CI, 4.5-8.31), and the presence of 3 or more coexisting diseases (OR, 4.78; 95% CI, 3.52-6.49). The most prevalent comorbidities were chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated in­hospital fatality rate for COVID­19 was 11.5%, which is lower than the average COVID­19 fatality rate in other European countries. The risk of in­hospital death was associated with sex, age, and the number of coexisting diseases, such as chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.","Kowalska, Malgorzata; Baranski, Kamil; Brozek, Grzegorz; Kaleta-Pilarska, Angelina; Zejda, Jan E",Pol Arch Intern Med,432,16

Currently, the number of active cases in Malaysia is less than 50% of the accumulated points. This paper will present the most accurate machine learning model to predict the number of new possibilities for 01/04-15/04/2020 (15 days). Notably, four machine learning models and one traditional statistical prediction analysis ARIMA have been trained, tested and evaluated. The results are compared to the actual data. We found that the multilayer perceptron neural network has outperformed all models in estimating the number of new positive cases in a specific time range. However, the ARIMA model performs better in predicting recovered and death cases than the machine learning models. We have applied the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute predictive error (MAPE) evaluation metrics to assess the model performance. The proposed approach can be viewed as a feasible alternative to forecast the new COVID-19 cases in Malaysia, where there is no constant seasonal trend and no past data sources for comparison. The proposed methodology is easily tractable and computationally efficient to demonstrate the number of new cases that are useful and beneficial in terms of control management. © 2021 IEEE.","Kamarudin, A.

The existence of an optimal control function is established and the Pontryagin maximum principle is applied for the characterization of the controller. The equilibrium solutions (DFE & endemic) are found to be locally asymptotically stable and subsequently the basic reproduction number is obtained. Numerical simulations are carried out to support the analytic results and to explicitly show the significance of the control.

MethodsA national cohort of 898 working-age Australians enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study, completing surveys before, during, and after a 112-day community lockdown in Victoria (8 July - 27 October 2020). Outcomes included psychological distress, mental and physical health, work, social interactions and finances. Regression models examined health changes during and following lockdown. ResultsThe Victorian lockdown led to increased psychological distress. Health impacts coincided with greater social isolation and work loss. Following the extended lockdown, mental health, work and social interactions recovered to an extent whereby no significant long-lasting effects were identified in Victoria compared to the rest of Australia. ConclusionThe Victorian community lockdown had adverse health consequences, which reversed upon release from lockdown. Governments should weigh all potential health impacts of lockdown. Services and programs to reduce the negative impacts of lockdown may include increases in mental health care, encouraging safe social interactions and supports to maintain employment relationships.","Griffiths, Daniel; Sheehan, Luke; Petrie, Dennis; Vreden, Caryn van; Whiteford, Peter; Collie, Alex",,432,12

We analyzed the selective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this end, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results indicated that most sites in the viral open reading frames (ORFs) evolved under conditions of strong to moderate purifying selection. The most highly constrained sequences corresponded to some nonstructural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein. Conversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a nonnegligible proportion of codons evolving under conditions of very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection was detected. The 6 bona fide positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor still exists and, if so, which animals it infects. Our data, however, indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common ancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are dangerous zoonotic pathogens; in the last 2 decades, three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused human epidemics. One of these is the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how, since its divergence from a closely related bat virus, natural selection shaped the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We found that distinct coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolved under conditions of different degrees of constraint and are consequently more or less prone to tolerate amino acid substitutions. In practical terms, the level of constraint provides indications about which proteins/protein regions are better suited as possible targets for the development of antivirals or vaccines. We also detected limited signals of positive selection in three viral ORFs. However, we warn that, in the absence of knowledge about the chain of events that determined the human spillover, these signals should not be necessarily interpreted as evidence of an adaptation to our species.","Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela",J. virol,432,1

METHODS: For this purpose, the data envelopment analysis approach was used to measure the efficiency, considering the number of personnel and vehicles and screened passengers as the input and output parameters, respectively. It was examined the efficiency of 10 IRCS's branches given 17 days of screening operation. For the analysis,the DEA SolverPro software 15a version was used. RESULTS: The results show that only one branch had been full efficient in using the resources while five branches showed less than 50% efficiency. This study reveals that it is unnecessary to use a fixed number of volunteers at different stations with different passenger numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Using resources without efficient planning can lead to direct costs such as food, transportation, and maintenance, as well as indirect costs such as burnout, fatigue, and stress when responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis should support IRCS's managers to move their valuable resources from inefficient to efficient centers to increase the screening rate and reduce the fatigue of aid workers for the next pandemic rounds.","Seddighi, Hamed; Baharmand, Hossein; Morovati Sharifabadi, Ali; Salmani, Ibrahim; Seddighi, Saeideh",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,432,1

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: NHS hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: 47 780 individuals (mean age 65, 55% men) in hospital with covid-19 and discharged alive by 31 August 2020, exactly matched to controls from a pool of about 50 million people in England for personal and clinical characteristics from 10 years of electronic health records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of hospital readmission (or any admission for controls), all cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney, and liver diseases until 30 September 2020. Variations in rate ratios by age, sex, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 140 days, nearly a third of individuals who were discharged from hospital after acute covid-19 were readmitted (14 060 of 47 780) and more than 1 in 10 (5875) died after discharge, with these events occurring at rates four and eight times greater, respectively, than in the matched control group. Rates of respiratory disease (P<0.001), diabetes (P<0.001), and cardiovascular disease (P<0.001) were also significantly raised in patients with covid-19, with 770 (95% confidence interval 758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132), and 126 (121 to 131) diagnoses per 1000 person years, respectively. Rate ratios were greater for individuals aged less than 70 than for those aged 70 or older, and in ethnic minority groups compared with the white population, with the largest differences seen for respiratory disease (10.5 (95% confidence interval 9.7 to 11.4) for age less than 70 years v 4.6 (4.3 to 4.8) for age &#8805;70, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for non-white v 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for white individuals).

The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of post-covid syndrome requires integrated rather than organ or disease specific approaches, and urgent research is needed to establish the risk factors.","Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Khunti, Kamlesh; Nafilyan, Vahé; Maddox, Thomas; Humberstone, Ben; Diamond, Ian; Banerjee, Amitava",BMJ,432,1

A smart mirror is suitable for encouraging mental comfort due to its approachability and scalability as an in-home AI device. From the aspect of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis for Korean lacks an emotion dataset regarding everyday conversation. Its significant differences from English in terms of language structure make implementation challenging. The proposed smart mirror LUX provides Korean text sentiment analysis with the deep learning model, which examines GRU, LSTM, CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Bi-GRU networks. There are four emotional labels: anger, sadness, neutral, and happiness. For each emotion, there are three possible interactive responses: reciting wise sayings, playing music, and sympathizing. The implemented smart mirror also includes more-typical functions, such as a wake-up prompt, a weather reporting function, a calendar, a news reporting function, and a clock.","Yu, Hyona; Bae, Jihyun; Choi, Jiyeon; Kim, Hyungseok",Sensors (Basel),432,16

The aim is to evaluate if Quantitative Chest CT could provide reliable information in discriminating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 31, 2020 until April 18, 2020, patients with Chest CT suggestive for interstitial pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled and divided into two groups based on positive/negative COVID-19 RT-PCR results. Patients with pulmonary resection and/or CT motion artifacts were excluded. Quantitative Chest CT analysis was performed with a dedicated software that provides total lung volume, healthy parenchyma, GGOs, consolidations and fibrotic alterations, expressed both in liters and percentage. Two radiologists in consensus revised software analysis and adjusted areas of lung impairment in case of non-adequate segmentation. Data obtained were compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Performance of statistically significant parameters was tested by ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: Final population enrolled included 190 patients: 136 COVID-19 patients (87 male, 49 female, mean age 66 ± 16) and 54 non-COVID-19 patients (25 male, 29 female, mean age 63 ± 15). Lung quantification in liters showed significant differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients for GGOs (0.55 ± 0.26L vs 0.43 ± 0.23L, p = 0.0005) and fibrotic alterations (0.05 ± 0.03 L vs 0.04 ± 0.03 L, p < 0.0001). ROC analysis of GGOs and fibrotic alterations showed an area under the curve of 0.661 (cutoff 0.39 L, 68% sensitivity and 59% specificity, p < 0.001) and 0.698 (cutoff 0.02 L, 86% sensitivity and 44% specificity, p < 0.001), respectively.

We analyzed the clinical severity and epidemiologic aspects of COVID-19 in consecutive children aged 0-18 years, referred with a suspicion of COVID-19 between February 1, and April 15, 2020. RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab was used to confirm COVID-19. 319 children met the criteria of a suspected case. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 15/319 (4.7%) patients (8 male; mean age 10.5 years). All of them had household contact with an infected relative. Five (33.3%) patients were asymptomatic. In 9/15 (60.0%) children, the course of the disease was mild, and in 1/15 (6.7%), it was moderate, with the following symptoms: fever (46.7%), cough (40%), diarrhea (20%), vomiting (13.3%), rhinitis (6.7%), and shortness of breath (6.7%). In the COVID-19-negative patients, other infections were confirmed, including influenza in 32/319 (10%). The clinical course of COVID-19 and influenza differed significantly based on the clinical presentation. In conclusion, the clinical course of COVID-19 in children is usually mild or asymptomatic. In children suspected of having COVID-19, other infections should not be overlooked.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and places healthcare workers at significant risk, especially during aerosol-generating procedures, including airway management. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review outlines the underlying respiratory pathophysiology of patients with COVID-19 and discusses approaches to airway management in the emergency department (ED) based on current literature. DISCUSSION: Patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection are at high risk for acute respiratory failure requiring airway management. Among hospitalized patients, 10-20% require intensive care unit admission, and 3-10% require intubation and mechanical ventilation. While providing respiratory support for these patients, proper infection control measures, including adherence to personal protective equipment policies, are necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. A structured approach to respiratory failure in these patients includes the use of exogenous oxygen via nasal cannula or non-rebreather, as well as titrated high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation. This review offers several guiding principles and resources designed to be adapted in conjunction with local workplace policies for patients requiring respiratory support. CONCLUSIONS: While the fundamental principles of acute respiratory failure management are similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, there are some notable differences, including a focus on provider safety. This review provides an approach to airway management and respiratory support in the patient with COVID-19.","Montrief, Tim; Ramzy, Mark; Long, Brit; Gottlieb, Michael; Hercz, Dan",Am. j. emerg. med,432,26

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine comments on Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau's COVID-19 daily briefings by YouTube users and track these comments to extract the changing dynamics of the opinions and concerns of the public over time. METHODS: We used machine learning techniques to longitudinally analyze a total of 46,732 English YouTube comments that were retrieved from 57 videos of Prime Minister Trudeau's COVID-19 daily briefings from March 13 to May 22, 2020. A natural language processing model, latent Dirichlet allocation, was used to choose salient topics among the sampled comments for each of the 57 videos. Thematic analysis was used to classify and summarize these salient topics into different prominent themes. RESULTS: We found 11 prominent themes, including strict border measures, public responses to Prime Minister Trudeau's policies, essential work and frontline workers, individuals' financial challenges, rental and mortgage subsidies, quarantine, government financial aid for enterprises and individuals, personal protective equipment, Canada and China's relationship, vaccines, and reopening. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to longitudinally investigate public discourse and concerns related to Prime Minister Trudeau's daily COVID-19 briefings in Canada. This study contributes to establishing a real-time feedback loop between the public and public health officials on social media.

With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program. Here, we present niche models produced through citizen science tick collections over two years. Despite obvious limitations with citizen science collections, the models are consistent with previously-predicted species ranges in California that utilized more than thirty years of traditional surveillance data. Additionally, citizen science allows for an expanded understanding of I. pacificus distribution in Oregon and Washington. With the potential for rapid environmental changes instigated by a burgeoning human population and rapid climate change, the development of tools, concepts, and methodologies that provide rapid, current, and accurate assessment of important ecological qualities will be invaluable for monitoring and predicting disease across time and space.","Porter, W Tanner; Barrand, Zachary A; Wachara, Julie; DaVall, Kaila; Mihaljevic, Joseph R; Pearson, Talima; Salkeld, Daniel J; Nieto, Nathan C",PLoS One,432,16

Historical evidence points to large upfront effects from pandemics and natural disasters, but the medium-term outcomes are mixed, with policy responses a crucial determinant. Longer recessions and financial crises tend to lead to weaker medium-term growth. ▪ The coronavirus may trigger annual GDP declines among the worst seen in the last 100 years. Economies can bounce back sharply after such declines, but our analysis suggests output losses also endure in a significant number of cases. ▪ The US interwar experience shows the danger of allowing financial distress to snowball and exacerbate GDP declines. The weakness of medium-term growth after the global financial crisis confirms the long-term impact of such distress. ▪ A key risk for the medium term is that firms and/or households react to the coronavirus recession and disruption by raising savings, accelerating a shift toward ‘Japanification’ of major economies. ▪ Our baseline forecasts envisage moderate medium-term output losses due to coronavirus, in part reflecting rapid and large-scale policy interventions.

In the past few years, developing nations' government entities and political parties started using social media platforms to broadcast important information regarding decisions made at the state level. Pakistan is among those countries. Therefore, this study aims to empirically investigate the impact of the government agency's provision of quality information on social media in establishing trust among citizens of Pakistan in a government agency with an underlying mechanism of citizens' perception about agency's transparency and responsiveness along with moderating role of perceived government response on COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach Data was collected from 542 social media followers of the Associated Press of Pakistan (a government news agency) and was analysed using measurement and structural models by using SmartPLS 3.3.0. Findings Results revealed that the interactive effect of government response on COVID-19 and government agency's provision of quality information on social media strengthens the association of government presence on social media with citizens' perception of the agency's transparency and responsiveness and their trust in the agency. Practical implications Furthermore, the current study will contribute to the body of knowledge regarding the government agency's use of information and communication technology and the government's resultant response on COVID-19. Originality/value An extensive study of the literature revealed a gap available regarding the mediatory role of the citizens' perception about agency's transparency and responsiveness in between the association of government agency's provision of quality information on social media and citizens' trust in the government agency. Also, to the best of the author's knowledge, no study to date has investigated the moderating role of government response on COVID-19 in between the relationship of government agency's provision of quality on social media and citizens' trust in the government agency and their perception about agency's transparency and responsiveness. Thus, the current study aimed to address these existing gaps in the literature.","Mansoor, M.",Transforming Government- People Process and Policy,432,16

We report on the safety of elective orthopaedic surgery with high rates of community transmission. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study on consecutive NHS patients attending three private hospitals between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020. Patients attended preoperative assessment, including coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptom screening, were instructed to self-isolate for 14 days and had a negative COVID-19 swab within 72 hours of surgery. Patient age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, body mass index, surgery performed, type of anaesthetic and length of stay were collected. Our primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 swab, secondary outcomes were COVID-19 symptoms, readmission, surgical complications and mortality. RESULTS: Between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020, 191 patients were admitted to three private hospitals for elective surgery; 121 (67%) patients underwent general or regional anaesthetic, 179 patients were ASA grades 1 or 2 (94%) and 12 (6%) were ASA 3. In total, 187 (98%) patients were successfully contacted at 30 days postoperative and no COVID-19 symptoms, positive COVID-19 swabs or mortality or were recorded. One patient was readmitted following a pulmonary embolism and two patients were treated as outpatients for a deep vein thrombosis and a superficial infection. CONCLUSION: With 'green pathways' elective orthopaedic surgery can safely be performed while rates of COVID-19 in the community are high.","Dickenson, E J; Jordan, R W; Poole, C; Shyamalan, G; Arbuthnot, J; Makrides, P; Smith, N A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,432,24

Based on an extended SEIR model and continuous-time optimal control theory, in this paper the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy is presented for the case that a vaccine is never found and complete containment (eradication of the epidemic) is impossible. In this case, the optimal control must meet competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related deaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of natural immunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave. Moreover, the socio-economic costs of the intervention shall be kept at a minimum. The numerically computed optimal control strategy is a single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated interventions and simple""flattening of the curve"". Careful analysis of the resulting evolution of the time-dependent effective reproduction number reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in fact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where socio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced against one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Germany.","Kantner, Markus; Koprucki, Thomas",,432,16

Therefore, these patients need to take additional precautions against the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aimed to examine factors associated with precautionary behavior among Israeli breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of knowledge about COVID-19, perceived threat, sense of mastery, social support, precautionary behavior, and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multivariate regression model was calculated with precautionary behavior as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The mean of precautionary behavior score was relatively high. Participants perceived their health as relatively good, had relatively high knowledge about COVID-19, and moderate perceived threat. Sense of mastery was relatively moderate and perceived social support was relatively high. In the multivariate regression analysis, after controlling for the background variables, knowledge about COVID-19 (F(2,149) = 8.68, p < 0.001; beta = 0.36) was significantly associated with precautionary behavior. This variable explained 15.4% of the precautionary behavior variance.

In addition, the limitations of the myocarditis diagnosis were discussed since only fulminant myocarditis cases have been mentioned in the current literature. METHODS: We performed a review of the literature of all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane. RESULTS: 16 case reports were found to be related to COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. We observed that the ECG findings in most of the COVID-19 patients were non-specific, including diffuse ST-segment elevation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, sinus tachycardia, and inverted T-waves in anterior leads. Echocardiographic findings of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis patients ranged from preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without segmental abnormalities to reduced LVEF with global hypokinesia.

We have developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of such measures in the number of infected cases and peak of infection. We estimate the peak to be around 2 million infected cases by the beginning of May if no additional measures are taken. The model shows that current measures effectively isolated 25-30% of the population, contributing to some reduction on the infection peak.

In Spain, this measure was first extended to open public spaces and later made mandatory regardless of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept. At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The mandatory use of masks poses some ethical questions. Firstly, it entails a paternalistic action. Secondly, application of the principle of precaution becomes questionable when there is no clear benefit-risk relationship. Thirdly, compulsoriness can interfere with equity of public health actions. Fourthly, it can result in social stigma and discrimination against those who do not wear one, even though they well may have good reasons for doing so. Lastly, this measure may generate confusion in the population, along with an altered perception of the risk. The World Health Organization recommends its use in public places with a high potential risk of transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible. Mandatory use of masks in public open spaces, regardless of the risk of transmission or of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept, is an intrusive measure that restricts individual freedoms, and would not appear to be justified on the basis of available scientific evidence.

Targeting these enzymes with inhibitors to restore epigenetic homeostasis has been explored for many cancers. Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy that primarily affects children and young adults, is notable for widespread genetic and epigenetic instability. This may explain why therapy directed at unique molecular pathways has failed to substantially improve outcomes in osteosarcoma over the past four decades.

The advent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further enhanced their use. We reviewed published efficacy data for the original and modified formulations. Only efficacy data according to the European Norms (EN) were found. The bactericidal efficacy of the original formulations was, under practical conditions, partly insufficient (EN 1500, only effective in 60 s; EN 12791, efficacy too low in 5 min). The first modification with higher alcohol concentrations improves their efficacy as hygienic hand rub (effective in 30 s). The second (0.725% glycerol) and third (0.5% glycerol) modification improves their efficacy for surgical hand preparation (effective in 5 and 3 min). The original and second modified formulations were tested and demonstrate activity against enveloped viruses including severe acute resiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 30 s. The ethanol-based formulation is also active against some non-enveloped test viruses in 60 s (suspension tests, EN 14476). In-vivo data on the formulations would provide a more reliable result on the virucidal efficacy on contaminated hands but are currently not available.

Despite their utility, comprehensive autopsy studies are somewhat lacking relative to the global burden of disease, and very few comprehensive studies contextualize the findings to other fatal viral infections. We developed a novel autopsy protocol in order to perform postmortem examinations on victims of COVID-19 and herein describe detailed clinical information, gross findings, and histologic features observed in the first 16 complete COVID-19 autopsies. We also critically evaluated the role of ancillary studies used to establish a diagnosis of COVID-19 at autopsy, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and electron microscopy (EM). IHC and ISH targeting SARS-CoV-2 were comparable in terms of the location and number of infected cells in lung tissue; however, nonspecific staining of bacteria was seen occasionally with IHC. EM was unrevealing in blindly sampled tissues. We then compared the clinical and histologic features present in this series to six archival cases of fatal seasonal influenza and six archival cases of pandemic influenza from the fourth wave of the 'Spanish Flu' in the winter of 1920. In addition to routine histology, the inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza victims were compared using quantitative IHC. Our results demonstrate that the clinical and histologic features of COVID-19 are similar to those seen in fatal cases of influenza, and the two diseases tend to overlap histologically. There was no significant difference in the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in COVID-19 and influenza at sites of acute lung injury at the time of autopsy. Our study underscores the relatively nonspecific clinical features and pathologic changes shared between severe cases of COVID-19 and influenza, while also providing important caveats to ancillary methods of viral detection.","McMullen, Phillip; Pytel, Peter; Snyder, Alexis; Smith, Heather; Vickery, Jasmine; Brainer, James; Guzy, Robert; Wu, David; Schoettler, Nathan; Adegunsoye, Ayodeji; Sperling, Anne; Hart, John; Alpert, Lindsay; Chang, Anthony; Gurbuxani, Sandeep; Krausz, Thomas; Husain, Aliya N; Mueller, Jeffrey","J. pathol., Clin. res",432,23

To tackle the complexity of COVID-19 expansion on a spatial-temporal scale, this research appropriately analyzed the spatial-temporal heterogeneity at the county-level in Texas. First, the impact factors of COVID-19 are captured on social, economic, and environmental multiple facets, and the communality is extracted through principal component analysis (PCA). Second, this research uses COVID-19 cumulative case as the dependent variable and the common factors as the independent variables. According to the virus prevalence hierarchy, the spatial-temporal disparity is categorized into four quarters in the GWR analysis model. The findings exhibited that GWR models provide higher fitness and more geodata-oriented information than OLS models. In El Paso, Odessa, Midland, Randall, and Potter County areas in Texas, population, hospitalization, and age structures are presented as static, positive influences on COVID-19 cumulative cases, indicating that they should adopt stringent strategies in curbing COVID-19. Winter is the most sensitive season for the virus spread, implying that the last quarter should be paid more attention to preventing the virus and taking precautions. This research is expected to provide references for the prevention and control of COVID-19 and related infectious diseases and evidence for disease surveillance and response systems to facilitate the appropriate uptake and reuse of geographical data.","Wu, Xiu; Zhang, Jinting",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Wuhan, Hubei Province (1) The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a virus also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified by China in January 2020 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and on March 11, it announced that COVID-19 could develop into a global pandemic (2-3) As of February 8, 2021, there had been 105,805,951 confirmed cases, 2,312,278 confirmed deaths, and 223 countries, areas or territories were effected (4) Through one year’s efforts, different countries around the world achieved varying results in pandemic control In some countries like China, the pandemic has been well controlled, while in other countries the situation is still grim China initiated a national campaign against COVID-19 immediately after identifying this new virus In around two months, the daily increase in domestic cases fell to single digits;and in approximately three months, a decisive victory was secured in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city of Wuhan (5) The overarching strategy was early containment, and the key was active case identification and management (6) “Four Earlies” (early detection, early reporting, early isolation/quarantine, and early treatment) were the primary requirements for the implementation of all control measures All communities, organizations and citizens were mobilized to participate in pandemic prevention and control (7-8) Then a suppression strategy was implemented by establishing a strong and flexible response mechanism, implementing, or lifting control measures based on the results of surveillance and risk assessment in different regions Now we have entered the late stage of suppression In the winter and spring season of 2020–2021, large-scale local outbreaks were detected in the rural areas of Hebei, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, and more than 2,000 cases were reported in total (9-10) After unremitting efforts of containment and suppression, the local outbreaks were successfully controlled As of January 2021, more than 230 COVID-19 candidate vaccines had been in clinical or pre-clinical development globally (11), including inactivated or live virus vaccines, virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines (mRNA and DNA), virus-like particles, and nanoparticles, each having discrete advantages and shortcomings China has chosen 5 platforms to develop COVID-19 vaccines As of February 3, 2021, 31 million doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines had been administered in China, targeting high-risk groups, including healthcare/frontline personnel, essential workers who are critical to maintain the social performance, cold-chain industry employees and people working or studying overseas (12) As vaccination started smoothly and progressed as scheduled, China CDC has been closely monitoring vaccination coverage and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) The data shows that the reported rate of serious adverse events is no higher than that of the influenza vaccine, reflecting the fact that the currently used inactivated COVID-19 vaccines (13) are safe This is because the Chinese government has always made the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines a priority and the Chinese vaccine manufactures are pushing forward vaccine development in strict scientific and regulatory process;2021 will be a year of vaccination against COVID-19 among broad populations based on the strategy of prioritization COVID-19 vaccines have raised hope of reducing infected cases and virus transmission and getting life back to normal soon Looking into the future, there will still be many uncertainties in 2021 One of them is that the COVID-19 pandemic might become a lasting epidemic or endemic Furthermore, many new characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported, such as long-term sequelae, reinfection, reoccurrence of viral RNA, and long-time or intermittent latency Therefore, although we have developed vaccines, there are still many uncertainties The emergence of new virus variants of concern (VOC) leading to increased transmissibility and deteriorating epidemiological situations have brought greater challenges, leaving us a lot of work to do When facing a new virus, mankind still

In this paper we analyze the polarization build-up in detail and show that in this case DNP is due to the cross-effect (CE) and that the build-up rate can be quantitatively interpreted as the rate of the triple spin flips responsible for the CE.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak poses a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses are limited. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. METHODS: An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools include the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: The scores of SAS, SOS and GSES range from 20 to 80, 22 to 110 and 10 to 40, respectively, and the SAS (31.79 ± 7.32) and SOS (40.19 ± 12.92) and GSES scores (24.83 ± 6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (r = .679, p < .001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r = -.326, p < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (p = .006, <.001, <.001, .039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 were under a low level of anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The current study suggests work stress reduction might be a key factor in reducing anxiety and maintaining mental health to support nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection.","Mo, Yuanyuan; Deng, Lan; Zhang, Liyan; Lang, Qiuyan; Pang, He; Liao, Chunyan; Wang, Nannan; Tao, Pinyue; Huang, Huiqiao",J. clin. nurs,432,1

A total of 41 patients were included in the study. Before the pandemic began they had been seen at our unit at weekly intervals. During lockdown from March 9, 2020, to May 18, 2020 subjects were not allowed to enter the hospital unless they needed urgency or emergency surgery, or oncological management. During the second lockdown, from October 19, 2020, to December 11, 2020 patients could be followed up at distance by direct outreach including telephoning contacts. Data obtained early after each lockdown were compared with those obtained prior to the pandemic. Data for the first lockdown show that pain intensified and there was an increase in the recurrence rate of wounds, of their severity, and of superimposed infections as compared with the prelockdown period. The risk of lower-limb amputation was also considerably greater. During the second and less restrictive lockdown, patients were followed up by telemedicine and data indicate that skin lesions had not worsened any further. The management of vascular wounds was impacted by the pandemic unfavorably with health care failures in the hospital as well as in the primary care settings. In conclusion, the treatment of vascular leg ulcers is challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic as this spreads worldwide. This seems to be in keeping with what happens for other diseases. The data we obtained indicate that the pandemic-related lockdown has a deleterious effect on vascular skin wounds, with an increase of severity and mortality risk.

Within rail organizations, we saw changes to communication and control structures, new challenges related to balancing priorities (managing risk of rail accidents vs. virus transmission risk), and negative impacts on job design offset by increased informal support for frontline workers. Importantly, from the crisis, we gained new insights about culture.

Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during India's March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown. RESULTS: Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95% CI 0.367-0.824; p = 0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10-12 months (OR 1.761; 95% CI 1.196-2.591; p = 0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95% CI 0.478-0.816; p = 0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, despite their younger age. First-year immunization coverage among heavily exposed children decreased by 6.9 pp to 10.4 pp (9.7% to 14.0%). Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4-5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.","Jain, Radhika; Chopra, Ambika; Falézan, Camille; Patel, Mustufa; Dupas, Pascaline",Vaccine,432,15

Lockdowns, physical spacing, transport restrictions and stay-at-home guidelines have transformed personal mobility and highlighted the mistakes of an unbalanced pro-car culture that defined a century of urban planning. One immediate effect of the virus in relation to travel demand and supply was the emergence of active travel modes because of their unique ability to provide a socially distanced way of transport. Cycling is one of the modes that has enjoyed significant attention. Numerous cities have reallocated street and public space to cyclists and introduced pro-bike interventions like pop-up cycle lanes, e-bike subsidies, free bike-share use and traffic calming measures. This newly found outbreak-induced momentum creates an opportunity to establish a new ethos that allows the promotion of potentially permanent strategies that may help cycling to be (re-)established as a robust, mainstream and resilient travel mode for inner city trips and not as a second-class alternative operating under the automobile’s giant shadow.

Without knowledge of virus viability, infection risk analyses lack accuracy. This pilot study was performed to (i) determine whether infectious (viable) respiratory viruses in aerosols could be collected from air in a real world environment by the viable virus aerosol sampler (VIVAS), (ii) compare and contrast the efficacy of the standard bioaerosol sampler, the BioSampler, with that of the VIVAS for the collection of airborne viruses in a real world environment, and (iii) gain insights for the use of the VIVAS for respiratory virus sampling. The VIVAS operates via a water vapor condensation process to enlarge aerosolized virus particles to facilitate their capture. A variety of viable human respiratory viruses, including influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses, were collected by the VIVAS located at least 2 m from seated patients, during a late-onset 2016 influenza virus outbreak. Whereas the BioSampler when operated following our optimized parameters also collected virus aerosols, it was nevertheless overall less successful based on a lower frequency of virus isolation in most cases. This side-by-side comparison highlights some limitations of past studies based on impingement-based sampling, which may have generated false-negative results due to either poor collection efficiency and/or virus inactivation due to the collection process. IMPORTANCE The significance of virus aerosols in the natural transmission of respiratory diseases has been a contentious issue, primarily because it is difficult to collect or sample virus aerosols using currently available air sampling devices. We tested a new air sampler based on water vapor condensation for efficient sampling of viable airborne respiratory viruses in a student health care center as a model of a real world environment. The new sampler outperformed the industry standard device (the SKC BioSampler) in the collection of natural virus aerosols and in maintaining virus viability. These results using the VIVAS indicate that respiratory virus aerosols are more prevalent and potentially pose a greater inhalation biohazard than previously thought. The VIVAS thus appears to be a useful apparatus for microbiology air quality tests related to the detection of viable airborne viruses.","Pan, Maohua; Bonny, Tania S.; Loeb, Julia; Jiang, Xiao; Lednicky, John A.; Eiguren-Fernandez, Arantzazu; Hering, Susanne; Fan, Z.

So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were <10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI. However, further study and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Shun-Chung; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Antimicrob Agents,432,16

We characterized and compared COVID-19 coverage in newspapers, television, and social media, and discussed implications for public health communication strategies that are relevant to an initial pandemic response. We conducted a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised topic modelling technique, analysis of 3,271 newspaper articles, 40 cable news shows transcripts, 96,000 Twitter posts, and 1,000 Reddit posts during March 4 - 12, 2020, a period chronologically early in the timeframe of the COVID-19 pandemic. Coverage of COVID-19 clustered on topics such as epidemic, politics, and the economy, and these varied across media sources. Topics dominating news were not predominantly health-related, suggesting a limited presence of public health in news coverage in traditional and social media. Examples of misinformation were identified particularly in social media. Public health entities should utilize communication specialists to create engaging informational content to be shared on social media sites. Public health officials should be attuned to their target audience to anticipate and prevent spread of common myths likely to exist within a population. This will help control misinformation in early stages of pandemics.","Chipidza, W.; Akbaripourdibazar, E.; Gwanzura, T.; Gatto, N. M.",,432,14

However, coverage remains variable. In this mini-review we update findings from a 2015 systematic review to describe results from recent studies in high income countries on the uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccination in pregnancy, reasons for vaccine hesitancy and barriers to increasing uptake, from maternal and healthcare provider (HCP) perspectives. Studies reported highly variable uptake (from 0% to 78%). A main facilitator for uptake among pregnant women was receiving a recommendation from their HCP. However, studies showed that HCP awareness of guidelines did not consistently translate into them recommending vaccines to pregnant women. Safety concerns are a well-established barrier to uptake/coverage of maternal immunization; 7%-52% of unvaccinated women gave safety concerns as a reason but these were also present in vaccinated women. Knowledge/awareness gaps among pregnant women and lack of confidence among HCPs to discuss vaccination were both important barriers. Several studies indicated that midwives were more likely to express safety concerns than other HCPs, and less likely to recommend vaccination to pregnant women. Women who perceived the risk of infection to be low were less likely to accept vaccination in several studies, along with women with prior vaccine refusal. Findings highlight the importance of further research to explore context-specific barriers to vaccination in pregnancy, which may include lack of vaccine confidence among pregnant woman and HCPs, and policy and structural factors.","Qiu, Xiao; Bailey, Heather; Thorne, Claire",Front Immunol,432,16

Here, we describe a high-throughput approach – Concept-Wide Association Study (ConceptWAS) that systematically scans a disease’s clinical manifestations from clinical notes. We used this method to identify symptoms specific to COVID-19 early in the course of the pandemic. METHODS: Using the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) EHR, we parsed clinical notes through a natural language processing pipeline to extract clinical concepts. We examined the difference in concepts derived from the notes of COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients on the PCR testing date. We performed ConceptWAS using the cumulative data every two weeks for early identifying specific COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: We processed 87,753 notes 19,692 patients (1,483 COVID-19-positive) subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing between March 8, 2020, and May 27, 2020. We found 68 clinical concepts significantly associated with COVID-19. We identified symptoms associated with increasing risk of COVID-19, including “absent sense of smell” (odds ratio [OR] = 4.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.21–7.50), “fever” (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.28–1.59), “with cough fever” (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.75–2.96), and “ageusia” (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 3.02–8.58). Using ConceptWAS, we were able to detect loss sense of smell or taste three weeks prior to their inclusion as symptoms of the disease by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CONCLUSION: ConceptWAS is a high-throughput approach for exploring specific symptoms of a disease like COVID-19, with a promise for enabling EHR-powered early disease manifestations identification.","Zhao, Juan; Grabowska, Monika E; Kerchberger, Vern Eric; Smith, Joshua C.; Eken, H.

Death from COVID-19 was ascertained from participant linkage to a UK-wide national registry. RESULTS: Between April 1(st) and September 23(rd) 2020, there were 388 deaths (138 women) ascribed to COVID-19 in the 494,932 individuals (269,602 women) with a reaction time test result, and 125 such deaths (38 women) in the 180,198 (97,794 women) for whom there were data on verbal-numeric reasoning. In analyses adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity, a one standard deviation (118.2 msec) slower reaction time was related to a higher rate of death from COVID-19 (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval: 1.18; 1.09, 1.28). A one standard deviation disadvantage (2.16 point) on the verbal-numeric reasoning test was also associated with an elevated risk of death (1.32; 1.09, 1.59). Attenuation after adjustment for additional covariates followed a similar pattern for both measures of cognition. For verbal-numeric reasoning, for instance, the hazard ratios were 1.22 (0.98, 1.51) after control for socioeconomic status, 1.16 (0.96, 1.41) after lifestyle factors, 1.25 (1.04, 1.52) after co-morbidity, and 1.29 (1.01, 1.64) after physiological indices. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, poorer performance on two pre-pandemic indicators of cognitive function, including reaction time, a knowledge-reduced measure, was related to death ascribed to COVID-19.","Batty, G.

Glycolytic metabolism has been identified as a determinant of susceptibility to HIV‐1 infection, but its role in the development and maintenance of HIV‐1 latency has not been elucidated. By combining transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, we here show that transition to latent HIV‐1 infection downregulates glycolysis, while viral reactivation by conventional stimuli reverts this effect. Decreased glycolytic output in latently infected cells is associated with downregulation of NAD(+)/NADH. Consequently, infected cells rely on the parallel pentose phosphate pathway and its main product, NADPH, fueling antioxidant pathways maintaining HIV‐1 latency. Of note, blocking NADPH downstream effectors, thioredoxin and glutathione, favors HIV‐1 reactivation from latency in lymphoid and myeloid cellular models. This provides a “shock and kill effect” decreasing proviral DNA in cells from people living with HIV/AIDS. Overall, our data show that downmodulation of glycolysis is a metabolic signature of HIV‐1 latency that can be exploited to target latently infected cells with eradication strategies.","Shytaj, Iart Luca; Procopio, Francesco Andrea; Tarek, Mohammad; Carlon‐Andres, Irene; Tang, Hsin‐Yao; Goldman, Aaron R; Munshi, MohamedHusen; Kumar Pal, Virender; Forcato, Mattia; Sreeram, Sheetal; Leskov, Konstantin; Ye, Fengchun; Lucic, Bojana; Cruz, Nicolly; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C; Bicciato, Silvio; Padilla‐Parra, Sergi; Diaz, Ricardo Sobhie; Singh, Amit; Lusic, Marina; Karn, Jonathan; Alvarez‐Carbonell, David; Savarino, Andrea",EMBO Mol Med,432,2

This is a challenge for the society as regular psychological services cannot be offered to the same extent as before the pandemic. In addition to the requirement of social distancing, there is a need to adjust psychological treatment components like exposure to avoid increasing the spread of the infection. Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has an established evidence base for a range of psychiatric problems and has been suggested as one possible approach to deal with the situation. This study aimed to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial during the summer of 2020 with a broad focus on psychological distress and a treatment approach that tailors the intervention based on symptom profile and preferences. Methods: Following the advertisement and interview, we included 52 participants with elevated levels of psychological distress. They were randomly allocated to either a 7-week-long individually tailored ICBT (n = 26) or a wait-list control condition (n = 26). Measures of depression and quality of life were used as primary outcomes. We also included secondary outcome measures of anxiety, insomnia, trauma, stress, anger, and alcohol use. For screening, we used the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS). Results: Overall moderate to large between-group effects were found at post-treatment in favor of the treatment on measures of both depression [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Cohens d = 0.63; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): d = 0.62] and anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item scale (GAD-7); d = 0.82]. This was also observed for stress symptoms [Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14); d = 1.04]. No effects were seen on measures of quality of life, insomnia, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and anger. There was an effect on alcohol use [Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT); d = 0.54], which was not of clinical relevance. Conclusion: Individually tailored ICBT shows initial promise as a way to reduce psychological problems in association with the COVID-19 pandemic. A possible limitation was that the trial was conducted when the effects of the pandemic were decreasing and when fewer people were affected by the restrictions (e.g., the summer of 2020).","Aminoff, Victoria; Sellén, Malin; Sörliden, Elise; Ludvigsson, Mikael; Berg, Matilda; Andersson, Gerhard",Front Psychol,432,1

The preferential targeting of serotonin receptor (SERT) by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has offered an opportunity to reduce the range of these side effects and improve patient adherence to pharmacotherapy. Clozapine remains an effective drug against treatment-resistant schizophrenia, defined as failing treatment with at least two different antipsychotic medications. Patients with schizophrenia who display a constellation of negative symptoms respond poorly to antipsychotic monotherapy. Negative symptoms include the diminution of motivation, interest, or expression. Conversely to the depressive symptomology of interest presently, supplementation of antipsychotics with SSRIs in schizophrenic patients with negative symptoms lead to synergistic improvements in the function of these patients. Fluvoxamine is one of the most potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 and can lead to an increase in clozapine levels. Similar increases in serum clozapine were detected in two patients taking sertraline. However, studies have been contradictory as well, showing no such increases, which are worrying. Clinicians should be aware that clozapine levels should be monitored with any coadministration with SSRIs.","Edinoff, Amber N.; Fort, Juliana M.; Woo, Joshua J.; Causey, Christopher D.; Burroughs, Caroline R.; Cornett, Elyse M.; Kaye, Adam M.; Kaye, Alan D.",Neurol Int,432,16

Subsequently, because of passive antibody transfer, the offspring of these primed gilts were more efficient in surviving a lethal TGEV challenge. An average survival rate of 89% occurred in 6 litters of piglets from primed gilts that were boosted with 2.8×10(6) plaque forming units (PFU) of TGEV whereas 76% of the piglets survived in three litters that suckled primed gilts boosted with 3.0×10(5) PFU of TGEV. Non-primed gilts given identical pre-farrowing doses of TGEV had litter survival rates of 63 and 55%, respectively. Moreover, both groups of litters from primed gilts suffered less clinical illness (as measured by the extent of weight loss post-challenge) than control litters. Priming of the piglets as neonates and boosting the pregnant gilts produced an anamnestic systemic immune response and correspondingly higher milk titers in the primed gilts compared to control animals. Thus, priming piglets with PRCV was beneficial in providing resistance to TGEV and could be incorporated into a vaccine strategy that yields better protection against TGEV.","Wesley, Ronald D.; Lager, Kelly M.",Vet Microbiol,432,21

In addition to the lung, cytokine storm-induced inflammatory cascade also affects other organs. SARS-CoV-2 infection-related vascular inflammation is characterized by endotheliopathy in the lung and other organs. Whether SARS-CoV-2 causes endotheliopathy by directly infecting endothelial cells is not known and is the focus of the present study. We observed 1) the co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 with the endothelial cell marker CD31 in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice expressing hACE2 in the lung by intranasal delivery of adenovirus 5-hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2 mice) and non-human primates at both the protein and RNA levels, and 2) SARS-CoV-2 proteins in endothelial cells by immunogold labeling and electron microscopic analysis. We also detected the co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 with CD31 in autopsied lung tissue obtained from patients who died from severe COVID-19. Comparative analysis of RNA sequencing data of the lungs of infected Ad5-hACE2 and Ad5-empty (control) mice revealed upregulated KRAS signaling pathway, a well-known pathway for cellular activation and dysfunction. Further, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects mature mouse aortic endothelial cells (AoECs) that were activated by performing an aortic sprouting assay prior to exposure to SARS-CoV-2. This was demonstrated by co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 and CD34 by immunostaining and detection of viral particles in electron microscopic studies. Moreover, the activated AoECs became positive for ACE-2 but not quiescent AoECs. Together, our results indicate that in addition to pneumocytes, SARS-CoV-2 also directly infects mature vascular endothelial cells in vivo and ex vivo, which may contribute to cardiovascular complications in SARS-CoV-2 infection, including multipleorgan failure.","Liu, Fengming; Han, Kun; Blair, Robert; Kenst, Kornelia; Qin, Zhongnan; Upcin, Berin; Wörsdörfer, Philipp; Midkiff, Cecily C.; Mudd, Joseph; Belyaeva, Elizaveta; Milligan, Nicholas S.; Rorison, Tyler D.; Wagner, Nicole; Bodem, Jochen; Dölken, Lars; Aktas, Bertal H.; Vander Heide, Richard S.; Yin, Xiao-Ming; Kolls, Jay K.; Roy, Chad J.; Rappaport, Jay; Ergün, Süleyman; Qin, Xuebin",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,432,32

Recently, HRV-C was identified as a new species of HRV, but its spectrum of clinical disease is not well understood. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the molecular epidemiology, demographic and clinical characteristics of HRVs among hospitalized children with ALRIs. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and sixty-five nasopharangeal aspirates taken from children <5 years hospitalized with ALRTIs in Serdang Hospital, Malaysia, were subject to reverse transcriptase-PCR for HRV. Phylogenetic analysis on VP4/VP2 and 5′-NCR regions was used to further characterize HRV. Other respiratory viruses were also investigated using semi-nested multiplex RT-PCR assay. Clinical parameters were analyzed between HRV, RSV and IFV-A mono-infections and between HRV species. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 54 (33%) patients for both single (36 samples) and multiple (18 samples) infections, 61.1% (22/36) represents HRV-A strains while the remaining 14 HRV-C. Strain P51was the first reported representative of HRV98. The majority of the single HRV cases were in the second half of infancy; HRV-C occurred among older children compared with HRV-A. HRV children were admitted significantly earlier and less febrile than RSV and IFV-A infection. HRV-C infected children were more likely to have rhonchi and vomiting as compared to HRV-A. Pneumonia was the most common discharge diagnosis followed by bronchiolitis and post-viral wheeze in HRV patients. CONCLUSION: Our study showed high prevalence of HRVs and detection of HRV-C among hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Malaysia.

The Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial to mediate viral entry into host cells; however, whether it can be cellularly pathogenic and contribute to pulmonary hyper-inflammations in COVID-19 is not well known. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we developed a Spike protein-pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus with the proper tropism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on the surface and tracked down the fate of Spp in wild type C57BL/6J mice receiving intravenous injection of the virus. A lentivirus with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was used as the control. Two hours post-infection (hpi), Spp showed more than 27–75 times more viral burden in the lungs than other organs; it also exhibited about 3–5 times more viral burden than VSV-G lentivirus in the lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. Acute pneumonia was evident in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in LDLR(+) macrophages and pneumocytes in the lungs, but not in MARC1(+) macrophages. IL6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR-γ were quickly upregulated in response to infection of Spp lentivirus in the lungs in vivo as well as in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We further confirmed that forced expression of the Spike protein in RAW264.7 cells could significantly increase the mRNA levels of the same panel of inflammatory factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone can induce cellular pathology, e.g. activating macrophages and contributing to induction of acute inflammatory responses.","Cao, Xiaoling; Tian, Yan; Nguyen, Vi; Zhang, Yuping; Gao, Chao; Yin, Rong; Carver, Wayne; Fan, Daping; Albrecht, Helmut; Cui, Taixing; Tan, Wenbin",bioRxiv,432,16

We describe a case of COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in an adult (MIS-A), similar to that described in children (MIS-C), which may have been set off by an unrelated secondary infection. CASE: A 27-year-old male patient presented with acute epididymitis secondary to acute Chlamydia infection that progressed to multisystem inflammatory failure with respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, cardiogenic shock with heart failure, and gastrointestinal and renal dysfunction. He tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab thrice within 4 days of presentation, but positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G antibody signifying remote infection. The patient was treated with tocilizumab and steroids, along with doxycycline for concurrent Chlamydia infection, resulting in dramatic improvement in all organ function. We suspect that C. trachomatis infection in this instance may have triggered an aberrant immune response that was shaped by prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: We present a case of an adult patient with acute Chlamydia trachomatis infection occurring in the wake of asymptomatic (or at least unrecognized) COVID-19 resulting in MIS-A. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of other such unusual reactions occurring in the aftermath of COVID-19. This case also highlights the importance for clinicians who care for adult patients of being familiar with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children, as an identical syndrome may occur in adult patients.","Chandnani, Madhuri; Charini, William A.; Jha, Anil; Dodhia, Chetan; Haddad, Eduardo",Case Rep Infect Dis,432,9

METHODS: User data from a risk assessment company were collected from February 2 to April 11, 2020. The use of risk assessment was used as a proxy for the use of 3 breast cancer services, namely, breast imaging, breast surgery, and genetics consultation. Changes in the use of these services during the study period were analyzed. RESULTS: All 3 services experienced significant declines after the COVID‐19 outbreak. The decline in breast surgery began during the week of March 8, followed by breast imaging and genetics consultation (both of which began during the week of March 15). Breast imaging experienced the most significant reduction, with an average weekly decline of 61.7% and a maximum decline of 94.6%. Breast surgery demonstrated an average weekly decline of 20.5%. When surgical consultation was stratified as breast cancer versus no breast cancer, the decrease among in non–breast cancer patients was more significant than that of patients with breast cancer (a decline of 66.8% vs 11.5% from the pre‐COVID average weekly volume for non–breast cancer patients and patients with breast cancer, respectively). During the week of April 5, use of genetics consultations dropped to 39.9% of the average weekly volumes before COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19 has had a significant impact on the number of patients undergoing breast cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment.","Yin, Kanhua; Singh, Preeti; Drohan, Brian; Hughes, Kevin S.",Cancer,432,16

Differences in SGLT2 over SGLT1 selectivity of the available agents have been proposed to relate to variability in efficacy and safety characteristics. In contrast to other SGLT2 inhibitors, the cardiorenal effects of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes had not been explored until recently, when the results of SOLOIST-WHF (focusing on heart failure [HF] outcomes) and SCORED (focusing on renal outcomes) were published. In SOLOIST-WHF, sotagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular (CV) death and hospitalizations and urgent visits for HF. The findings showed that the risk reduction was consistent in people with reduced but also in those with preserved ejection fraction (EF). In SCORED, sotagliflozin significantly reduced the primary end point of CV deaths, hospitalizations for HF, and urgent visits for HF. A reduction in glycated hemoglobin was evident even in participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate values below 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). SCORED is also the first trial to illustrate the benefits of the class across the full range of albuminuria. Moreover, the endpoint of stroke was significantly reduced by 34% in the sotagliflozin compared with the placebo group. The findings of the two studies provide novel insights into the clinical utility of SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly with respect to the early initiation in stable HF, the benefits in HF with preserved EF, the glucose-lowering efficacy in people with severe renal impairment and their potential to improve atherosclerotic vascular disease, including stroke, outcomes.","Koufakis, Theocharis; Mustafa, Omar G.; Tsimihodimos, Vasilios; Ajjan, Ramzi A.; Kotsa, Kalliopi",Drugs,432,1

Animal factors such as the number of immunologically protected individuals influence the number of individuals that a potential pathogen is able to infect, as well as the speed of spread through a population. Pathogens differ in their virulence and contagiousness. In addition, pathogens have various methods of transmission that impact how they interact with a host population. A cattle population's environment includes its housing type, animal density, air quality, and exposure to mud or dust and other health antagonists such as parasites and stress; these environmental factors influence the innate immunity of a herd by their impact on immunosuppression. In addition, a herd's environment also dictates the “animal flow” or contact and mixing patterns of potentially infectious and susceptible animals. Biosecurity is the attempt to keep infectious agents away from a herd, state, or country, and to control the spread of infectious agents within a herd. Infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, or parasites) alone are seldom able to cause disease in cattle without contributing factors from other infectious agents and/or the cattle's environment. Therefore to develop biosecurity plans for infectious disease in cattle, veterinarians must consider the pathogen, as well as environmental and animal factors.","Larson, R.L.",Theriogenology,432,24

The strategy for phase 2 should be more complex and interdisciplinary than described in the paper in Nature, especially in the period before a vaccine and specific treatments are available. The focus on reducing the mortality of COVID-19 will have side effects, including excess mortality from other causes. A part of this excess mortality will be based on the reduction of health-care offers as a consequence of the pandemic, and on structural limitations of the health-care system. A special challenge is to understand the relationship between death from and death with COVID-19, and therefore the relevance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in people with pre-existing burdens, for example coronary heart disease, cancer or older age.

During 2015–2016, a total of 104 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from puppies and adult dogs, with or without hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts (KNA). By PCR, 25 (24%, n = 104) samples tested positive for CPV. Based on analysis of the complete deduced VP2 amino acid sequences, 20 of the KNA CPV strains were assigned to new CPV-2a (also designated as CPV-2a-297A). On the other hand, the VP2 genes of the remaining 5 strains were partially characterized, or could not be sequenced. New CPV-2a was the predominant CPV variant in St. Kitts, contrasting the molecular epidemiology of CPV variants reported in most studies from nearby North and South American countries. By RT-PCR, CCoVs were detected in 5 samples (4.8%, n = 104). Based on analysis of partial M-protein gene, the KNA CCoV strains were assigned to CCoV-I genotype, and were closely related to CCoV-I strains from Brazil. To our knowledge, this is the first report on detection and genetic diversity of CPV and CCoV in dogs from the Caribbean region, and underscores the importance of similar studies in the other Caribbean islands.","Navarro, Ryan; Nair, Rajeev; Peda, Andrea; Aung, Meiji Soe; Ashwinie, GS; Gallagher, Christa A; Malik, Yashpal S; Kobayashi, Nobumichi; Ghosh, Souvik",Virus Res,432,16

The aim of our work was to better understand the impact of misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 on epidemic curves. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 28 May 2020). There is presently no information of sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of laboratory tests used in Canada for the causal agent for COVID-19. Therefore, we examined best attainable performance in other jurisdictions and similar viruses. This suggested perfect Sp and Sn 60–95%. We used these values to re-calculate epidemic curves to visualize the potential bias due to imperfect testing. If the sensitivity improved, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60–70% range. These issues are minor early in the epidemic, but hundreds of undiagnosed cases are likely later on. It is therefore hazardous to judge progress of the epidemic based on observed epidemic curves unless quality of testing is better understood.

Though a specific etiologic agent is not constantly identified, to evaluate carefully patient's clinical history and obtain adequate samples for the search of a potential ADEM causal agent is crucial. In the case of a prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment, most children with ADEM have a favorable outcome with full recovery, but in the case of diagnostic delays or inappropriate treatment some patients might display neurological sequelae and persistent deficits or even show an evolution to multiple sclerosis. The suspicion of ADEM rises on a clinical basis and derives from systemic and neurologic signs combined with magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system. Other advanced imaging techniques may help an appropriate differential diagnosis and definition of exact disease extension. Although there is no standardized protocol or management for ADEM, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis have been successfully used. There is no marker that permits to identify the subset of children with worse prognosis and future studies should try to detect any biological clue for prevision of neurologic damage as well as should optimize treatment strategies using an approach based on the effective risk of negative evolution.","Esposito, Susanna; Di Pietro, Giada Maria; Madini, Barbara; Mastrolia, Maria Vincenza; Rigante, Donato",Autoimmun Rev,432,16

Adolescent avoidant coping style moderated this effect of parent internalizing symptoms on adolescent internalizing symptoms in the subsequent month, such that parent internalizing symptoms predicted child internalizing symptoms only among adolescents with moderate to high rates of avoidant coping. Follow-up analyses indicated different patterns when examining depressive and anxiety symptoms separately.

This is often not true for diagnostic tests, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Here, we develop Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for Imperfect Tests (LQAS-IMP) to address this issue and apply it to a COVID-19 serosurveillance study in Haiti. Development: As part of the standard LQAS procedure, the user specifies allowable classification errors for the system, which is defined by a sample size and decision rule. We show that when an imperfect diagnostic test is used, the classification errors are larger than specified. We derive a modified procedure, LQAS-IMP, that accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test to yield correct classification errors. Application: At Zanmi Lasante health facilities in Haiti, the goal was to assess the prior circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) using a limited number of antibody tests. As the COVID-19 antibody tests were known to have imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we used the LQAS-IMP procedure to define valid systems for sampling at eleven hospitals in Haiti. Conclusions: The LQAS-IMP procedure accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity in system design; if the accuracy of a test is known, the use of LQAS-IMP extends LQAS to applications for indicators that are based on laboratory tests, such as COVID-19 antibodies.","Fulcher, I.

This manuscript applies a specific case study method to describe the impact of the longitudinal interplay between implementation stakeholders. Growing out of science and technology studies (STS) and drawing on the latent archaeological sensibilities implied by ethnographic methods, the STS case-study is a tool for implementors to use when a piece of material culture is an essential component of an innovation. METHODS: We conducted an ethnographic process evaluation of the clinical implementation of tele-critical care (Tele-CC) services in the Department of Veterans Affairs. We collected fieldnotes and conducted participant observation at virtual and in-person education and planning events (n = 101 h). At Go-Live and 6-months post-implementation, we conducted site visits to the Tele-CC hub and 3 partnered ICUs. We led semi-structured interviews with ICU staff at Go-Live (43 interviews with 65 participants) and with ICU and Tele-CC staff 6-months post-implementation (44 interviews with 67 participants). We used verification strategies, including methodological coherence, appropriate sampling, collecting and analyzing data concurrently, and thinking theoretically, to ensure the reliability and validity of our data collection and analysis process. RESULTS: The STS case-study helped us realize that we must think differently about how a Tele-CC clinician could be noticed moving from communal to intimate space. To understand how perceptions of surveillance impacted staff acceptance, we mapped the materials through which surveillance came to matter in the stories staff told about cameras, buttons, chimes, motors, curtains, and doorbells. CONCLUSIONS: STS case-studies contribute to the literature on longitudinal qualitive research (LQR) in implementation science, including pen portraits and periodic reflections. Anchored by the material, the heterogeneity of an STS case-study generates questions and encourages exploring differences. Begun early enough, the STS case-study method, like periodic reflections, can serve to iteratively inform data collection for researchers and implementors. The next step is to determine systematically how material culture can reveal implementation barriers and direct attention to potential solutions that address tacit, deeply rooted challenges to innovations in practice and technology.

In 2018, Kettering General Hospital (KGH) was awarded £60 800 of government funds to create high-quality rest facilities and improve junior doctor well-being. METHODS: An audit and survey in KGH identified the structural and functional improvements needed. From November 2019 to June 2020, £47 841.24 was spent on creating new rest facilities. On completion, a postaction review assessed how the changes impacted morale, well-being and quality of patient care. RESULTS: The majority of doctors were happy with the new rest areas (60%), a majority felt that they would use the on-call room area (63%) and the renovation improved morale and well-being. There was an increased ability to take breaks. However, the majority of doctors are not exception-reporting missing breaks: 79% (2019), 74% (2020). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This report recommends the maintenance of increased staffing levels and rest facilities during the recovery phase of COVID-19. The remaining £12 958.76 should be directed at sustaining the quality of KGH rest facilities. Lastly, the rate of exception-reporting must be increased through improving awareness, exploring alternative methods and supporting the action when necessary.

In Brazil, this mitigation strategy was first implemented in March 2020 and mainly monitored by social isolation indicators built from mobile geolocation data. While it is well known that social isolation has been playing a crucial role in epidemic control, the precise connections between mobility data indicators and epidemic dynamic parameters have a complex interdependence. In this work, we investigate this dependence for several Brazilian cities, looking also at socioeconomic and demographic factors that influence it. As expected, the increase in the social isolation indicator was shown to be related to the decrease in the speed of transmission of the disease, but the relation was shown to depend on the urban hierarchy level of the city, the human development index and also the epidemic curve stage. Moreover, a high social isolation at the beginning of the epidemic relates to a strong positive impact on flattening the epidemic curve, while less efficacy of this mitigation strategy was observed when it has been implemented later. Mobility data plays an important role in epidemiological modeling and decision-making, however, we discuss in this work how a direct relationship between social isolation data and COVID-19 data is hard to be established. Understanding this interplay is a key factor to better modeling, for which we hope this study contributes.","Ferreira, C. P.; Marcondes, D.; Melo, M. P.; Oliva, s. M.; Peixoto, C.; Peixoto, P.

Among immune individuals, 21% had been asymptomatic. Anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) occurred in 52% of the IgG‐positive individuals and in 3% of the negative ones. In contrast, 30% of the anosmia‐ageusia cases were seronegative suggesting that the true prevalence of infection may have reached 16.6%. In sera obtained 4–8 weeks after the first sampling anti‐N and anti‐S IgG titers and neutralization activity in pseudo‐virus assay declined by 31%, 17% and 53%, resulting thus in half‐life of respectively 35, 87 and 28 days. The population studied is representative of active workers in Paris. The short lifespan of the serological systemic responses suggests an underestimation of the true prevalence of infection.

Here, we describe the dynamic interplay between IF3 domains and their alternative binding sites using pre-steady state kinetics combined with molecular modelling of available structures of initiation complexes. Our results show that IF3 accommodates its domains at velocities ranging over two orders of magnitude, responding to the binding of each 30S ligand. IF1 and IF2 promote IF3 compaction and the movement of the C-terminal domain (IF3C) towards the P site. Concomitantly, the N-terminal domain (IF3N) creates a pocket ready to accept the initiator tRNA. Selection of the initiator tRNA is accompanied by a transient accommodation of IF3N towards the 30S platform. Decoding of the mRNA start codon displaces IF3C away from the P site and rate limits translation initiation. 70S initiation complex formation brings IF3 domains in close proximity to each other prior to dissociation and recycling of the factor for a new round of translation initiation. Altogether, our results describe the kinetic spectrum of IF3 movements and highlight functional transitions of the factor that ensure accurate mRNA translation initiation.","Nakamoto, Jose A; Evangelista, Wilfredo; Vinogradova, Daria S; Konevega, Andrey L; Spurio, Roberto; Fabbretti, Attilio; Milón, Pohl",Nucleic Acids Res,432,16

However, vaccines for containing new cases of COVID-19 are yet to be realized. Also, presently available antiviral drugs and other standard of care (SOC) management strategies could not satisfactorily control COVID-19-related mortality, which has crossed the one million mark during the last 9 months. These facts present an emergent need for developing new, novel, and evolving therapeutic strategies for the management of COVID-19. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This cohort study represents a clinical trial in real-life situations in Bangladesh where two immune modulators were applied in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 199 confirmed patients of COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. All of them had severe and critical COVID-19 and they were hospitalized at the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Dhaka, Bangladesh. All patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the nasal swab and they were endowed with severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunctions, and coagulopathy. The median percentage of lung involvement was 65%. The mean oxygen saturation was 83%. The patients received two immune modulators (tocilizumab and bevacizumab) in different combinations to retrieve broader insights about the safety and efficacy of immune modulators in COVID-19 management. RESULTS: Out of the total 199 patients, 122 survived and 77 expired. A single dose of tocilizumab resulted in the survival of 71.5% (73 of 102 COVID-19 patients). On the other hand, a dramatic survival benefit was found in patients receiving bevacizumab (92%). CONCLUSION: The study indicates that active treatment should be started as early as possible for COVID-19 patients as moderate COVID-patients may progress to more severe illnesses with grave consequences. The safety of two immune modulators has been recorded in this cohort of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. In order to have a proper use of these immune modulators, there is a need to accomplish controlled, blinded, and large-scale prospective studies with at least two arms.

Due to transitional symmetry of a helix, weakly specific cooperative interaction between ssRNA and nucleocapsid proteins leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic assembly/packaging signals in the related genomic sequence. Such signals coordinated with the nucleocapsid helical structure were detected and reconstructed in the genomes of the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The main period of the signals for both viruses was about 54 nt, that implies 6.75 nt per N protein. The complete coverage of the ssRNA genome of length about 30,000 nt by the nucleocapsid would need 4.4 × 10(3) N proteins, that makes them the most abundant among the structural proteins. The repertoires of motifs for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were divergent but nearly coincided for different isolates of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained the distributions of assembly/packaging signals over the genomes with nonoverlapping windows of width 432 nt. Finally, using the spectral entropy, we compared the load from point mutations and indels during virus age for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We found the higher mutational load on SARS-CoV. In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 can be treated as a ‘newborn’ virus. These observations may be helpful in practical medical applications and are of basic interest. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We wished to estimate those trends. Methods: We examined all psychiatric visits to the emergency department (ED) during March, April 2020, compared to identical months in 2018, 2019. We evaluated both number and nature of referrals. Results: Throughout the years, psychiatric referrals comprised about 5% of the total number of ED visits. In March-April 2020, 30% decreases were observed in overall ED visits and in psychiatric referrals in the ED. Compared to 2018–2019, in 2020, the proportions of these diagnoses were higher: anxiety disorders (14.5 vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001), personality disorders (6.7 vs. 3.2%, p = 0.001), psychosis (9.5 vs. 6.7%, p = 0.049), post-traumatic stress disorder (3.2 vs. 1.5%, p = 0.023). Compared to 2018–2019, in 2020, proportions were lower for adjustment disorder (5.8 vs. 8.9%, p = 0.036) and for consultation regarding observation (11.7 vs. 31.6%, p < 0.001). Differences were not observed between 2018-2019 and 2020 in the proportions of other diagnoses including suicide and self-harm disorders. Referrals concerning suicide and self-harm in a rural hospital and community clinic were 30% lower in the COVID-19 lockdown than in the same months in 2018, 2019. Conclusion: Psychiatric ED visits decreased by the same proportion as overall visits to the ED, apparently driven by fears of COVID-19. Referrals relating suicidality and self-harm shown nominal decrease, but their proportioned share remained constant. Increased anxiety and delayed care may eventually lead to increased mental health needs.","Pikkel Igal, Yael; Meretyk, Irit; Darawshe, Aziz; Hayek, Samer; Givon, Limor; Levy, Avi; Sipori, Idan; Nuriel, Yonatan; Bloch, Boaz; Buniak, Shraga; Eshel, Ron; Fruchter, Eyal",Front Psychiatry,432,20

OBJECTIVE: With this study we aimed to shed new light on the pathogenesis of these two SARS-CoV-2-related clinical manifestations. METHODS: We investigated lymphocyte and dendritic cells subsets, chemokine/cytokine profiles and evaluated the neutrophil activity mediators, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in 10 children with COVID-19 and 9 with MIS-C at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Patients with MIS-C showed higher plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), MPO, IL-6, and of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2 than COVID-19 children. In addition, they displayed higher levels of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, mainly induced by IFN-γ. By contrast, we detected IFN-α in plasma of children with COVID-19, but not in patients with MIS-C. This observation was consistent with the increase of ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNAs in cells of COVID-19 patients, while ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNA were detected in MIS-C at levels comparable to healthy controls. Moreover, quantification of the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which constitute the main source of IFN-α, showed profound depletion of this subset in MIS-C, but not in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a pattern of immune response which is suggestive of type I interferon activation in COVID-19 children, probably related to a recent interaction with the virus, while in MIS-C the immune response is characterized by elevation of the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL8 and of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXL10, which are markers of an active Th1 type immune response. We believe that these immunological events, together with neutrophil activation, might be crucial in inducing the multisystem and cardiovascular damage observed in MIS-C.","Caldarale, Francesca; Giacomelli, Mauro; Garrafa, Emirena; Tamassia, Nicola; Morreale, Alessia; Poli, Piercarlo; Timpano, Silviana; Baresi, Giulia; Zunica, Fiammetta; Cattalini, Marco; Moratto, Daniele; Chiarini, Marco; Cannizzo, Elvira Stefania; Marchetti, Giulia; Cassatella, Marco Antonio; Taddio, Andrea; Tommasini, Alberto; Badolato, Raffaele",Front Immunol,432,20

However, the precise underlying pathogenic mechanisms have not been elucidated. In the present study, the infectivity of RSV on N2a neuronal cells and the possible roles of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nucleolin (C23) during RSV infection were investigated. METHODS: We compared two experimental groups (infected and non-infected) and monitored the RSV viral titers in the culture supernatant by a viral plaque assay. We also inspected the morphology of the nucleus in infected N2a cells. We measured the level of RSV F protein and studied its co-localization with TLR4 and nucleolin using immunofluorescence assays and laser confocal microscopy. The potential interaction of RSV F protein with TLR4 and nucleolin was examined by coimmunoprecipitation. The expression changes of TLR4, nucleolin, TLR3 and TLR7 proteins in N2a cells and IL-6 and TNF-α in the culture supernatant were investigated by Western Blot analysis and ELISA assay. Changes in neuronal cell apoptosis status was examined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The results demonstrated prolific RSV infection of N2a cells, which triggered a decrease of NeuN protein expression, coinciding with an increase of nuclear lesions, F protein expression, RSV viral titers, and late apoptotic levels of N2a cells. RSV infection induced co-localization of RSV F protein with TLR4 and nucleolin, which could potentially lead to a direct interaction. Furthermore, it was found that TLR4 and nucleolin levels increased early after infection and decreased subsequently, whereas TLR3 and TLR7 expression increased throughout RSV infection. CONCLUSION: The RSV Long strain can prolifically infect N2a neuronal cells, modulating the expression of TLR4 and nucleolin, as well as TLR3, TLR7 and their downstream inflammatory factors, and inducing the co-localization of the RSV F protein with TLR4 and nucleolin.","Yuan, Xiaoling; Hu, Tao; He, Hanwen; Qiu, Huan; Wu, Xuan; Chen, Jingxian; Wang, Minmin; Chen, Cheng; Huang, Shenghai",J Biomed Sci,432,1

Although previous studies reported a lower rate of death in patients treated with heparin, the potential benefit of chronic oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between OAT with the risk of ARDS and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective Italian study including consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 22, 2020, at six Italian hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups according to the chronic assumption of oral anticoagulants. RESULTS: Overall, 427 patients were included; 87 patients (19%) were in the OAT group. Of them, 54 patients (13%) were on treatment with non-vitamin k oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and 33 (8%) with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). OAT patients were older and had a higher rate of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease compared to No-OAT group. The rate of ARDS at admission (26% vs 28%, P=0.834), or developed during the hospitalization (9% vs 10%, P=0.915), was similar between study groups; in-hospital mortality (22% vs 26%, P=0.395) was also comparable. After balancing for potential confounders by using the propensity score matching technique, no differences were found in term of clinical outcome between OAT and No-OAT patients CONCLUSION: Oral anticoagulation therapy, either NOACs or VKAs, did not influence the risk of ARDS or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Russo, Vincenzo; Bottino, Roberta; D’Andrea, Antonello; Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Golino, Paolo; Nigro, Gerardo; Valsecchi, Orazio; Attena, Emilio; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Galasso, Gennaro; Parodi, Guido; Scudiero, Fernando",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,432,6

We hypothesize that validated VTE risk scores would have prognostic ability in this population. Methods Retrospective observational cohort with severe COVID-19 performed in NorthShore University Health System. Patients were >18 years of age and met criteria for inpatient or intensive care unit (ICU) care. The International Medical Prevention Registry on Venous Thromboembolism (IMPROVE) and Caprini scores were calculated and patients were stratified. Results This study includes 184 patients, mostly men (63.6%), Caucasian (54.3%), 63 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 24–101), and 57.1% of them required ICU care. Twenty-seven (14.7%) thrombotic events occurred: 12 (6.5%) cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 9 (4.9%) of pulmonary embolism, 5 (2.7%) of deep vein thrombosis, and 1 (0.5%) stroke. Among them, 86 patients (46.7%) died, 95 (51.6%) were discharged, and 3 (1.6%) were still hospitalized. “Moderate risk for VTE” and “High risk for VTE” by IMPROVE score had significant mortality association: (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.93–11.03; p < 0.001) and (HR = 6.22; 95% CI: 3.04–12.71; p < 0.001), respectively, with 87% sensitivity and 63% specificity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.752, p < 0.001). “High Risk for VTE” by Caprini score had significant mortality association (HR = 17.6; 95% CI: 5.56–55.96; p < 0.001) with 96% sensitivity and 55% specificity (AUC = 0.843, p < 0.001). Both scores were associated with thrombotic events when classified as “High risk for VTE” by IMPROVE (HR = 6.50; 95% CI: 2.72–15.53; p < 0.001) and Caprini scores (HR = 11.507; 95% CI: 2.697–49.104; p = 0.001).

Because effective therapies are lacking, early identification and mitigation of risk factors is a pragmatic approach to improve outcomes. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the most pervasive risk factor for CLAD, but diagnosis requires transbronchial biopsy, which carries risks. We hypothesized that gene expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellet (CP) could replace biopsy and inform on mechanisms of CLAD. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on BAL CPs from 219 lung transplant recipients with A-grade ACR (n = 61), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (n = 58), infection (n = 41), or no rejection/infection (n = 59). Differential gene expression was based on absolute fold difference >2.0 and Benjamini-adjusted p-value ≤0.05. We used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resource for pathway analyses. For classifier modeling, samples were randomly split into training (n = 154) and testing sets (n = 65). A logistic regression model using recursive feature elimination and 5-fold cross-validation was trained to optimize area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Differential gene expression identified 72 genes. Enriched pathways included T-cell receptor signaling, natural killer cell–mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction. A 4-gene model (AUC = 0.72) and classification threshold defined in the training set exhibited fair performance in the testing set; accuracy was 76%, specificity 82%, and sensitivity 60%. In addition, classification as ACR was associated with worse CLAD-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.29–4.53). CONCLUSIONS: BAL CP gene expression during ACR is enriched for immune response pathways and shows promise as a diagnostic tool for ACR, especially ACR that is a precursor of CLAD.","Weigt, S.

Endothelial dysfunction is the main prognostic factor for the progression of vascular disorders, which responds to drug intervention and lifestyle changes. Virtually all of the drugs used to prevent cardiovascular disorders, such as long-used and new antilipidemic agents and inhibitors of angiotensin enzyme (ACEi), exert an important effect on the endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is a central feature of coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19), and it is now clear that life-risk complications of the disease are prompted by alterations of the endothelium induced by viral infection. As a consequence, the progression of COVID-19 is worse in the subjects in whom endothelial dysfunction is already present, such as elderly, diabetic, obese, and hypertensive patients. Importantly, circulating biomarkers of endothelial activation and injury predict the severity and mortality of the disease and can be used to evaluate the efficacy of treatments. The purpose of this review is to provide updates on endothelial function by discussing its clinical relevance in the cardiovascular continuum, the latest insights from molecular and cellular biology, and their implications for clinical practice, with a focus on new actors, such as the Notch signaling and emerging therapies for cardiovascular disease.","Fortini, Francesca; Vieceli Dalla Sega, Francesco; Marracino, Luisa; Severi, Paolo; Rapezzi, Claudio; Rizzo, Paola; Ferrari, Roberto",Biomedicines,432,28

Design Retrospective observational study Setting A specialist children's hospital in the UK Patients Inpatients aged 25 and younger treated at a specialist children's hospital between 29 April 2019 and 6 September 2020 Results There were 21,471 day cases and inpatients treated during the 16 month study period. Day cases (no overnight stay) dropped by around 37% per week. Both admissions and discharges for inpatients (at least one overnight stay) decreased leading to a small reduction in hospital bed days but no reduction in hospital bed nights. The effect on hospital activity on different patient groups varied substantially with some groups such as medical oncology day cases increasing by 13%. As a result, the patient case mix in the hospital was very different during the pandemic. Overall weekly medication administrations decreased for day cases and inpatients, but weekly medication administrations per bed day increased by 10% for day cases and 6% for inpatients. Conclusions Despite not being badly affected by the disease itself, specialist paediatric hospital services have been greatly affected by the pandemic. The average number of medications per inpatient bed day increased, likely reflecting changes to the patient population, with only those children with severe conditions being treated during the pandemic. These data demonstrate the complex pattern of implications on specialist services and provide evidence for planning the impact of future emergencies and resolution strategies.","Vestesson, E.; Alonso, C.; Booth, J.; Sebire, N.

The 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of this β-CoV contains essential cis-acting RNA elements for the viral genome transcription and replication. These elements include an equilibrium between an extended bulged stem-loop (BSL) and a pseudoknot. The existence of such an equilibrium is supported by reverse genetic studies and phylogenetic covariation analysis and is further proposed as a molecular switch essential for the control of the viral RNA polymerase binding. Here, we report the SARS-CoV-2 3′ UTR structures in cells that transcribe the viral UTRs harbored in a minigene plasmid and isolated infectious virions using a chemical probing technique, namely dimethyl sulfate (DMS)-mutational profiling with sequencing (MaPseq). Interestingly, the putative pseudoknotted conformation was not observed, indicating that its abundance in our systems is low in the absence of the viral nonstructural proteins (nsps). Similarly, our results also suggest that another functional cis-acting element, the three-helix junction, cannot stably form. The overall architectures of the viral 3′ UTRs in the infectious virions and the minigene-transfected cells are almost identical.","Zhao, Junxing; Qiu, Jianming; Aryal, Sadikshya; Hackett, Jennifer L.; Wang, Jingxin",Viruses,432,26

The worldwide spread of the disease has led to a public health quarantine where health care professionals are at high risk of infection. In this context, telemedicine has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission. This study aims to demonstrate that a combined framework based on telematics and in-person clinical encounter not only ensures medical care but the safety of healthcare professionals and patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive observational study on the follow-up of patients during the COVID19 Pandemic, combining telephone and traditional. RESULTS: A total of 5031 telephone calls were made, differentiating between medical referrals, specialized primary care visits, and outpatient consultation. They were classified as successful, required an in-person visit, or no successful telephone contact. Furthermore, we divided them into 2 groups: resolved and unresolved. 53% of all telematic visits were successful. CONCLUSIONS: Telematic medical systems are a feasible option in a orthopedics department and an interesting resource to preserve once the pandemic is resolved. Future lines of research should be opened to improve system success, analyze its cost-effectiveness ratio, and correct any legal conflicts that may exist.","Miguela Álvarez, S.M.; Bartra Ylla, A.; Salvador Carreño, J.; Castillón, P.; García Cardona, C.; Anglès Crespo, F.",Rev Esp Cir Ortop Traumatol,432,16

Using a mathematical model calibrated to data from King County Washington but generalizable across states, we simulated multiple scenarios with different vaccine efficacy profiles, vaccination rates, and case thresholds for triggering and relaxing partial lockdowns. We assumed that a contagious variant is currently present at low levels. In all scenarios, it rapidly becomes dominant by early summer. Low case thresholds for triggering partial lockdowns during current and future waves of infection strongly predict lower total numbers of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in 2021. However, in regions with relatively higher current seroprevalence, there is a predicted delay in onset of a subsequent surge in new variant infections. For all vaccine efficacy profiles, increasing vaccination rate lowers the total number of infections and deaths, as well as the total number of days under partial lockdown. Due to variable current estimates of emerging variant infectiousness, vaccine efficacy against these variants, vaccine refusal, and future adherence to masking and physical distancing, we project considerable uncertainty regarding the timing and intensity of subsequent waves of infection. Nevertheless, under all plausible scenarios, rapid vaccination and early implementation of partial lockdown are the two most critical variables to save the greatest number of lives.","Reeves, D.

In this study we analyzed plasma cytokines in COVID-19 patients and investigated their association with respiratory failure (RF) and treatment in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Hospitalized patients (n = 34) with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited into a prospective cohort study. Clinical data and blood samples were collected at inclusion and after 2–5 and 7–10 days. RF was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) < 40 kPa. Plasma cytokines were analyzed by a Human Cytokine 27-plex assay. COVID-19 patients with RF and/or treated in ICU showed overall increased systemic cytokine levels. Plasma IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1α levels were negatively correlated with P/F, whereas combinations of IL-6, IP-10, IL-1ra and MCP-1 showed the best association with RF in ROC analysis (AUC 0.79–0.80, p < 0.05). During hospitalization the decline was most significant for IP-10 (p < 0.001). Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were present in patients with severe COVID-19. IL-6 and MCP-1 were inversely correlated with P/F with the largest AUC in ROC analyses and should be further explored as biomarkers to identify patients at risk for severe RF and as targets for improved treatment strategies.","Jøntvedt Jørgensen, Marthe; Holter, Jan Cato; Christensen, Erik Egeland; Schjalm, Camilla; Tonby, Kristian; Pischke, Søren Erik; Jenum, Synne; Skeie, Linda G.; Nur, Sarah; Lind, Andreas; Opsand, Hanne; Enersen, Tone Burvald; Grøndahl, Ragnhild; Hermann, Anne; Dudman, Susanne; Muller, Fredrik; Ueland, Thor; Mollnes, Tom Eirik; Aukrust, Pål; Heggelund, Lars; Holten, Aleksander Rygh; Dyrhol-Riise, Anne Ma",Sci Rep,432,26

We aimed to analyze outcomes of lung cancer patients affected by COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital of a high-incidence region during the pandemic. Methods: We annotated 23 lung cancer patients consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution (HGUGM; Madrid, Spain) between March 4th, 2020 and May 12th, 2020. Only patients with a confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were included in the study. Results: All patients had at least 1 COVID-19 related symptom; cough (48%), shortness of breath (48%), fever (39%), and low-grade fever (30%) were the most common. Time from symptoms onset to first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR was 5.5 days (range 1–17), with 13% of cases needed from a 2nd PCR to confirm diagnosis. There was a high variability on thoracic imaging findings, with multilobar pneumonia as the most commonly found pattern (74%). Main lab test abnormalities were low lymphocytes count (87%), high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio -NLR- (78%), and elevated inflammatory markers: fibrinogen (91%), c-reactive protein -CRP- (87%), and D-dimer (70%). In our series, hospitalization rate was 74%, 39% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the case-fatality rate was 35% (8/23). 87% of patients received anti-viral treatment (87% hydroxychloroquine, 74% lopinavir/ritonavir, 13% azithromycin), 43% corticosteroids, 26% interferon-β, 4% tocilizumab, and 82% of hospitalized patients received anticoagulation. High-oxygen requirements were needed in 39% of patients, but only 1 pt was admitted for invasive MV and was discharged 42 days after admission. Multiple variables related to tumor status, clinical baseline conditions, and inflammation markers were associated with mortality but did not remain statistically significant in a multivariate model. In patients with lung cancer receiving systemic therapy (n = 242) incidence and mortality from COVID-19 were 4.5, and 2.1%, respectively, with no differences found by type of treatment. Conclusions: Lung cancer patients represent a vulnerable population for COVID-19, according to the high rate of hospitalization, onset of ARDS, and high mortality rate. Although larger series are needed, no differences in mortality were found by type of cancer treatment. Measures to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain key to protect lung cancer patients.","Calles, Antonio; Aparicio, María Inmaculada; Alva, Manuel; Bringas, Marianela; Gutierrez, Natalia; Soto, Javier; Arregui, Marta; Tirado, Victoria Clara; Álvarez, Enrique Luis; del Monte-Millán, María; Massarrah, Tatiana; Galera, Mar; Álvarez, Rosa; Martín, Miguel",Front Oncol,432,26

However, we know little about the practical relevance of these challenges for Research Ethics Committees (RECs). Methods: We conducted a qualitative survey across all 52 German RECs on the challenges and potential solutions with reviewing proposals for COVID-19 studies. We de-identified the answers and applied thematic text analysis for the extraction and synthesis of challenges and potential solutions that we grouped under established principles for clinical research ethics. Results: We received an overall response rate of 42%. The 22 responding RECs reported that they had assessed a total of 441 study proposals on COVID-19 until 21 April 2020. For the review of these proposals the RECs indicated a broad spectrum of challenges regarding i) social value (e.g. lack of coordination), ii) scientific validity (e.g. provisional study planning), iii) favourable risk-benefit ratio (e.g. difficult benefit assessment), iv) informed consent (e.g. strict isolation measures), v) independent review (e.g. lack of time), vi) fair selection of trial participants (e.g. inclusion of vulnerable groups), and vii) respect for study participants (e.g. data security). Mentioned solutions ranged from improved local/national coordination, over guidance on modified consent procedures, to priority setting across clinical studies. Conclusions: RECs are facing a broad spectrum of pressing challenges in reviewing COVID-19 studies. Some challenges for consent procedures are well known from research in intensive care settings but are further aggravated by infection measures. Other challenges such as reviewing several clinical studies at the same time that potentially compete for the recruitment of in-house COVID-19 patients are unique to the current situation. For some of the challenges the proposed solutions in our survey could relatively easy be translated into practice. Others need further conceptual and empirical research. Our findings together with the increasing body of literature on COVID-19 research ethics, and further stakeholder engagement should inform the development of hands-on guidance for researchers, funders, RECs, and further oversight bodies.","Faust, A.; Sierawska, A.; Krueger, K.; Wisgalla, A.; Hasford, J.; Strech, D.",,432,17

Nine hundred and ninety‐one patients were included, of that 336 patients (34%) received aspirin during their hospitalization and 655 ones (66%) did not. Comorbidities were more prevalent in the patients who were receiving aspirin. Results from the multivariate COX proportional model demonstrated a significant independent association between aspirin use and reduction in the risk of in‐hospital mortality (0.746 [0.560–0.994], p = 0.046). Aspirin use in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 is associated with a significant decrease in mortality rate.

Infertility in queens has been poorly studied. It may not come as a surprise as common domestic shorthair cats are well known for their excellent fertility. However, even in the latter, the infertility rate is around 20%. Only recently, published articles have analyzed the reproductive performances in different breeds, for example in UK, Sweden, France and Italy, and found similar figures. In cats, infertility may arise from many factors such as mismating, prolonged anestrus or silent heats, hormonal, nutritional, genetical or chromosomal causes. Also, infectious diseases, probably frequent in breeding facilities, include pathological agents that are well recognized as having a negative effect on pregnancy or other pathogens for which the involvement in fertility problems is unclear. However, analyzing the literature, it appears that the most prevalent causes of infertility in pedigree cats may well be, in females, uterine pathology (sub-clinical endometritis, cystic endometrial hyperplasia, or mucometra), and in males, teratospermia, which may be “permanent” and linked to reduced heterozygosity or “transient” in tomcats that present normal quantitative spermatogenic parameters. The influence of the breed is unknown. There is an urgent need to study the origin of infertility in purebred cats in order to improve the diagnosis and to develop treatments that may restore normal fertility in subfertile or infertile animals.","Fontbonne, Alain; Prochowska, Sylwia; Niewiadomska, Zuzanna",Theriogenology,432,10

Thus, there is a need of strong and sustainable global collaborative works especially in terms of new and existing data analysis and sharing which will join the dots of knowledge gap. Our present chemical-informatics based data analysis approach is an attempt of application of previous activity data of SARS-CoV main protease (Mpro) inhibitors to accelerate the search of present SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The study design was composed of three major aspects: (1) classification QSAR based data mining of diverse SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors, (2) identification of favourable and/or unfavourable molecular features/fingerprints/substructures regulating the Mpro inhibitory properties, (3) data mining based prediction to validate recently reported virtual hits from natural origin against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. Our Structural and physico-chemical interpretation (SPCI) analysis suggested that heterocyclic nucleus like diazole, furan and pyridine have clear positive contribution while, thiophen, thiazole and pyrimidine may exhibit negative contribution to the SARS-CoV Mpro inhibition. Several Monte Carlo optimization based QSAR models were developed and the best model was used for screening of some natural product hits from recent publications. The resulted active molecules were analysed further from the aspects of fragment analysis. This approach set a stage for fragment exploration and QSAR based screening of active molecules against putative SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. We believe the future in vitro and in vivo studies would provide more perspectives for anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.","Ghosh, Kalyan; Amin, Sk.Abdul; Gayen, Shovanlal; Jha, Tarun",J Mol Struct,432,5

The current online-based study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of dental students and professionals during the early days of lockdown in India from 2 April to 1 May 2020. METHODOLOGY: An online-based cross-sectional study was undertaken through WhatsApp messenger and e-mail groups among dental students and professionals. The KAP on COVID-19 was ascertained using an investigator designed and validated questionnaire. The results were stratified based on student vs professionals. The data were expressed as frequency and percentage analysed using the chi-square/Fishers exact test using IBM version 17. A probability value of <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 287 complete responses from the dental students and professionals were received. The results indicated that the knowledge of both dental students and professionals were good and that the attitude and practice were in accordance with good clinical practice. No significant differences were found within the domains of KAP scores among the dental students and practitioners indicating that the study participants were abreast with the recent advances.

Apart from antivirals and respiratory support, anticoagulants, corticoids and immunomodulators are increasingly being prescribed, especially for more severe cases. We describe the clinical outcome of a large cohort of patients preferentially treated with glucocorticoids and interleukin inhibitors. Methods Single center and retrospective case series. Adult patients admitted with COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency were included.Patients who died within 2 days after admission and those testing positive but asymptomatic were excluded. We defined two study periods: from March 3rd to March 31 st, 2020 (beginning of epidemic until peak of incidence) and April 1 st to May 7 th,2020 (second half of epidemic). The majority of patients received respiratory support,combinations of antimicrobials, anticoagulants, corticoids and interleukin inhibitors.Antivirals were preferentially given in the first period. The clinical outcome (death and ventilator dependency) of both periods was compared. Results From March 3 rd to May 7 th, 685 patients were included for analysis (58.4% males, mean age 68.9 years). Patients in the first period (n=408) were younger (66.6 vs 71.1 years, p=0.003),presented lower mean P a O 2/F i O2 ratio at admission (256.5 vs 270.4 mm Hg,p=0.0563), higher ferritin (1520 vs 1221 ng/ml, p=0.01), higher IL-6 (679 vs 194 pg/ml,p<0.0001) and similar D-dimer levels (3.59 vs 3.39 μg/mL, p=0.65) compared to the second period (n=277).

The NO(2) sensors based on traditional materials have limitations of high-temperature requirements, slow recovery, and performance degradation under harsh environmental conditions. These limitations of traditional materials are forcing the scientific community to discover future alternative NO(2) sensitive materials. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)) has emerged as a potential candidate for developing next-generation NO(2) gas sensors. MoS(2) has a large surface area for NO(2) molecules adsorption with controllable morphologies, facile integration with other materials and compatibility with internet of things (IoT) devices. The aim of this review is to provide a detailed overview of the fabrication of MoS(2) chemiresistance sensors in terms of devices (resistor and transistor), layer thickness, morphology control, defect tailoring, heterostructure, metal nanoparticle doping, and through light illumination. Moreover, the experimental and theoretical aspects used in designing MoS(2)-based NO(2) sensors are also discussed extensively. Finally, the review concludes the challenges and future perspectives to further enhance the gas-sensing performance of MoS(2). Understanding and addressing these issues are expected to yield the development of highly reliable and industry standard chemiresistance NO(2) gas sensors for environmental monitoring.

Quantifying the risk of coronavirus infection associated with workplace activities is an urgent need. METHODS: We assessed the association of worker characteristics, occupational roles and behaviors, and participation in procedures with the risk of endemic coronavirus infection among healthcare personnel who participated in the Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Trial (ResPECT), a cluster randomized trial to assess personal protective equipment to prevent respiratory infections and illness conducted from 2011 to 2016. RESULTS: Among 4,689 HCP-seasons, we detected coronavirus infection in 387 (8%). HCP who participated in an aerosol generation procedure (AGP) at least once during the viral respiratory season were 105% (95% CI 21%, 240%) more likely to be diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection. Younger individuals, those who saw pediatric patients and those with household members under the age of five were at increased risk of coronavirus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests the risk of HCP becoming infected with an endemic coronavirus increases approximately two-fold with exposures to AGP. Our findings may be relevant to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may differ from endemic coronaviruses in important ways.","Cummings, Derek A T; Radonovich, Lewis J; Gorse, Geoffrey J; Gaydos, Charlotte A; Bessesen, Mary T; Brown, Alexandria C; Gibert, Cynthia L; Hitchings, Matthew D T; Lessler, Justin; Nyquist, Ann-Christine; Rattigan, Susan M; Rodriguez-Barradas, Maria C; Price, Connie Savor; Reich, Nicholas G; Simberkoff, Michael S; Perl, Trish M",Clin Infect Dis,432,1

This inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was produced by sequential inactivation with formaldehyde followed by propiolactone. The various antibody responses and specific T cell responses to different viral antigens elicited in immunized animals were maintained for longer than 150 days. This comprehensive immune response could effectively protect vaccinated macaques by inhibiting viral replication in macaques and substantially alleviating immunopathological damage, and no clinical manifestation of immunopathogenicity was observed in immunized individuals during viral challenge.

Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19–related knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. RESULTS: In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents’ self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19–related knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19–related NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples’ income and access to basic services.","Harling, Guy; Gómez-Olivé, Francesc Xavier; Tlouyamma, Joseph; Mutevedzi, Tinofa; Kabudula, Chodziwadziwa Whiteson; Mahlako, Ruth; Singh, Urisha; Ohene-Kwofie, Daniel; Buckland, Rose; Ndagurwa, Pedzisai; Gareta, Dickman; Gunda, Resign; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Nxumalo, Siyabonga; Wong, Emily B; Kahn, Kathleen; Siedner, Mark J; Maimela, Eric; Tollman, Stephen; Collinson, Mark; Herbst, Kobus",JMIR Public Health Surveill,432,5

Disuse of chloroquine led to restoration of drug-sensitive parasite to some extent in certain countries. Ever since chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were touted as potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there has been a dramatic surge in demand for the drugs. Even in areas where chloroquine is proscribed, there has been an unexpected increase in demand and supply of the drug. This situation is quite worrying as the indiscriminate use of chloroquine may produce drug-resistant parasites which may impact negatively on the efficacy of amodiaquine due to cross-resistance. Amodiaquine is a partner drug in one of the ACTs and in some of the drugs used for intermittent preventive treatment. We herein discuss the consequences of the escalated use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19 on chemotherapy or chemoprevention of malaria and offer an advice. We speculate that parasite strains resistant to chloroquine will escalate due to the increased and indiscriminate use of the drug and consequently lead to cross-resistance with amodiaquine which is present in some drug schemes aforementioned. Under the circumstance, the anticipated hope of reverting to the use of the ‘resurrected chloroquine’ to manage malaria in future is likely to diminish. The use of chloroquine and its derivatives for the management of COVID-19 should be controlled.","Quashie, Neils Ben; Duah-Quashie, Nancy Odurowah",J Trop Pediatr,432,5

Among SARS-CoV-2-infections-associated neurological symptoms fatigue, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness and anosmia/ageusia are most frequent, but less frequent neurological deficits such as seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome or ataxia may also occur. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we present a case of a 62-year-old man who developed a subacute cerebellar syndrome with limb-, truncal- and gait ataxia and scanning speech 1 day after clinical resolution of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Apart from ataxia, there were no signs indicative of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome or Miller Fisher syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebellar atrophy. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cerebellum was excluded by normal cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and, most importantly, absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody production. Other causes of ataxia such as other viral infections, other autoimmune and/or paraneoplastic diseases or intoxication were ruled out. The neurological deficits improved rapidly after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory and clinical findings as well as the marked improvement after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy suggest a post-infectious, immune-mediated cause of ataxia. This report should make clinicians aware to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential cause of post-infectious neurological deficits with an atypical clinical presentation and to consider high-dose corticosteroid treatment in case that a post-infectious immune-mediated mechanism is assumed.","Werner, Jana; Reichen, Ina; Huber, Michael; Abela, Irene A.; Weller, Michael; Jelcic, Ilijas",BMC Infect Dis,432,16

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) sought to assess the impact of COVID-19 on fellows enrolled in hematology-oncology programs. Methods: In spring 2020, ASH and ASCO developed and administered a survey by e-mail to active hematology-oncology fellow members. Response formats used both a semi-Likert scale and open-ended text. Questions focused on fellow experiences and how changes in their programs have impacted their personal and professional lives across several domains. Multiple-choice responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and NVivo software was used for qualitative analysis of open-ended questions. Results: Respondent demographics are described in Table 1. Of 2,306 trainees, 620 (27%) responded to the survey. Most respondents continued patient care responsibilities during the pandemic (80%). Almost half of all trainees (47%) reported that they felt less productive than usual. Stress and/or anxiety about the current situation was the most cited factor affecting productivity in the overall cohort (Figure 1). One-third (33%) of respondents had volunteered or were assigned to clinical/non-clinical COVID-19-related efforts. Of the 90 visa holders in our cohort, 30% (N=27) reported experiencing issues with their visa/immigration status. Eight percent of respondents stated their career plans had changed due to COVID-19. Of those who said their plans had changed, 30 respondents were considering careers in academia pre-pandemic and 11 were considering private practice. However, only 14 respondents were considering academia post-pandemic while 19 were interested in private practice. Overall, most respondents had concerns about at least one of the following: salary reductions, availability of networking events, family well-being, mental health and obtaining a job (Figure 2). The prevalence of burnout increased from 22% (N=105) before the pandemic to 33% (N=161) during (p<.001). Of the respondents who did not report burnout before COVID-19, 22% noted new-onset burnout during the pandemic. New-onset burnout prevalence varied based on the type of work respondents performed: no COVID-related work (17%), COVID-related non-clinical work (26%), and COVID-related clinical work (34%) (p<0.01). The open-ended responses yielded several consistent themes. Clinical and educational constraints were enumerated: lost learning opportunities due to low patient volumes, unavailability of colleagues to discuss cases, and overall low perceived quality of virtual learning. Trainees also reported reduced motivation to complete work within a stipulated time frame due to lack of robust discussions in the virtual environment and technological challenges in navigating educational resources. Trainee research was also severely impacted as laboratories closed, experimental animal colonies were lost, and many research activities ceased. Respondents also expressed concern that cuts in research training initiatives and budgets would jeopardize faculty positions for graduating fellows and that funding for travel and conferences was suspended. Fellows' recommendations for ASH and ASCO included improved online education, virtual research training and networking opportunities, practical guidance on caring for immune-compromised patients during the pandemic, increased funding resources for trainees, mental health resources, and advocating on behalf of trainee visa holders. Conclusions: Hematology-oncology trainees reported their training experiences have been deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A majority of trainees are concerned about the negative impact on career opportunities, research funding, financial well-being, and mental health. Burnout increased during COVID-19, especially in trainees who were assigned to specific COVID-related efforts. Training programs and professional societies can support trainees by increasing trainee research funding, online networking and learning opportunities, mental health resources and, support for international trainees.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA over 1 year among 136 health care workers infected during the first COVID-19 wave and in a subgroup after booster vaccination approximately 1 year later. Furthermore, spike-protein-reactive memory T cells were quantified approximately 7 months after the infection and after booster vaccination. Thirty healthy individuals without history of COVID-19 who were routinely vaccinated served as controls. RESULTS: Levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM- and IgA-antibodies showed a rapid decay over time, whereas IgG-antibody levels decreased more slowly. Among individuals with history of COVID-19, booster vaccination induced very high IgG- and to a lesser degree IgA-antibodies. Antibody levels were significantly higher after booster vaccination than after recovery from COVID-19. After vaccination with a two-dose schedule, healthy control subjects developed similar antibody levels as compared to individuals with history of COVID-19 and booster vaccination. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell counts did not correlate with antibody levels. None of the study participants suffered from a reinfection. CONCLUSIONS: Booster vaccination induces high antibody levels in individuals with a history of COVID-19 that exceeds by far levels observed after recovery. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels of similar magnitude were achieved in healthy, COVID-19-naïve individuals after routine two-dose vaccination.

People are hailing health-care professionals as heroes, worthy of praise and gratitude. However, the pandemic has overburdened the health-care system. In this situation, the undergraduate medical students are being used as a crucial part of the health-care team in various ways. Involvement of medical undergraduates in situations of natural disaster is not new. In fact, a review of history of previous natural disasters reveals that this has been normal every time health systems have been overburdened. In the present situation of COVID 19, these students have a crucial role to play in helping frontline workers combat the crisis. Though the students would like to render their services, they are in a state of dilemma, as their roles are not defined clearly and their training to combat the pandemic is inadequate, as it was in previous outbreaks. This highlights a need to introduce module-based training for medical graduates to contribute effectively in combating future outbreaks.","Pant, Jayanti; Pant, Mahendra Kumar; Naithani, Manisha",Adv Med Educ Pract,432,12

It is becoming apparent that key roles in the transition are played by pH and a more compact closed form, termed locked. Calculations of pH-dependence are made for a large set of spike trimers, including locked form trimer structures that have recently become available. Several acidic sidechains become sufficiently buried in the locked form to give a predicted pH-dependence in the mild acidic range, with stabilisation of the locked form as pH reduces from 7.5 to 5, consistent with emerging characterisation by cryo-electron microscopy. The calculated pH effects in pre-fusion spike trimers are modulated mainly by aspartic acid residues, rather than the more familiar histidine role at mild acidic pH. These acidic sidechains are generally surface located and weakly interacting when not in a locked conformation. According to this model, their replacement (perhaps with asparagine) would remove the pH-dependent destabilisation of locked spike trimer conformations, and increase their recovery at neutral pH. This would provide an alternative or supplement to the insertion of disulphide linkages for stabilising spike protein trimers, with potential relevance for vaccine design.","Lobo, Vanessa R.; Warwicker, Jim",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,432,20

Critically ill COVID patients are at increased risk of serious thrombotic events and hence increased mortality. On the other side, COVID-19 patients are also showing major life-threatening bleeds, especially when systemic anticoagulation is used. Pro-coagulant propensity in critically ill COVID-19 patients have been published, but very few have described the incidence of major bleeding and its characteristics. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively observed the incidence of major bleed in 25 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Six cases were identified and described together with their outcome. RESULTS: Major bleeding occurred in six of the 25 studied patients. Four patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation at the onset of the bleed, two required embolization for bleeding control and one died from hemorrhagic shock. Half of the described cases had unusual sites of bleeding including gluteal and abdominal wall muscles. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of major bleeding was witnessed in our sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, with the majority being on therapeutic anticoagulation. This rate may be higher than previously reported, necessitating additional attention from the treating physician when considering empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. Moreover, the uncommon sites of bleeding shed the light on the need for additional studies in our population to identify the predisposing risk factors and mechanisms behind it.","Koubaissi, Salwa A.; Daou, Michella Abi Zeid; Mohamad, Rayan; Husari, Ahmad",J Thromb Thrombolysis,432,1

Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen’s nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.","Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Grelli, Sandro; Ciotti, Marco; Miano, Roberto; Andreoni, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",Cell Death Discov,432,16

In contrast, the potential impact of COVID -19 vaccination on asthma is entirely unexplored. Case Study We are shedding light on this critical topic by examining a challenging case of severe asthma exacerbation that a 28-year-old female patient developed after receiving two doses of mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) at our Hospital, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo of Pavia, in Northern Italy. The patient is a fourth year resident at the hospital, and like all health care workers at the facility, has been vaccinated since early 2021. She was an occasional smoker with a 10-year history of asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis. She also tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on several negative molecular swabs and serology tests. Results After receiving the second vaccine dose, she started experiencing a worsening of respiratory symptoms. Following several episodes, and a severe asthma attack, the patient required treatment with mepolizumab, a biologic drug [interleukin-5 (IL-5)] antagonist monoclonal antibody. Conclusion This single case study is insufficient to draw conclusions about the association between asthma exacerbation and the COVID-19 vaccine. While the cause-effect link between vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and worsening of asthmatic disease might only be suggested, we consider the present case as a valuable prompt for further investigations. This is particularly true from the perspective of mass vaccination of adolescents and children currently underway across the globe.","Colaneri, Marta; De Filippo, Maria; Licari, Amelia; Marseglia, Alessia; Maiocchi, Laura; Ricciardi, Alessandra; Corsico, Angelo; Marseglia, Gianluigi; Mondelli, Mario Umberto; Bruno, Raffaele",Int J Infect Dis,432,16

The impacts of lockdown policies on joint surgeries are unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries, and explored whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care. Patients and methods — In 1,344,355 persons aged ≥ 35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having (1) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures, and (2) electively planned surgeries due to hip osteoarthritis before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13, 2020, for different age and sex groups. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) reflect the after-lockdown number of surgeries divided by the before-lockdown number of surgeries. Results — After-lockdown elective hip surgeries comprised one-third the number of before-lockdown (IRR ∼0.3), which is a greater drop than that seen in all-cause elective hospital care (IRR ∼0.6). Men aged 35–69 had half the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries (IRR ∼0.6), whereas women aged ≥ 70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR ∼1). Only women aged 35–69 and men aged ≥ 70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR ∼0.80) Interpretation — It is important to note for future pandemics management that lockdown restrictions may impact more on scheduled joint surgery than other scheduled hospital care. Lockdown may also impact the number of emergency joint surgeries for men aged ≥ 35 but not those for women aged ≥ 70.","Magnusson, Karin; Helgeland, Jon; Grøsland, Mari; Telle, Kjetil",Acta orthopaedica,432,18

However, few are known about the mental health of physicians and nurses working in general hospitals during the outbreak, caring for patients with COVID-19 or not. OBJECTIVES: This survey assessed differences in mental health in physicians and nurses working in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 medical care units. DESIGN: A cross-sectional mixed-mode survey was used to assess burnout, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress. SETTING: A total of 1,244 physicians and nurses from five general hospitals in Belgium, working in COVID-19 care units (CCU), non-COVID-19 care units (NCCU), or both (CCU + NCCU) were informed of the study. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred forty-seven healthcare workers participated in the survey (response rate = 52%). MEASUREMENTS: Validated instruments were used to assess the outcomes: the PFI (burnout/professional fulfillment), the ISI (insomnia), and the DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, and stress). RESULTS: Results showed high prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among participants. After adjusting for confounders, multivariate analysis of variance showed no differences between CCU, NCCU, and CCU + NCCU workers. Univariate general linear models showed higher level of burnout, insomnia, and anxiety among nurses in comparison to physicians. Being a nurse, young, isolated, with an increased workload were risk factors for worse mental health outcomes. LIMITATIONS: The mental health of the tested sample, before the outbreak, is unknown. Moreover, this cross-sectional design provides no information on the evolution of the mental health outcomes over time. CONCLUSION: Directly caring for patients with COVID-19 is not associated with worse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in general hospitals. High prevalence of burnout, insomnia, depression, and anxiety among physicians and nurses requires special attention, and specific interventions need to be implemented.

We aimed to investigate use and views towards telehealth among allied health clinicians treating people with musculoskeletal conditions during the pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional international survey of allied health clinicians who used telehealth to manage musculoskeletal conditions during the coronavirus pandemic. Questions covered demographics, clinician-related factors (e.g. profession, clinical experience and setting), telehealth use (e.g. proportion of caseload, treatments used), attitudes towards telehealth (Likert scale), and perceived barriers and enablers (open questions). Data were presented descriptively, and an inductive qualitative thematic content analysis approach was used for qualitative data, based on the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behavioural Model. RESULTS: 827 clinicians participated, mostly physiotherapists (82%) working in Australia (70%). Most (71%, 587/827) reported reduced revenue (mean (SD) 62% (24.7%)) since the pandemic commenced. Median proportion of people seen via telehealth increased from 0% pre (IQR 0 to 1) to 60% during the pandemic (IQR 10 to 100). Most clinicians reported managing common musculoskeletal conditions via telehealth. Less than half (42%) of clinicians surveyed believed telehealth was as effective as face-to-face care. A quarter or less believed patients value telehealth to the same extent (25%), or that they have sufficient telehealth training (21%). Lack of physical contact when working through telehealth was perceived to hamper accurate and effective diagnosis and management.

Universities must plan for COVID-19 cases to arrive on campus and facilitate mitigations to reduce the spread of disease. It is likely that the first two weeks will be crucial to stop spread of introduced cases. Following that, the risk of introduction of new cases onto campus will be from interactions between students, staff and the local community as well as students travelling off campus for personal, educational or recreational reasons.","Perez-Reche, F.; Strachan, N.",,432,27

As one of the drugs recommended in Chinese guidelines, Lianhua Qingwen Granules or Capsules (LQ) are widely used.This systematic review and meta-analysis amis to evaluate the clinical efficacy of LQ on the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Seven databases(PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, VIP, CBM and Wanfang ) were searched to include all appropriate clinical trials that explore the efficacy of LQ on the treatment of COVID-19. RESULT: A total of 3 trials including 245 COVID-19 patients were eventually enrolled.Compared with the control group,the LQ group showed great significant difference on reducing the rate of clinical change to severe or critical condition[RR = 0.38, 95%CI (0.17,0.85), P < 0.05]and the fever time (SMD =-0.57,95%CI (-0.96,-0.17), P<0.05),as well as the significant improvement on the disappearance rate of the clinical symptoms: fever [RR = 1.36,95%CI (1.14,1.61), P < 0.05],cough[RR = 1.99,95%CI (1.39,2.86), P < 0.05],fatigue[RR = 1.52,95%CI (1.15,2.01), P < 0.05] and anhelation [RR = 4.18,95%CI (1.99,8.81), P < 0.05], but no significance on expectoration[RR = 2.46,95%CI (0.81,7.51), P < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: The clinical application of LQ on the treatment of COVID-19 has significant efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and reducing the rate of clinical change to severe or critical condition. Nevertheless, due to the limited quantity and quality of the included studies, more and higher quality trials with more observational indicators are expected to be published.","Zhuang, Jieqin; Dai, Xingzhen; Jin, Zilin; Cai, Hairong; Wu, Qihua; Zhang, Weizhang; Gao, Huanjia; Chen, Bojun",Complement Ther Med,432,22

There are and will always be outbreaks of infection from airborne diseases. Our objective was to assess the potential risk of airborne virus transmission during CPR in open-air conditions. METHODS: We performed advanced high-fidelity three-dimensional modelling and simulations to predict airborne transmission during out-of-hospital hands-only CPR. The computational model considers complex fluid dynamics and heat transfer phenomena such as aerosol evaporation, breakup, coalescence, turbulence, and local interactions between the aerosol and the surrounding fluid. Furthermore, we incorporated the effects of the wind speed/direction, the air temperature and relative humidity on the transport of contaminated saliva particles emitted from a victim during a resuscitation process based on an Airborne Infection Risk (AIR) Index. RESULTS: The results reveal low-risk conditions that include wind direction and high relative humidity and temperature. High-risk situations include wind directed to the rescuer, low humidity and temperature. Combinations of other conditions have an intermediate AIR Index and risk for the rescue team. CONCLUSIONS: The fluid dynamics, simulation-based AIR Index provides a classification of the risk of contagion by victim's aerosol in the case of hands-only CPR considering environmental factors such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature. Therefore, we recommend that rescuers perform a quick assessment of their airborne infectious risk before starting CPR in the open air and positioning themselves to avoid wind directed to their faces.","Dbouk, Talib; Aranda-García, Silvia; Barcala-Furelos, Roberto; Rodríguez-Núñez, Antonio; Drikakis, Dimitris",Emerg Med J,432,20

There is an urgent unmet need to provide an easy-to-produce, affordable medicine to prevent transmission and provide early treatment for this disease. The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 µg/ mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several countries. Xylitol at a concentration of 5 % m/V has proved to be viricidal on its own and the association with iota-carrageenan may be beneficial, as well.","Bansal, Shruti; Jonsson, Colleen B.; Taylor, Shannon L.; Figueroa, Juan Manuel; Dugour, Andrea Vanesa; Palacios, Carlos; César Vega, Julio",bioRxiv,432,1

The purpose of our research is to examine the relations between the competences of crisis management in healthcare facilities and the performance of employees, measured during the acute stage of the crisis by their feeling of satisfaction, safety and creation of conditions for work, whereby we assume that these variables are mutually interlinked by the sharing of information, teamwork and cognitive diversity of the work teams. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire survey was created and used based on a sample of 216 mid-level managers of health care facilities in Slovakia, which took place during the first month after the outbreak of the crisis (during the month of March/April 2020). The Baron and Kenny mediator model has been used for research purposes and the Freedman–Schatzkin test has been used to test the mediator effect. Regression analysis has been used to verify the hypotheses. The control variables were the size of the healthcare facility based on the number of employees, gender and age of the manager, his position in the management hierarchy and the duration of practice in a management position. The ANOVA analysis of variance was used to analyze multiple dependencies. The level of significance was 5%. The research sample consisted of 216 managers at different types of healthcare facilities. RESULTS: The hypothesis for the dependency between the crisis competences of management and performance of teams during the acute stage of the crisis, facilitated by sharing information, teamwork and cognitive diversity of crisis management was confirmed. It is a multilateral incomplete mediation, where almost two thirds of the total effect are facilitated by mediators, of which the sharing of information has the greatest effect (35%). CONCLUSION: Based on our mediation model, healthcare facilities, which strive to implement crisis management during the acute stage of the crisis, should place emphasis especially on reliable background information and the fast sharing of information, supporting the performance of healthcare teams. The strategies for achieving these goals should also include education focused on the development of managerial competences.","Jankelová, Nadežda; Joniaková, Zuzana; Blštáková, Jana; Skorková, Zuzana; Procházková, Katarína",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,432,20

The negative effect of such a lockdown may propagate to other regions through supply chains because of supply and demand shortages. Applying an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly 1.6 million firms in Japan, we simulate what would happen to production activities outside Tokyo if production activities that are not essential to citizens’ survival in Tokyo were shut down for a certain period. We find that if Tokyo were locked down for a month, the indirect effect on other regions would be twice as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of 27 trillion yen in Japan or 5.2% of the country’s annual GDP. Although the production that would be shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the lockdown would result in an 86% reduction of the daily production in Japan after one month.","Inoue, Hiroyasu; Todo, Yasuyuki",PLoS One,432,20

Here we describe our experience using the social virtual reality (VR) platform Mozilla Hubs for the pre-interview social during the 2020-2021 radiology residency virtual recruitment season, provide results of a survey sent to assess applicants' attitudes towards the VR pre-interview social, and outline additional use-cases for the emerging technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS A VR Meeting Hall dedicated to the pre-interview social was designed in Mozilla Hubs. To assess applicants' impressions of the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social, applicants were sent an optional web-based survey. Survey respondents were asked to respond to a series of eleven statements using a five-point Likert scale of perceived agreement: Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Statements were designed to gauge applicants' attitudes towards the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social and its usefulness in helping them learn about the residency program, particularly in comparison with pre-interview socials held on conventional video conferencing software (CVCS). RESULTS Of the 120 residency applicants invited to the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social, 111 (93%) attended. Of these, 68 (61%) participated in the anonymous survey. Most applicants reported a better overall experience with Mozilla Hubs compared to CVCS (47/68, 69%), with 10% (7/68) reporting a worse overall experience, and 21% (14/68) neutral. Most applicants reported the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social allowed them to better assess residency culture than did pre-interview socials using CVCS (41/68, 60%). Seventy-two percent of applicants reported that the Mozilla Hubs pre-interview social positively impacted their decision to strongly consider the residency program (49/68). CONCLUSION Radiology residency applicants overall preferred a pre-interview social hosted on a social VR platform, Mozilla Hubs, compared to those hosted on CVCS. Applicants reported the use of a social VR platform reflected positively on the residency and positively impacted their decision to strongly consider the program.","Guichet, Phillip L; Huang, Jeffrey; Zhan, Chenyang; Millet, Alexandra; Kulkarni, Kopal; Chhor, Chloe; Mercado, Cecilia; Fefferman, Nancy",Academic radiology,432,20

RECENT FINDINGS: Ten studies described hypertension CDS systems. Novel advances included the integration of patient-collected blood pressure data, automated information retrieval and management support, and use of CDS in low-resource/developing-world settings and in pediatrics. Findings suggest that CDS increases hypertension detection/control, yet many children and adults with hypertension remain undetected or undercontrolled. CDS challenges included poor usability (from lack of health record integration, excessive data entry requests, and wireless connectivity challenges) and lack of clinician trust in blood pressure measures. SUMMARY: Hypertension CDS has improved but not closed gaps in the detection and control of hypertension in children and adults. The studies reviewed indicate that the usability of CDS and the system where CDS is deployed (e.g., commitment to high-quality blood pressure measurement/infrastructure) may impact CDS’s ability to increase hypertension detection and control.","Vuppala, Suchith; Turer, Christy B.",Curr Hypertens Rep,432,1

Our aim was to examine ventilation characteristics and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Argentina, an upper middle-income country. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre cohort study (SATICOVID), we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who were on invasive mechanical ventilation and admitted to one of 63 ICUs in Argentina. Patient demographics and clinical, laboratory, and general management variables were collected on day 1 (ICU admission); physiological respiratory and ventilation variables were collected on days 1, 3, and 7. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. All patients were followed until death in hospital or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes were ICU mortality, identification of independent predictors of mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and patterns of change in physiological respiratory and mechanical ventilation variables. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04611269, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between March 20, 2020, and Oct 31, 2020, we enrolled 1909 invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19, with a median age of 62 years [IQR 52–70]. 1294 (67·8%) were men, hypertension and obesity were the main comorbidities, and 939 (49·2%) patients required vasopressors. Lung-protective ventilation was widely used and median duration of ventilation was 13 days (IQR 7–22). Median tidal volume was 6·1 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 6·0–7·0) on day 1, and the value increased significantly up to day 7; positive end-expiratory pressure was 10 cm H(2)O (8–12) on day 1, with a slight but significant decrease to day 7. Ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) was 160 (IQR 111–218), respiratory system compliance 36 mL/cm H(2)O (29–44), driving pressure 12 cm H(2)O (10–14), and FiO(2) 0·60 (0·45–0·80) on day 1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in 1672 (87·6%) of patients; 1176 (61·6%) received prone positioning. In-hospital mortality was 57·7% (1101/1909 patients) and ICU mortality was 57·0% (1088/1909 patients); 462 (43·8%) patients died of refractory hypoxaemia, frequently overlapping with septic shock (n=174). Cox regression identified age (hazard ratio 1·02 [95% CI 1·01–1·03]), Charlson score (1·16 [1·11–1·23]), endotracheal intubation outside of the ICU (ie, before ICU admission; 1·37 [1·10–1·71]), vasopressor use on day 1 (1·29 [1·07–1·55]), D-dimer concentration (1·02 [1·01–1·03]), PaO(2)/FiO(2) on day 1 (0·998 [0·997–0·999]), arterial pH on day 1 (1·01 [1·00–1·01]), driving pressure on day 1 (1·05 [1·03–1·08]), acute kidney injury (1·66 [1·36–2·03]), and month of admission (1·10 [1·03–1·18]) as independent predictors of mortality. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation, lung-protective ventilation was widely used but mortality was high. Predictors of mortality in our study broadly agreed with those identified in studies of invasively ventilated patients in high-income countries. The sustained burden of COVID-19 on scarce health-care personnel might have contributed to high mortality over the course of our study in Argentina. These data might help to identify points for improvement in the management of patients in middle-income countries and elsewhere. FUNDING: None.

Given the high prevalence and growing incidence of this clinical condition in the general population in both high and low-income countries, antihypertensive drug therapies are frequently prescribed in different hypertension-related CV diseases and comorbidities. Among these conditions, evidence are available demonstrating the clinical benefits of lowering blood pressure (BP) levels, particularly in those hypertensive patients at high or very high CV risk profile. Preliminary studies, performed during the Sars-COVID-19 epidemic, raised some concerns on the potential implication of hypertension and antihypertensive medications in the susceptibility of having severe pneumonia, particularly with regard to the use of drugs inhibiting the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These hypotheses were not confirmed by subsequent studies, which independently and systematically demonstrated no clinical harm of these drugs also in patients with Sars-COVID-19 infection. The aim of this narrative review is to critically discuss the available evidence supporting the use of antihypertensive therapies based RAS blocking agents in hypertensive patients with different CV risk profile and with additional clinical conditions or comorbidities, including Sars-COVID-19 infection, with a particular focus on single-pill combination therapies based on olmesartan medoxomil.","Presta, Vivianne; Figliuzzi, Ilaria; Citoni, Barbara; Gallo, Giovanna; Battistoni, Allegra; Tocci, Giuliano; Volpe, Massimo",High Blood Press Cardiovasc Prev,432,5

Among them, indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug, was shown to have potent in-vitro antiviral properties on human SARS-CoV-1, canine CCoV, and more recently on human SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar range. Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach. A multi-stage model-based approach was developed to characterize % of recovery and viral load in CCoV-infected dogs, to estimate the PK of indomethacin in dog and human using published data after administration of immediate (IR) and sustained-release (SR) formulations, and to estimate the expected antiviral activity as a function of different assumptions on the effective exposure in human. Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day). The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation. The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among all medical students studying in six batches of the Faculty of Medicine and Allied Sciences, Rajarata University of Sri Lanka, in June 2020. A Google form in English with 10 statements about individual perceptions of medical students’ roles and their willingness to assist in the COVID-19 health sector response via value-added roles was used to collect data. The responses were recorded on a five-point Likert scale. The chi-squared test for independence was used to explore the associations between the academic year and the responses to each statement. RESULTS: Out of 856 (response rate 79.6%) study participants, the majority were females (n=601, 70.2%). The majority (n=804, 93.9%) reported that they have a responsibility to contribute to the country’s COVID-19 health sector response. There was a statistically significant association between medical students’ perceived level of clinical knowledge, having the clinical skills to assist in the COVID-19 health sector response and academic year (p<0.001). The commonly identified value-added roles were developing (n=770, 89.9%) and disseminating (n=744, 86.9%) health education messages, and field contact tracing activities (n=653, 76.3%). Other value-added roles were assisting the curative health sector in COVID-19 patient management (n=380, 44.4%) and other non-COVID-19 patient management (n=463, 54.1%). CONCLUSION: Medical students are mostly willing to engage in preventive health sector value-added roles and, to a lesser extent, in curative health sector value-added roles during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, medical educators need to clearly define the value-added roles and provide adequate training and supervision for medical students across academic years to enable them to combine learning with making meaningful contributions to the health-care system during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wickramasinghe, Nuwan Darshana; Jayarathne, Shamalee Wasana; Pilapitiya, Senaka Devendra",Int J Gen Med,432,3

In the last few years, environmental viral metagenomics has grown significantly and has enabled the identification, diversity and entire genome sequencing of viruses in environmental and clinical samples extensively. Prior to the arrival of metagenomics, traditional molecular procedures such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, were mostly used to identify and classify enteric viral species in different environmental milieu. After the advent of metagenomics, more detailed reports have emerged about the important waterborne viruses identified in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface water. This paper provides a review of methods that have been used for the concentration, detection and identification of viral species from different environmental matrices. The review also takes into consideration where metagenomics has been explored in different African countries, as well as the limitations and challenges facing the approach.

The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand. Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip. The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe. When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface. Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor. This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody. We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva.","Yousefi, Hanie; Mahmud, Alam; Chang, Dingran; Das, Jagotamoy; Gomis, Surath; Chen, Jenise B.; Wang, Hansen; Been, Terek; Yip, Lily; Coomes, Eric; Li, Zhijie; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison; Christie, Natasha; Gray-Owen, Scott; Cochrane, Alan; Rini, James M.; Sargent, Edward H.; Kelley, Shana O.",J Am Chem Soc,432,16

In this study we have developed a flowchart based on two well-known diagnostic methods: the 'corona-score' and the 'CO-RADS'. This flowchart can be used in hospitals that use chest-CT, instead of chest X-ray, for COVID-19 suspected patients at the ED. Methods ED patients (n=1904) from the Jeroen Bosch Hospital, Amphia Hospital, HagaHospital, Elisabeth TweeSteden Hospital, Bernhoven Hospital and Slingeland Hospital were included. A laboratory-based 'corona-score', without radiology, called the 'lab-corona-score' was combined with a chest-CT based radiology scoring system (CO-RADS), to develop a flowchart. The performance was assessed by sensitivity/specificity analyses using the RT-PCR outcome or the physician's final diagnosis as golden standard. Results Out of the 1904 patients, 611 (32.1%) patients tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The lab-corona-score alone had an AUC of 0.86, a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 88% using cut-off values of 0-2 (negative) and 8-10 (positive). Of 255 patients, from the Amphia and Slingeland Hospitals, a CO-RADS score was determined. The flowchart, which combined the 'CO-RADS' with the 'lab-corona-score', was developed based on data from Slingeland Hospital (sensitivity 97%, specificity 96%). Hereafter, the performance of the flowchart was validated using an independent dataset from Amphia hospital, and reached a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 93%. A decision could be made in 79% of the patients, which was correct in 95% of the cases.

Amongst other limitations of current anti-HBV treatment, failure to eliminate the viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and emergence of resistance remain the most worrisome. Viral rebound from latent episomal cccDNA reservoirs occurs following cessation of therapy, patient non-compliance, or the development of escape mutants. Simultaneous viral co-infections, such as by HIV-1, further complicate therapeutic interventions. These challenges have prompted development of novel targeted hepatitis B therapies. Given the ease with which highly specific and potent nucleic acid therapeutics can be rationally designed, gene therapy has generated interest for antiviral application. Gene therapy strategies developed for HBV include gene silencing by harnessing RNA interference, transcriptional inhibition through epigenetic modification of target DNA, genome editing by designer nucleases, and immune modulation with cytokines. DNA-binding domains and effectors based on the zinc finger (ZF), transcription activator-like effector (TALE), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems are remarkably well suited to targeting episomal cccDNA.

A total of 3402 hospitalizations for COVID-19 and 3680 hospitalizations for influenza admitted between October 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020 across 127 Veterans Administration hospitals nationally were studied using the electronic medical record.

Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and vasopressors and experienced higher mortality. Proteinuria and hematuria were frequent in both groups but more common in COVID-19. Recovery of kidney function was less common in patients with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury but was similar among survivors. Thus, findings from this study confirm that acute kidney injury is more common and severe among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to influenza, a finding that may be driven largely by illness severity. Hence, the combined impact of these two illnesses on kidney health may be significant and have important implications for resource allocation.","Birkelo, Bethany C.; Parr, Sharidan K.; Perkins, Amy M.; Greevy, Robert A.; Hung, Adriana M.; Shah, Shailja C.; Arroyo, Juan Pablo; Denton, Jason; Vincz, Andrew J.; Matheny, Michael E.; Siew, Edward D.",Kidney Int,432,28

Therefore, the objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effect of beef cow udder score on cow performance and pre- and postweaning progeny performance. In a 5-yr study, crossbred cows at the Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory, Whitman, NE, were assigned an udder score each year at calving, from 1 to 5, using an udder and teat combination score. Cows were grouped by udder scores and classified as either low udder score (LUS, udder score 1 or 2; n = 223) or high udder score (HUS, udder score 3 or 4; n = 1,742). The udder score combines udder conformation and a teat scoring system. Low udder scores consisted of pendulous udders and large teats, whereas HUS consisted of tight udders and small, symmetrical teats. Mixed models were used to evaluate udder score on cow performance and calf pre- and postweaning performance. Cow body weight (BW) at prebreeding and weaning was greater (P < 0.01) in LUS cows compared with HUS counterparts. Pregnancy rate was not different (P = 0.35) between udder classification groups. Calf BW at birth (P = 0.95), weaning (P = 0.40), and adjusted 205-d BW (P = 0.28) were not different between udder groups. Cow udder score did not influence feedlot entry (P = 0.41) and final BW (P = 0.30), dry matter intake (P = 0.53), average daily gain (P = 0.60), and gain:feed ratio (P = 0.85) of steer progeny. However, steers from HUS dams had greater hot carcass weight (HCW; P = 0.04) and backfat thickness (P = 0.02) compared with LUS counterparts. Results from this study suggest cows with less desirable udder structure may not have a negative impact on calf preweaning growth and performance; however, backfat thickness and HCW in the finishing phase were lower in steers from cows with a lower udder score.","Beard, Joslyn K; Musgrave, Jacki A; Funston, Rick N; Mulliniks, J Travis",Transl Anim Sci,432,22

Epithelial cells lining the prostate acini release in a defined fashion (exocytosis) organellar nanosized structures named prostasomes. They are involved in the protection of sperm cells against immune response in the female reproductive tract by modulating the complement system and by inhibiting monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation. The immunomodulatory function most probably involves small non-coding RNAs present in prostasomes. Prostasomes have also been proposed to regulate the timing of sperm cell capacitation and induction of the acrosome reaction, since they are rich in various transferable bioactive molecules (e.g. receptors and enzymes) that promote the fertilising ability of sperm cells. Antigenicity of sperm cells has been well documented and implicated in involuntary immunological infertility of human couples, and antisperm antibodies (ASA) occur in several body fluids. The propensity of sperm cells to carry attached prostasomes suggests that they are a new category of sperm antigens.

In this study, we report the screening of viral pathogens in African simian game seized by French customs at Toulouse Blagnac Airport. Epifluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of virus‐like particles in the samples, and further metagenomic sequencing of the DNA and RNA viromes confirmed the presence of sequences related to the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae bacteriophage families; some of them infecting bacterial hosts that could be potentially pathogenic for humans. To increase the sensitivity of detection, twelve pan‐generic PCRs targeting several viral zoonoses were performed, but no positive signal was detected. A large‐scale inventory of bacteria, viruses and parasites is urgently needed to globally assess the risk for human health of the trade, manipulation and consumption of wildlife‐related bushmeat.","Temmam, Sarah; Davoust, Bernard; Chaber, Anne‐Lise; Lignereux, Yves; Michelle, Caroline; Monteil‐Bouchard, Sonia; Raoult, Didier; Desnues, Christelle",Transbound Emerg Dis,432,1

Pathogenesis and subsequent spread of infection requires replication of the viral genome and expression of structural and non-structural proteins of the virus. Generally, viruses use transcription and translation machinery of the host cell to achieve this objective. The viral genome encodes transcriptional regulators that alter the expression of viral and host genes by manipulating initiation and termination steps of transcription. The regulation of the initiation step is often through interactions of viral factors with gene specific factors as well as general transcription factors (GTFs). Among the GTFs, TFIIB (Transcription Factor IIB) is a frequent target during viral pathogenesis. TFIIB is utilized by a plethora of viruses including human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, vaccinia virus, Thogoto virus, hepatitis virus, Epstein-Barr virus and gammaherpesviruses to alter gene expression. A number of viral transcriptional regulators exhibit a direct interaction with host TFIIB in order to accomplish expression of their genes and to repress host transcription. Some viruses have evolved proteins with a three-dimensional structure very similar to TFIIB, demonstrating the importance of TFIIB for viral persistence. Upon viral infection, host transcription is selectively altered with viral transcription benefitting. The nature of viral utilization of TFIIB for expression of its own genes, along with selective repression of host antiviral genes and downregulation of general host transcription, makes TFIIB a potential candidate for antiviral therapies.","O’Brien, Michael J.; Ansari, Athar",Front Mol Biosci,432,1

These types of features we observe in many real‐life scenarios especially in the COVID‐19 data sets where the number of active cases over time starts falling and then again increases. In order to capture those features, we use Poisson INAR(1) process with a time‐varying smoothing covariate. By using such model, we can model both the components in the active cases at time‐point t namely ‐ (i) number of non‐recovery cases from the previous time‐point, and (ii) number of new cases at time‐point t. We study some theoretical properties of the proposed model along with forecasting. Some simulation studies are performed to study the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we analyze two COVID‐19 data sets and compare our proposed model to another PINAR(1) process which has time‐varying covariate but no change‐point, to demonstrate the overall performance of our proposed model.","Chattopadhyay, Subhankar; Maiti, Raju; Das, Samarjit; Biswas, Atanu",Stat Neerl,432,17

In the U.S, health care systems and governmental agencies have relied on several models such as IHME, YYG, MIT, CDC ensemble, etc. to predict short and long-term trends in disease activity. The Mayo Clinic Bayesian SIR model, recently been made publicly available, has informed Mayo Clinic practice leadership at all sites across the US and has been shared with Minnesota governmental leadership to help inform critical decisions over the past year. One key to the accuracy of the Mayo model is its ability to adapt to the constantly changing dynamics of the pandemic and uncertainties of human behavior, such as changes in the rate of contact among the population over time and by geographic location and now new virus variants. The Mayo model can also be used forecast COVID-19 trends in different hypothetical worlds in which (i) no vaccine is available, (ii) vaccinations are no longer being accepted from this point forward, and (iii) 75% of the population is already vaccinated. Surveys indicate that half of American adults are hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and lack of understanding of the benefits of vaccination is an important barrier to use.

Vaccination of the majority of any country's population is considered to be an effective way of controlling the spread and mortality of this infection. Therefore, it is important to assess the public's willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In this study, we evaluated the public willingness and hesitancy to take the vaccine in Afghanistan, during December 2020 and January 2021. Sociodemographic data, awareness on vaccine production, vaccine availability, willingness and hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine were collected. The Statistical Package for Social Studies (SPSS) version 25 was used for data analysis. A total of 806 complete responses were received. Majority of the respondents were ≤ 40 years old (89.8%) and male (72.7%). Less than two-thirds (509; 63%) of the participants reported willingness to take the vaccine when it becomes available, whereas almost one-third (297; 37%) of them were hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine. More female than male respondents were willing to take the vaccine (χ2 = 13.176, P value = 0.001). A significant portion of the public were not willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. In a country like Afghanistan, which already has a low coverage of vaccination, this could pose a challenge for the vaccination program against COVID-19 to be effective.

The role of inhibitory checkpoint receptors (ICRs) that induce T cell exhaustion during this disease is not known. Transcriptional profiling identified increased expression of ICRs including PD-1, PDL-1, PDL-2, TIM-3, and CTLA-4 in skin lesions of patients that was confirmed by immunohistology where there was increased expression of PD-1, TIM-3, and CTLA-4 in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets. Moreover, PDL-1/PDL-2 ligands were increased on skin macrophages compared to healthy controls. The proportions PD1(+), but not TIM-3 or CTLA-4 expressing T cells in the circulation were positively correlated with those in the lesions of the same patients, suggesting that PD-1 may regulate T cell function equally in both compartments. Blocking PD-1 signaling in circulating T cells enhanced their proliferative capacity and IFN-γ production, but not TNF-α secretion in response to L. braziliensis recall antigen challenge in vitro. While we previously showed a significant correlation between the accumulation of senescent CD8(+)CD45RA(+)CD27(-) T cells in the circulation and skin lesion size in the patients, there was no such correlation between the extent of PD-1 expression by circulating on T cells and the magnitude of skin lesions suggesting that exhausted-like T cells may not contribute to the cutaneous immunopathology. Nevertheless, we identified exhausted-like T cells in both skin lesions and in the blood. Targeting this population by PD-1 blockade may improve T cell function and thus accelerate parasite clearance that would reduce the cutaneous pathology in cutaneous leishmaniasis.","Garcia de Moura, Renan; Covre, Luciana Polaco; Fantecelle, Carlos Henrique; Gajardo, Vitor Alejandro Torres; Cunha, Carla Baroni; Stringari, Lorenzzo Lyrio; Belew, Ashton Trey; Daniel, Camila Batista; Zeidler, Sandra Ventorin Von; Tadokoro, Carlos Eduardo; de Matos Guedes, Herbert Leonel; Zanotti, Raphael Lubiana; Mosser, David; Falqueto, Aloisio; Akbar, Arne N.; Gomes, Daniel Claudio Oliveira",Front Immunol,432,16

It is unknown how palliative care was utilized in this context. Objectives: To describe the frequency of palliative care consultation and its association with end-of-life care for deceased patients with COVID-19. Methods: Adults who were admitted to our institution between February 23, 2020, and April 21, 2020, and died from COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome was the frequency of palliative care consultation. Secondary analyses included the association of palliative care consultation with code status at the time of death, life-sustaining treatments, mechanical ventilation, invasive procedures, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and length of hospital stay. Results: The 203 patients were 61% male with median age 76 (interquartile range [IQR] 67-84) years. Palliative care was consulted for 113 patients (56%). At baseline, they were less independent in instrumental activities of daily living (28 patients, 26.1%, vs. 47 patients, 49.0%, p < 0.01) and had more do-not-resuscitate orders (35 patients, 32.7%, vs. 11 patients, 11.5%, p < 0.01). Palliative care consultation was associated with fewer invasive procedures (0, IQR 0-2, vs. 2, IQR 0-3, p < 0.01), less mechanical ventilation (32 patients, 29.9% vs. 65 patients, 67.7%, p < 0.01), and fewer ICU admissions (33 patients, 30.8% vs. 69 patients, 71.9%, p < 0.01). Palliative care was associated with shorter ICU stays (0 days, IQR 0-4, vs. 4 days, IQR 0-12, p < 0.01), whereas hospital stays did not differ significantly (8 days, IQR 5-12.5, vs. 10 days, IQR 5-16.3, p = 0.15).

In particular, a strong increase in the number of people over 90 is expected in the next two decades. As this phenomenon will lead to an increase in illness and age-related dependency, the study of long-lived people represents an opportunity to explore which lifestyle factors are associated with healthy aging and which with the emergence of age-related diseases, especially Alzheimer’s type dementia. The project “Factors associated with healthy and pathologically aging in a sample of elderly people over 90 in the city of Madrid” (MADRID+90) brings together a multidisciplinary research team in neurodegenerative diseases that includes experts in epidemiology, neurology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging and computational neuroscience. In the first phase of the project, a stratified random sampling was carried out according to the census of the city of Madrid followed by a survey conducted on 191 people aged 90 and over. This survey gathered information on demographics, clinical data, lifestyles and cognitive status. Here, the main results of that survey are showed. The second phase of the project aims to characterize individual trajectories in the course of either healthy and pathological aging, from a group of 50 subjects over 90 who will undergo a comprehensive clinical examination comprised of neurological and cognitive testing, MRI and EEG. The ultimate goal of the project is to characterize the biophysical and clinical profiles of a population that tends to receive little attention in the literature.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate UK and Ireland clinicians’ experiences concerning changes in AP during the COVID-19 pandemic and their recommendations for change. METHODS: Online survey of participants at previous AP national workshops, members of the Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland and other professional organisations, with snowball sampling. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-one replies were received between 9 and 19 April 2020 from clinicians in community, hospice and hospital settings across all areas of the UK and Ireland. Changes to AP local guidance and practice were reported: route of administration (47%), drugs prescribed (38%), total quantities prescribed (35%), doses and ranges (29%). Concerns over shortages of nurses and doctors to administer subcutaneous injections led 37% to consider drug administration by family or social caregivers, often by buccal, sublingual and transdermal routes. Clinical contact and patient assessment were more often remote via telephone or video (63%). Recommendations for regulatory changes to permit drug repurposing and easier community access were made.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. DISCUSSION: Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients.

However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2(1–5). Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titers: less than 1:50 in 33% and below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody sequencing revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) as low as single digit ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","Robbiani, Davide F.; Gaebler, Christian; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C.

The relations remain constant after several robustness tests. These findings suggest that investors concern about the potential risk when firms are located in the provinces with higher threats to public health.

El tratamiento y la evolución en octogenarios no están bien definidos. Nuestro objetivo es describir sus características clínicas, los tratamientos empleados y su evolución clínica. PACIENTES Y MÉTODO: estudio retrospectivo observacional de pacientes consecutivos ingresados con infección por SARS-CoV-2 confirmada, con neumonía por estudio radiológico o tomografía de tórax, que cumplían criterios de STC y que recibieron tratamiento. Clasificamos a los pacientes en los que recibieron sólo pulsos de glucocorticoides (GC), o pulsos de GC y tocilizumab. Determinamos niveles séricos de ferritina, PCR y dímeros-D. La variable final fue la supervivencia. RESULTADOS: 21 pacientes con una edad de 83 años (80-88 años). La ferritina media fue de 1056 microg/L (317-3553), la PCR de 115,8mg/dL (22-306) y los dímeros-D de 2,9mg/L (0,45-17,5). Todos los pacientes recibieron pulsos de GC y en dos casos simultáneamente tocilizumab. El tiempo medio de seguimiento fue de 13,7 días (8-21). La mortalidad global fue del 38,1% (8/21pacientes).

ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Cytokine storm syndrome (CTS) is a serious complication of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment and evolution in octogenarians are not well defined. Our objective is to describe its clinical characteristics, the treatments and its clinical evolution. PATIENTS AND METHOD: retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with pneumonia by radiological study or chest tomography, whIth STC criteria and who received treatment. We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. We determined serum levels of ferritin, CRP and D-dimers. The final variable was survival. RESULTS: 21 patients, (80-88 years). The mean ferritin was 1056 microg/L (317-3553), CRP 115.8mg/dL (22-306) and D-dimers 2.9m/L (0.45-17.5). All patients received GC pulses and in two cases simultaneously tocilizumab. The mean follow-up time was 13.7 days (8-21). The overall mortality was 38.1% (8/21 patients). The 2 patients who received tocilizumab died. The deceased had significantly higher levels of ferritin (1254 vs. 925microg/L; p=0.045) and CRP (197.6 vs. 76mg / dL; p = 0.007). At the end of the follow-up, a decrease in the biochemical parameters was observed with ferritin of 727microg / L, CRP of 27mg/dl and DD of 1.18mg / L. In 13/21 patients (61.9%), the CTS was controlled without the need to add other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: STC mortality from SARS-CoV-2 is high despite treatment. A greater inflammatory response was associated with a higher mortality. Although it seems that the early use of GC pulses could control it, and the use of other treatments such as tocilizumab shouldo be, with the study design and its limitations, this conclusion cannot be stablished.","Luis Callejas Rubio, José; Millán, Ismael Aomar; Higueras, Manuela Moreno; Medina, Leopoldo Muñoz; López, María López; Torres, Ángel Ceballos",Rev Esp Geriatr Gerontol,432,23

About 15% of patients present with arthralgia at some point. Although COVID-19 seems to attack the musculoskeletal system (muscles and joints) in its infective and postinfective stage causing inflammatory arthritis, not much is known about the rheumatic manifestations of this infection. In this case series of 5 patients, we discuss the occurrence of bilaterally symmetrical polyarthritis in patients, previously free from any rheumatic disease, after encountering COVID-19 infection. The musculoskeletal manifestations in these patients phenotypically resembled rheumatoid arthritis. These patients were treated successfully with low-dose glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).","Mukarram, Muhammad Shariq; Ishaq Ghauri, Muhammad; Sethar, Sehrish; Afsar, Nasir; Riaz, Amir; Ishaq, Khizra",Case Rep Rheumatol,432,3

Here, we identified non-synonymous mutations in MHC-I restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes after deep sequencing of 747 SARS-CoV- 2 virus isolates. Mutant peptides exhibited diminished or abrogated MHC-I binding, which was associated with a loss of recognition and functional responses by CD8+ T cells isolated from HLA-matched COVID-19 patients. Our findings highlight the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to subvert CD8+ T cell surveillance through escape mutations in MHCI-restricted viral epitopes. This provides evolutionary evidence for CD8+ T cell immunity controlling SARS-CoV-2 with consequences for COVID-19 vaccine design.","Agerer, Benedikt; Koblischke, Maximilian; Gudipati, Venugopal; Smyth, Mark; Popa, Alexandra; Genger, Jakob-Wendelin; Endler, Lukas; Florian, David M.; Mühlgrabner, Vanessa; Lercher, Alexander; Gattinger, Pia; Torralba-Gombau, Ricard; Penz, Thomas; Fae, Ingrid; Wenda, Sabine; Traungott, Marianna; Walder, Gernot; Fischer, Gottfried; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Pawelka, Erich; Zoufaly, Alexander; Valenta, Rudolf; Bock, Christoph; Huppa, Johannes B.; Aberle, Judith H.; Bergthaler, Andreas",bioRxiv,432,16

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. MethodsDaily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. ResultsAlthough Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. ConclusionThe lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in imported cases.","Chong, Ka Chun; Cheng, Wei; Zhao, Shi; Ling, Feng; Mohammad, Kirran; Wang, Maggie; Zee, Benny; Wei, Lei; Xiong, Xi; Liu, Hengyan; Wang, Jingxuan; Chen, Enfu",,432,17

One hundred ninety‐four stool samples from calves with diarrhoea less than one‐month old were collected from five different geographical regions of country in order to detect coronavirus and characterize it if coronavirus was found. Samples were screened for the presence of BCoV by using a commercially available ELISA kit. Furthermore, RT‐PCR was carried out on positive samples for confirmation of the presence of N and S specific genes. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was carried out following RT‐PCR tests. 7.2% of samples, were positive for BCoV and all stool samples from the South‐West, Northeast and West regions of Iran were negative. The results showed that all the strains of coronavirus identified in Iran were completely in independent clusters and that they did not stand in the same cluster as any of the strains identified in other parts of the world.

Its impact on the governance and delivery of health provisions on such individuals, however, has received less attention. Drawing on interviews with 27 policy elites involved with England’s prison health policy, interviewees perceive that austerity policies have shaped and constrained the prison health system through the politics of deterioration, drift, distraction, and denial. The deterioration of the prison workforce size has been linked to diminished prisoner access to healthcare, attendant with an increased number of riots, assaults, acts of self-harm, and suicides. Concurrently, the microeconomic structure of organised crime is filling the void in prison governance, thus conducing to heightened abuse of psychoactive substances, as well as a surge in associated medical emergencies and violence. Successful prosecution of prior sexual offences, continued incarceration of those imprisoned for indeterminate sentences, and harsh sentencing practices have created policy drift, unremitting overcrowding, and reinforced excessive dependency on prison healthcare resources. The rapid turnover of justice ministers and intensified push for prison privatisation have enabled widespread distraction. Moreover, despite well-documented crises besetting English prisons, politicians seemingly remain in a state of denial. Preventive imprisonment, recurrent spending, and enhanced financial and political accountability measures are necessary to mitigate the effects of austerity and germane policies fomenting inimical impacts on England’s prison health system.","Ismail, Nasrul",Health Policy,432,8

Three of these epitopes are located on the nucleoprotein (N48 amino acids 46 to 60; N272, amino acids 272 to 286; and N321 amino acid 321 to 335), and one on the membrane protein (M196, amino acids 196 to 210). N321, peptide induced the highest T cell response and was recognized by immune miniswine lymphocytes with haplotypes dd, aa , and cc. T lymphocytes from peptide N321-immune miniswine reconstituted the in vitro synthesis of TGEV-specific antibodies by complementing CD4- TGEV-immune cells. This response was directed at least against the three major structural proteins. The synthesized antibodies specific for S protein preferentially recognized discontinous epitopes and neutralized TGEV infectivity. These results show that peptide N321 defines a functional T helper epitope eliciting T cells capable of collaborating with B cells specific for different proteins of TGEV.","Antón, Inés M.; Suñé, Carlos; Meloen, Rob H.; Borrás-Cuesta, Francisco; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,432,17

First, we argue that positive and negative emotions can coexist during the consumption experience. Second, positive emotions do not automatically lead to positive consumption outcomes, and negative emotions may not necessarily generate negative results. Third, positive or negative emotions toward a company employee might not automatically transfer to the company as a whole. Fourth, customers are not apathetic victims of their emotions with no capability to control their emotional experiences. Our last proposition is that consumption emotions are not a purely intrapersonal phenomenon, but that the social context matters and influences the consumption experience.

Disruptions to in-person schooling may have negatively and inequitably affected children’s mental health. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between school closures and child mental health outcomes and how it varies across sociodemographic factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional population-based survey study included a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 18 to 64 years with at least 1 child in the household. The survey was administered between December 2 and December 21, 2020, via web and telephone in English and Spanish. Participants were recruited from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel, an address-based panel with known probability sampling and coverage of 97% of US households. EXPOSURES: Schooling modality (in person, fully remote, or hybrid), household income, age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Child mental health difficulties were measured with the parent-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, with small, medium, and large effect sizes defined as 1.3-, 3.3-, and 5.2-point differences, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 2324 adults completed the survey. Overall, 1671 respondents (71.9%) were women, 244 (10.5%) were Black, 372 (16.0%) were Hispanic, and 421 (18.1%) had a high school education or less. Children attending school in-person had higher household incomes (mean difference, $9719; 95% CI, $4327 to $15 111; P < .001) and were more likely to be White compared with those attending remotely (366 of 556 [65.8%] vs 597 of 1340 [44.5%]; P < .001). Older children in remote schooling had more mental health difficulties than those attending in-person schooling (standardized effect size, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.39] per year older; P = .006), corresponding to small effect sizes in favor of in-person schooling for older children and very small effect sizes favoring remote schooling for younger children. Children from families with higher income benefitted more from attending schools in-person compared with their peers from families with lower income (B = −0.20 [95% CI, −0.10 to −0.30] per $10 000-increase in annual income; P < .001), although this advantage was not apparent for children attending hybrid school (B = −0.05 [95% CI, −0.16 to 0.06] per $10 000-increase in annual income; P = .34), and directionally lower but not significantly different for children attending remote school (B = −0.12 [95% CI, −0.04 to −0.20] per $10 000-increase in annual income; P < .001). Learning pods fully buffered the associations of hybrid schooling (d = −0.25; 95% CI, −0.47 to −0.04) but not remote schooling (d = 0.04; 95% CI, −0.10 to 0.18) with negative mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that older and Black and Hispanic children as well as those from families with lower income who attend school remotely may experience greater impairment to mental health than their younger, White, and higher-income counterparts. Ensuring that all students have access to additional educational and mental health resources must be an important public health priority, met with appropriate funding and workforce augmentation, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hawrilenko, Matt; Kroshus, Emily; Tandon, Pooja; Christakis, Dimitri",JAMA Netw Open,432,16

The use of human lung tissue is one solution for the study of such novel respiratory pathogens. We hypothesized that a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissue would allow for the ex vivo study of the interindividual heterogeneity of host response to SARS-CoV-2, thus providing a bridge between studies with cell lines and studies in animal models. We generated a cryobank of tissues from 21 donors, many of whom had clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19. Cryopreserved tissues preserved 90% cell viability and contained heterogenous populations of metabolically active epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell subsets of the human lung. Samples were readily infected with HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated comparable susceptibility to infection. In contrast, we observed a marked donor-dependent heterogeneity in the expression of IL6, CXCL8, and IFNB1 in response to SARS-CoV-2. Treatment of tissues with dexamethasone and the experimental drug N-hydroxycytidine suppressed viral growth in all samples, whereas chloroquine and remdesivir had no detectable effect. Metformin and sirolimus, molecules with predicted but unproven antiviral activity, each suppressed viral replication in tissues from a subset of donors. In summary, we developed a system for the ex vivo study of human SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human lung tissue from a library of donor tissues. This model may be useful for drug screening and for understanding basic mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Schaller, Matthew A.; Sharma, Yamini; Dupee, Zadia; Nguyen, Duy; Urueña, Juan; Smolchek, Ryan; Loeb, Julia C.; Machuca, Tiago N.; Lednicky, John A.; Odde, David J.; Campbell, Robert F.; Sawyer, W.

After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. One of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs also have the potential to prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them. But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because these exosomes apply the same immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs and they don’t have problems associated to cell maintenance and injections. For investigation the hypothesis, MSCs should be isolated from tissues and characterized. Then, the exosomes should be isolated from the supernatants and characterized. These exosomes should be injected into a transgenic animal for COVID-19. In the final section, lung function assessment, histological examination, micro-CT, differential leukocyte, viral load analysis, cytokine assay, and CRP level analysis can be investigated. COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has not been developed for it, so, numerous research studies are needed to find potential. Since the pathogenesis of this disease was identified in previous studies and can cause lung injury with ARDS, so, investigation of the therapeutic approaches that can suppress inflammation, cytokine storm and ARDS can be helpful in finding a novel therapeutic approach for this disease.","Taghavi-farahabadi, Mahsa; Mahmoudi, Mohammad; Soudi, Sara; Mahmoud Hashemi, Seyed",Med Hypotheses,432,1

Specific concerns have been raised concerning patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which are chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorders of the gut that frequently require immunosuppressive and biological therapies to control their activity. Accumulating evidence has so far demonstrated that patients with IBD are not at increased risk of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. As for the general population, the identified risk factors for severe COVID-19 course among IBD patients have been established to be advanced age and the presence of comorbidities. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids has also been associated with an increased risk of death in IBD patients with COVID-19. Information on COVID-19 is constantly evolving, with data growing at a rapid pace. This will guarantee better knowledge and stronger evidence to help physicians in the choice of the best therapeutic approach for each patient, concurrently controlling for the risk of IBD disease under treatment and the risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes and balancing the two. Moreover, the impact of the enormous number of severe respiratory patients on healthcare systems and facilities has led to an unprecedented redeployment of healthcare resources, significantly impacting the care of patients with chronic diseases. In this newly changed environment, the primary aim is to avoid harm whilst still providing adequate management. Telemedicine has been applied and is strongly encouraged for patients without the necessity of infusion therapy and whose conditions are stable. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has already revolutionized the management of patients with chronic immune-mediated diseases such as IBD. Direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be present for some time. This is the reason why continuous research, rapid solutions and constantly updated guidelines are of utmost importance. The aim of the present review is, therefore, to point out what has been learned so far as well as to pinpoint the unanswered questions and perspectives for the future.","Viganò, Chiara; Mulinacci, Giacomo; Palermo, Andrea; Barisani, Donatella; Pirola, Lorena; Fichera, Maria; Invernizzi, Pietro; Massironi, Sara",World J Gastroenterol,432,2

However, the degree to which people use mobile devices to help them make medical decisions remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore factors associated with self-reported use of tablets or smartphones to support medical decision making in a nationally representative sample of US adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from participants in the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, Cycle 2) were evaluated. There were 3504 responses in the full HINTS 5 Cycle 2 data set; 2321 remained after eliminating respondents who did not have complete data for all the variables of interest. The primary outcome was use of a tablet or smartphone to help make a decision about how to treat an illness or condition. Sociodemographic factors including gender, race/ethnicity, and education were evaluated. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth)- and electronic health (eHealth)-related factors were evaluated including (1) the presence of health and wellness apps on a tablet or smartphone, (2) use of electronic devices other than tablets and smartphones to monitor health (eg, Fitbit, blood glucose monitor, and blood pressure monitor), and (3) whether people shared health information from an electronic monitoring device or smartphone with a health professional within the last 12 months. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted using SAS version 9.4. Weighted population estimates and standard errors, univariate odds ratios, and 95% CIs were calculated, comparing respondents who used tablets or smartphones to help make medical decisions (n=944) with those who did not (n=1377), separately for each factor. Factors of interest with a P value of <.10 were included in a subsequent multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Compared with women, men had lower odds of reporting that a tablet or smartphone helped them make a medical decision. Respondents aged 75 and older also had lower odds of using a tablet or smartphone compared with younger respondents aged 18-34. By contrast, those who had health and wellness apps on tablets or smartphones, used other electronic devices to monitor health, and shared information from devices or smartphones with health care professionals had higher odds of reporting that tablets or smartphones helped them make a medical decision, compared with those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: A limitation of this research is that information was not available regarding the specific health condition for which a tablet or smartphone helped people make a decision or the type of decision made (eg, surgery, medication changes). In US adults, mHealth and eHealth use, and also certain sociodemographic factors are associated with using tablets or smartphones to support medical decision making. Findings from this study may inform future mHealth and other digital health interventions designed to support medical decision making.","Langford, Aisha; Orellana, Kerli; Kalinowski, Jolaade; Aird, Carolyn; Buderer, Nancy",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,432,21

Lyle’s flying fox (Pteropus lylei)‘s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak. METHODS: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January–December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored.","Wacharapluesadee, Supaporn; Duengkae, Prateep; Chaiyes, Aingorn; Kaewpom, Thongchai; Rodpan, Apaporn; Yingsakmongkon, Sangchai; Petcharat, Sininat; Phengsakul, Patcharakiti; Maneeorn, Pattarapol; Hemachudha, Thiravat",Virol J,432,16

We conducted a serosurveillance using antibody testing in an area where official report of COVID‐19 infection is not done yet. Blood samples were obtained from 1404 healthcare workers (41 ± 11 years) in our hospital on May 29–31, 2020. First, the potential infection frequency was confirmed using two quantitative antibody tests. In addition, the usefulness of rapid antibody kit testing for COVID‐19 serosurveillance was examined. A COVID‐19‐indected case was defined as showing positive results in both quantitative tests. None of 1404 samples had positive results from the two quantitative tests. The false positive rates were 0.36% and 0.07%, whereas those in rapid antibody kits were 3.3% and 3.0%. In conclusion, as of May, 2020, potential spread mainly by asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID‐19 was not found in our local area where there was no official report of COVID‐19, even if the PCR testing rate was low. Rapid antibody kits might not be useful due to the high false positive rate in an area with a low incidence of COVID‐19 infected individuals.","Nakamura, Akihiro; Ando, Sanae; Endo, Hideaki; Sato, Ryoichi",J Med Virol,432,5

However, information about the long-term complications affecting this population is lacking. AIMS: Investigation of long-term impact of COVID-19 in HCW. METHODS: Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated for the majority of HCW in an English teaching hospital 2 months following the peak of COVID-19 first wave. A questionnaire investigating the long-term complications was sent through global e-mail to HCW 4 months following the peak of the wave enquiring about the persistent health issues still affecting them at that point. RESULTS: Out of 3759 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 932 were positive (24%). Forty-five per cent of 138 HCW responding to the questionnaire reported persistent symptoms with 32% struggling to cope 3–4 months following the peak of the wave. Moderate-to-severe fatigue stood out as the most disabling symptom (39%) but mild-to-moderate shortness of breath, anxiety and sleep disturbance were almost universal in the subjects still struggling with symptoms. Only 16% consulted their general practitioner (GP) about their symptoms with only 2% taking sick leave after recovering from the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that about a third of HCW who responded to the survey were still struggling to cope with the symptoms of what is now known as long covid several months after the acute COVID-19 infections. The overwhelming majority of this group seem to be reluctant to neither seek medical advice nor take sick leave.","Gaber, T A-Z K; Ashish, A; Unsworth, A",Occup Med (Lond),432,16

It usually occurs in critically ill patients but it has also been implicated as a cause of cholecystitis in previously healthy individuals. In this subgroup of patients, infectious causes comprise the primary etiology. We, herein, discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in AAC, focusing on the infectious causes. AAC associated with critical medical conditions is caused by bile stasis and gallbladder ischemia. Several mechanisms are reported to be involved in AAC in patients without underlying critical illness including direct invasion of the gallbladder epithelial cells, gallbladder vasculitis, obstruction of the biliary tree, and sequestration. We emphasize that multiple pathogenic mechanisms may concurrently contribute to the development of AAC in varying degrees. Awareness of the implicated pathogens is essential since it will allow a more focused examination of the histopathological specimens. In conclusion, additional research and a high degree of clinical suspicion are needed to clarify the complex spectrum of mechanisms that are involved in the pathogenesis of AAC.","Markaki, Ioulia; Konsoula, Afroditi; Markaki, Lamprini; Spernovasilis, Nikolaos; Papadakis, Marios",World J Clin Cases,432,29

However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.","Martin, Ross; Li, Jiani; Parvangada, Aiyippa; Perry, Jason; Cihlar, Tomas; Mo, Hongmei; Porter, Danielle; Svarovskaia, Evguenia",Antiviral Res,432,20

It reflects a multidisciplinary research field and draws on findings from Web of Science Core Collection, up to April 2019. The empirical material consisted of 61 studies, whereof most were qualitative research, and some were of quantitative character, including very few dietary surveys. The findings show nine papers categorized as using quantitative approaches, 52 papers were categorized as qualitative. The results show a wide variety of different ways to try to find and understand how commensality can be understood and identified. There seems to be a shift in the very concept of commensality as well as some variations around the concept. This paper argues the need to further investigate the importance of commensality for health and wellbeing, as well as the need to gather data on health and health-related behaviors, living conditions and sociodemographic data in parallel. The review shows the broad-ranging areas where commensality is researched, from cultural and historical areas to ethnographic or anthropological areas over to dietary assessment. To complement large dietary surveys with methods of assessing who you are eating with in what environment should be a simple way to further our knowledge on the circumstances of meal intake and the importance of commensality. To add 24-h dietary recall to any study of commensality is another way of identifying the importance of commensality for dietary quality. The use of mixed methods research was encouraged by several authors as a good way forward in the assessment of commensality and its importance.","Scander, Henrik; Yngve, Agneta; Lennernäs Wiklund, Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,432,23

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and three measures of health (perceived general health, physical symptoms and sick days) in a group that is at high risk of sleep disturbance: hospital based health-care workers. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one nondepressed female hospital workers completed self-report measures of adult attachment, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms (excluding sleep-related items) and health outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation was tested with sequential regression analyses. RESULTS: Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impairment in global sleep quality (ρ=.20 and .19, respectively, P<.05) and physical symptoms (ρ=.21 and .19, P<.05). Attachment anxiety was also associated with depressive symptoms (ρ=.33, P<.001) and sick days (ρ=.21, P<.05). For both physical symptoms and sick days, mediation analyses were consistent with global sleep quality acting as a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and physical health. Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms were a stronger mediator. CONCLUSIONS: This study corroborates evidence that attachment insecurity is associated with sleep disturbance and extends this association to the occurrence of physical symptoms and time off work due to sickness among workers in a high-stress occupation.","Maunder, Robert G.; Hunter, Jonathan J.; Lancee, William J.",J Psychosom Res,432,26

Research efforts to develop antiviral agents against coronavirus demonstrated the main protease (Mpro) protein may represent effective drug target. X-ray crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV2 Mpro protein demonstrated the significance of Glu166, Cys141, and His41 residues involved in protein dimerization and its catalytic function. We performed in silico screening of compounds from Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae family) against Mpro protein inhibition. Employing a combination of molecular docking, scoring functions, and molecular dynamics simulations, 267 compounds were screened by docking on Mpro crystallographic structure. Docking score and interaction profile analysis exhibited strong binding on the Mpro catalytic domain with compounds C1 (1E,6E)-1,2,6,7-tetrahydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-dione) and C2 (4Z,6E)‐1,5‐dihydroxy‐1,7‐bis(4‐hydroxyphenyl)hepta‐4,6‐dien‐3‐one as lead agents. Compound C1 and C2 showed minimum binding score (–9.08 and –8.07 kcal/mole) against Mpro protein in comparison to shikonin and lopinavir (≈ −5.4 kcal/mole) a standard Mpro inhibitor. Furthermore, principal component analysis, free energy landscape and protein-ligand energy calculation studies revealed that these two compounds strongly bind to the catalytic core of the Mpro protein with higher efficacy than lopinavir, a standard antiretroviral of the protease inhibitor class. Taken together, this structure based optimization has provided lead on two natural Mpro inhibitors for further testing and development as therapeutics against human coronavirus.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors that are associated with pregnant women’s intentions to seek mental health services. We specifically assessed pregnant women who were at risk of mental health problems in mainland China. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted from February to March, 2020 among 19,515 pregnant women who were recruited from maternal health care centers across various regions of China. A subsample of 6248 pregnant women with probable depression (ie, those with a score of ≥10 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) or anxiety (ie, those with a score of ≥5 on the 7-item General Anxiety Disorder Scale) was included in our analysis. RESULTS: More than half (3292/6248, 52.7%) of the participants reported that they did not need mental health services. Furthermore, 28.3% (1770/6248) of participants felt that they needed mental health services, but had no intentions of seeking help, and only 19% (1186/6248) felt that they needed mental health services and had intentions of seek help. The results from our multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, education level, and gestational age were factors of not seeking help. However, COVID-19–related lockdowns in participants’ cities of residence, social support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in health care providers were protective factors of participants’ intentions to seek help from mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that promote seeking help for mental health problems among pregnant women should also promote social support from health care providers and trust between pregnant women and their care providers.","Wang, Qian; Song, Bo; Di, Jiangli; Yang, Xue; Wu, Anise; Lau, Joseph; Xin, Meiqi; Wang, Linhong; Mo, Phoenix Kit-Han",JMIR Ment Health,432,5

Audit results from Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.",17.657728,7.949122,2020-06-02,"Background: Various levels of lockdown implemented to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 are not long-term solutions due to socioeconomic implications. Methods: To inform safe reopening, we used an augmented SEIR model to project the impact of 1) interventions and potential new epidemic trajectories arising from super spreader (SS) events and/or international travel and 2) re-introducing strong behavioural interventions on resurgence trajectories. Results: Our model suggests that 50% behaviour intervention effectiveness (BIE) (from enforced social distancing during lockdown, early in the epidemic), along with 50% isolation intervention effectiveness (IIE) (from increased testing and isolating infected individuals) was achieved during lockdown, which curbed COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia. Post-lockdown, BIE plays a minimal role if IIE reaches or exceeds 46.9% when other variables are held constant. At IIE of 30% and BIE of 21.3%, SS events of 5,000 active cases risks COVID-19 resurgence, with 4-year projected 12.9mn cumulative cases and 1.1mn deaths. Earlier action to increase BIE to 50% on day 98 compared to day 111, prevented an additional 21,401 recovered cases and 257 deaths. Conclusion: Until a safe and effective vaccine is widely available, the risk of COVID-19 resurgence from large SS events warrants caution in decisions to allow for mass gatherings and regular international travel.","Ayub, A.

The proposed feature extractor is named as Local Dual Octal Pattern (LDOP). A novel LDOP based SSC method is presented to solve the low success rate problems for Munich-Passau Snore Sound Corpus (MPSSC) dataset. Multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition and the LDOP based feature generation, informative features selection with ReliefF and iterative neighborhood component analysis (RFINCA), and classification using k nearest neighbors (kNN) are fundamental phases of the proposed SSC method. Seven leveled DWT transform, and LDOP are used together to generate low, medium, and high levels features. This feature generation network extracts 4096 features in total. RFINCA selects 95 the most discriminative and informative ones of these 4096 features. In the classification phase, kNN with leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) is used. 95.53% classification accuracy and 94.65% unweighted average recall (UAR) have been achieved using this method. The proposed LDOP based SSC method reaches 22% better result than the best of the other state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning-based methods.

To protect medical laboratory personnel from infection, most laboratories inactivate the virus causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in clinical samples before testing. However, the effect of inactivation on the detection results remains unknown. Here, we used a digital PCR assay to determine the absolute SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in 63 nasopharyngeal swab samples and assess the effect of inactivation methods on viral RNA copy number. Viral inactivation was performed by three different methods: (i) incubation with the TRIzol LS reagent for 10 min at room temperature, (ii) heating in a water bath at 56°C for 30 min, and (iii) high-temperature treatment, including autoclaving at 121°C for 20 min, boiling at 100°C for 20 min, and heating at 80°C for 20 min. Compared to the amount of RNA in the original sample, TRIzol treatment destroyed 47.54% of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and 39.85% of open reading frame (ORF) 1ab. For samples treated at 56°C for 30 min, the copy number of the N gene and ORF 1ab was reduced by 48.55% and 56.40%, respectively. The viral RNA copy number dropped by 50 to 66% after heating at 80°C for 20 min. Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121°C or boiling at 100°C for 20 min. These results indicate that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false-negative results, especially in weakly positive cases. Thus, use of the TRIzol reagent rather than heat inactivation is recommended for sample inactivation, as the TRIzol reagent had the least effect on the RNA copy number among the tested methods.","Chen, Hailong; Wu, Rui; Xing, Yuan; Du, Quanli; Xue, Zerun; Xi, Yanli; Yang, Yujie; Deng, Yangni; Han, Yuewen; Li, Kaixin; Luan, Yang; Zhang, Yalan; Wei, Xiaoguang; Yu, Tongtong; Li, Hao; Zhu, Lingxiang; Su, Shisheng; Lian, Hao; Lu, Linping; Tan, Chianru; Zheng, Haichao; Chen, Baozhong; Yu, Pengbo; Guo, Yong; Ma, Chaofeng",J Clin Microbiol,432,16

Only M and N genes were analyzed in strain KU‐2 and strain 79–1683, which still had unknown nucleotide sequences. Deduced amino acid sequences of S, M and N proteins were compared in a total of 7 strains of coronaviruses, which included FIPV type II strain 79–1146, canine coronavirus (CCV) strain Insavc‐1 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) strain Purdue. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of M and N proteins revealed that both M and N proteins had an identity of at least 90% between FIPV type I and type II. The phylogenetic tree of the M and N protein‐deduced amino acid sequences showed that FIPV type I and type II form a group with FECV type II, and that these viruses were evolutionarily distant from CCV and TGEV. On the other hand, when the S protein‐deduced amino acid sequences was compared, identity of only about 45% was found between FIPV type I and type II. The phylogenetic tree of the S protein‐deduced amino acid sequences indicated that three strains of FIPV type I form a group, and that it is a very long distance from the FIPV type II, FECV type II, CCV and TGEV groups.","Motokawa, Kenji; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Hashimoto, Hiroshi; Koyama, Hiroyuki",Microbiol Immunol,432,30

We investigated whether empagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor) and gemigliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) improve inflammatory responses in macrophages, identified signalling pathways responsible for these effects, and studied whether the effects can be augmented with dual empagliflozin and gemigliptin therapy. METHODS: RAW 264.7 macrophages were first stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), then cotreated with empagliflozin, gemigliptin, or empagliflozin plus gemigliptin. We conducted quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine the most effective anti-inflammatory doses without cytotoxicity. We performed ELISA and qRT-PCR for inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and flow cytometry for CD80, the M1 macrophage surface marker, to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of empagliflozin and gemigliptin. NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK2/STAT signalling pathways were examined via Western blotting to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of anti-inflammation. RESULTS: LPS-stimulated CD80(+) M1 macrophages were suppressed by coincubation with empagliflozin, gemigliptin, and empagliflozin plus gemigliptin, respectively. Empagliflozin and gemigliptin (individually and combined) inhibited prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) release and COX-2, iNOS gene expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. These three treatments also attenuated the secretion and mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, and proinflammatory chemokines, such as CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CXCL10. All of them blocked NF-κB, JNK, and STAT1/3 phosphorylation through IKKα/β, MKK4/7, and JAK2 signalling. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of empagliflozin and gemigliptin via IKK/NF-κB, MKK7/JNK, and JAK2/STAT1 pathway downregulation in macrophages. In all cases, combined empagliflozin and gemigliptin treatment showed greater anti-inflammatory properties.","Lee, Nami; Heo, Yu Jung; Choi, Sung-E; Jeon, Ja Young; Han, Seung Jin; Kim, Dae Jung; Kang, Yup; Lee, Kwan Woo; Kim, Hae Jin",J Immunol Res,432,26

In Australia, life insurers’ use of genetic test results is legal and self-regulated by the insurance industry (Financial Services Council (FSC)). In 2018, an Australian Parliamentary Inquiry recommended that insurers’ use of genetic test results in underwriting should be prohibited. In 2019, the FSC introduced an industry self-regulated moratorium on the use of genetic test results. In the absence of government oversight, it is critical that the impact, effectiveness and appropriateness of the moratorium is monitored. Here we describe the protocol of our government-funded research project, which will serve that critical function between 2020 and 2023. METHODS: A realist evaluation framework was developed for the project, using a context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) approach, to systematically assess the impact of the moratorium for a range of stakeholders. Outcomes which need to be achieved for the moratorium to accomplish its intended aims were identified, and specific data collection measures methods were developed to gather the evidence from relevant stakeholder groups (consumers, health professionals, financial industry and genetic research community) to determine if aims are achieved. Results from each arm of the study will be analysed and published in peer-reviewed journals as they become available. DISCUSSION: The A-GLIMMER project will provide essential monitoring of the impact and effectiveness of the self-regulated insurance moratorium. On completion of the study (3 years) a Stakeholder Report will be compiled. The Stakeholder Report will synthesise the evidence gathered in each arm of the study and use the CMO framework to evaluate the extent to which each of the outcomes have been achieved, and make evidence-based recommendations to the Australian federal government, life insurance industry and other stakeholders.

This approach does not assume relevant political-economic aggregations ex ante (such as industries or ‘classes’); rather, it explores different possible ways of aggregating social groups and defining their interests depending on the situation under investigation. Moreover, interdependencies in the economy impose the need to keep conflicts within boundaries that are compatible with the viability of the system. Because sectors and groups can be aggregated in different ways, dynamics also depends on how actors represent the system and their position therein, and hence what they understand their interest to be. Different representations give rise to different definitions of competing interests and viability requirements, which in turn generates different endogenous dynamics of the political-economic system. The approach is illustrated through the examples of the Eurozone crisis and Covid-19 crisis.","Cardinale, Ivano; Landesmann, Michael",,432,24

METHODS: We included 273 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from February 10 to March 8, 2020. Clinical characteristics and risk factors for outcomes were compared between the young and middle-aged and the elderly severe patients. RESULTS: Hemoglobin, neutrophil percentage, inflammatory markers, hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular parameters differed between the non-elderly and elderly severe patients. In young and middle-aged patients, critical patients showed higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) during hospitalization than severe patients. However, in the elderly patients, critical patients showed decreased hsCRP during hospitalization and higher proBNP values. The hsCRP fluctuation and proBNP were independent risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in young and middle-aged severe patients (OR=1.068) and elderly severe patients (OR=1.026), respectively. CONCLUSION: The study revealed different potential causes of disease and predictive factors for non-elderly and elderly critical patients and treatment recommendations. Deterioration of inflammatory state was the main cause of ICU admission in young and middle-aged severe COVID-19 patients, while a decline in hsCRP was not associated with better outcomes in elderly severe patients, indicating the need for different treatments for non-elderly and elderly severe patients. Anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids should be considered in the early disease stage among non-elderly severe patients, but cardiovascular protection plays a more important role in elderly severe patients.","Liu, Zhelong; Wu, Danning; Han, Xia; Jiang, Wangyan; Qiu, Lin; Tang, Rui; Yu, Xuefeng",Int Immunopharmacol,432,33

Innate immune cells are critical for host defense but are also the primary drivers of ARDS. The relationships between innate cellular responses in ARDS resulting from COVID-19 compared to other causes of ARDS, such as bacterial sepsis is unclear. Moreover, the beneficial effects of dexamethasone therapy during severe COVID-19 remain speculative, but understanding the mechanistic effects could improve evidence-based therapeutic interventions. To interrogate these relationships, we developed an scRNA-Seq and plasma proteomics atlas (biernaskielab.ca/COVID_neutrophil). We discovered that compared to bacterial ARDS, COVID-19 was associated with distinct neutrophil polarization characterized by either interferon (IFN) or prostaglandin (PG) active states. Neutrophils from bacterial ARDS had higher expression of antibacterial molecules such as PLAC8 and CD83. Dexamethasone therapy in COVID patients rapidly altered the IFNactive state, downregulated interferon responsive genes, and activated IL1R2+ve neutrophils. Dexamethasone also induced the emergence of immature neutrophils expressing immunosuppressive molecules ARG1 and ANXA1, which were not present in healthy controls. Moreover, dexamethasone remodeled global cellular interactions by changing neutrophils from information receivers into information providers. Importantly, male patients had higher proportions of IFNactive neutrophils, a greater degree of steroid-induced immature neutrophil expansion, and increased mortality benefit compared to females in the dexamethasone era. Indeed, the highest proportion of IFNactive neutrophils was associated with mortality. These results define neutrophil states unique to COVID-19 when contextualized to other life-threatening infections, thereby enhancing the relevance of our findings at the bedside. Furthermore, the molecular benefits of dexamethasone therapy are also defined, and the identified pathways and plasma proteins can now be targeted to develop improved therapeutics.","Sinha, Sarthak; Rosin, Nicole L.; Arora, Rohit; Labit, Elodie; Jaffer, Arzina; Cao, Leslie; Farias, Raquel; Nguyen, Angela P.; de Almeida, Luiz G.

Therefore, it is necessary to look back and assess efficiency of each of the first wave restrictions, so that interventions can now be more finely tuned.

A total of 8,476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after an aggressive mRNA vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a multiplex antigen microarray containing 10 SARS-CoV-2 antigens, 4 SARS, 3 MERS, 12 Common CoV, and 8 Influenza antigens. Twenty-six percent of 3,347 specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The Ab response was predominantly against nucleocapsid (NP), full length spike and the spike S2 domain. Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and there was no cross-reactivity against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. An aggressive mRNA vaccination campaign at the UCI Medical Center started on December 16, 2020 and 6,724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. Seroprevalence increased from 13% in December to 79% in January, 93% in February and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced much higher Ab levels especially against the RBD domain and significant cross-reactivity against SARS RBD and S1 was also observed. Nucleocapsid protein Abs can be used to distinguish individuals in a population of vaccinees to classify those who have been previously infected and those who have not, because nucleocapsid is not in the vaccine. Previously infected individuals developed higher Ab titers to the vaccine than those who have not been previously exposed. These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much stronger and broader Ab response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Assis, Rafael; Jain, Aarti; Nakajima, Rie; Jasinskas, Al; Kahn, Saahir; Palma, Anton; Parker, Daniel M.; Chau, Anthony; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Muqolli, Fjolla; Khalil, Ghali; Escobar, Jessica Colin; Ventura, Jenny; Davies, D.

We present a nested approach for quantifying the importance of host and vectors that integrates species’ physiological competence with their ecological traits. We apply this framework to a medically important arbovirus, Ross River virus (RRV), in Brisbane, Australia. We find that vertebrate hosts with high physiological competence are not the most important for community transmission; interactions between hosts and vectors largely underpin the importance of host species. For vectors, physiological competence is highly important. Our results identify primary and secondary vectors of RRV and suggest two potential transmission cycles in Brisbane: an enzootic cycle involving birds and an urban cycle involving humans. The framework accounts for uncertainty from each fitted statistical model in estimates of species’ contributions to transmission and has has direct application to other zoonotic pathogens.","Kain, Morgan P; Skinner, Eloise B; van den Hurk, Andrew F; McCallum, Hamish; Mordecai, Erin A",eLife,432,10

Active RFID tags are attached to individuals and assets in the wards. Active RFID readers communicate with the tags continuously and automatically to keep track of the real-time information about the locations of the tagged objects. The data regarding the locations and other transmitted information are stored in the ward management system. This platform enables capabilities of real-time monitoring and tracking of individuals and assets, reporting of ward statistics, and providing intelligence and analytics for hospital ward management. All of these capabilities benefit hospital ward management by enhanced patient safety, increased operational efficiency and throughput, and mitigation of risk of infectious disease widespread. A prototype developed based on our proposed architecture of the platform was tested in a pilot study, which was conducted in two medical wards of the intensive care unit of one of the largest public general hospitals in Hong Kong. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of the implementation of this RFID-enabled platform for practical use in hospital wards.

They also express their 3′ region proteins from a nested set of 3′ co-terminal subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs). Some but not all of the Nidovirus sg mRNAs also have a common 5′ leader sequence that is acquired by a discontinuous RNA synthesis mechanism regulated by multiple 3′ body transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) and the 5′ leader TRS. Initial studies detected a single major body TRS for each 3′ sg mRNA with a few alternative functional TRSs reported. The recent application of advanced techniques, such as next generation sequencing and ribosomal profiling, in studies of arteriviruses and coronaviruses has revealed an expanded sg mRNA transcriptome and coding capacity.","Di, Han; McIntyre, Ayisha A.; Brinton, Margo A.",Virology,432,22

Elucidation of the kinetics and duration of the humoral response is important for clinical management and interpreting results from serological surveys. OBJECTIVES: : Here we evaluated the clinical performance of Abbott SARSCoV-2 IgM and IgG assays, as well as the longitudinal dynamics of the antibody response in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: The diagnostic specificity was 100% for IgM and 99.67% for IgG using 300 pre-COVID-19 serum specimens. Using 1349 sequential serum samples collected up to 168 days post symptom onset from 427 PCR-confirmed individuals, clinical test sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgM assay was 24.6% at ≤7 days, 75.3% at 8-14 days, 95.0% at 15-21 days, and 96.0% at 4-5 weeks (peak test sensitivity). The median duration of time for IgM seroconversion was 10 days. IgM levels declined steadily 4-5 weeks after symptom onset, and the positive rate dropped to 30.8% at >3 months. The diagnostic sensitivity for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay post symptom onset was 23.2% at ≤7 days, 69.5% at 8-14 days, 93.6% at 15-21 days, and 99.6% at 4-5 weeks (peak test sensitivity). The median duration of time for IgG seroconversion was 11.5 days. During the convalescent phase of the infection, a decline in the IgG level was observed in patients who were followed for >100 days. Despite that decline, 92.3% of the patient cohort remained IgG positive 3-6 months following symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the Abbott IgM assay against SARSCoV-2 is detected slightly earlier compared to IgG, with both tests exhibiting excellent overall sensitivity and specificity. In symptomatic patients who test negative by PCR for a SARS-CoV-2 infection, assessing IgM and IgG antibodies can aid in supporting a diagnosis of COVID-19.","Maine, Gabriel N.; Lao, Kriselle Maris; Krishnan, Subhashree Mallika; Afolayan-Oloye, Olabisi; Fatemi, Seyedalireza; Kumar, Sandeep; VanHorn, Lindsay; Hurand, Ashley; Sykes, Elizabeth; Sun, Qian",J Clin Virol,432,20

The model includes both asymptomatic and presymptomatic populations with the latter leading to sickness (with recovery, hospitalization and death possibilities). We consider the situation involving the imposed application of partial social distancing measures in the time series of interest and find optimal parametric fits to the time series of deaths (only), as well as to that of deaths and cumulative infections. We discuss the merits and disadvantages of each approach, we interpret the parameters of the model and assess the realistic nature of the parameters resulting from the optimization procedure. Importantly, we explore a model involving two sub-populations (younger and older than a specific age), to more accurately reflect the observed impact as concerns symptoms and behavior in different age groups. For definitiveness and to separate people that are (typically) in the active workforce, our partition of population is with respect to members younger vs. older than the age of 65. The basic reproductive number of the model is computed for both the single- and the two-population variant. Finally, we consider what would be the impact on the number of deaths and cumulative infections upon imposition of partial lockdown (involving only the older population) and full lockdown (involving the entire population).","Cuevas-Maraver, JesÃºs; Kevrekidis, Panayotis; Chen, Qian-Yong; Kevrekidis, George; Villalobos-Daniel, VÃ­ctor; Rapti, Zoi; Drossinos, Yannis",,432,16

We analysed data from putative household infector infectee pairs in the Virus Watch Community cohort study to assess the serial interval of COVID-19 and whether this was affected by emergence of the B.1.17 variant. Methods The Virus Watch study is an online, prospective, community cohort study following up entire households in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Putative household infector infectee pairs were identified where more than one person in the household had a positive swab matched to an illness episode. Data on whether individual infections were caused by the B.1.1.7 variant were not available. We therefore developed a classification system based on the percentage of cases estimated to be due to B.1.17 in national surveillance data for different English regions and study weeks. Results Out of 24,887 illnesses reported, 915 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 186 likely infector infectee pairs in 186 households amongst 372 individuals were identified. The mean COVID-19 serial interval was 3.18 (95%CI: 2.55;3.81) days. There was no significant difference (p=0.267) between the mean serial interval for Variants of Concern (VOC) hotspots (mean = 3.64 days, (95%CI: 2.55;4.73)) days and non-VOC hotspots, (mean = 2.72 days, (95%CI: 1.48;3.96)). Conclusions Our estimates of the average serial interval of COVID-19 are broadly similar to estimates from previous studies and we find no evidence that B.1.1.7 is associated with a change in serial intervals. Alternative explanations such as increased viral load, longer period of viral shedding or improved receptor binding may instead explain the increased transmissibility and rapid spread and should undergo further investigation.","Geismar, C.

Our aim was to identify the most conserved and immunogenic antigens of S. pyogenes, which can be a potential candidate for vaccine design in the future. Eight important surface proteins were analyzed. Using different prediction servers, strongest epitopes were selected. They had the ability to stimulate the humoral and cell-mediated immune system. Molecular docking was performed for measuring free-binding energy of selected epitopes. Seven epitopes from three surface proteins were selected as potential candidates for vaccine development. Conservation of selected epitopes among different Streptococcus types was checked.

Material y Métodos: Se realizó una revisión sistemática (RS) y metaanálisis (MA) de trabajos publicados previamente. La estrategia de búsqueda incluyó todos los descriptores conocidos sobre Covid-19 y tabaco y se realizó en diferentes bases de datos. Se utilizaron modelos estadísticos adecuados para abordar el tamaño del efecto en un metaanálisis: modelo de efectos aleatorios y de efectos fijos. Resultados: Fueron identificados 34 artículos en la RS de los cuáles fueron incluidos 19 en el MA. Ser fumador o ex fumador se mostró como un factor de riesgo para una peor progresión de la infección por Covid-19 (OR 1,96 IC 95%, 1,36 – 2,83) y una mayor probabilidad de presentar una condición más crítica de la infección (OR 1,79 IC 95%, 1,19 – 2,70). Como limitaciones del MA encontramos que la mayoría de los estudios analizados eran observacionales con un sesgo de publicación limitado y con dos estudios discrepantes con el resto, aunque tras retirarlos del MA se mantenía el tabaco como un factor de riesgo de peor evolución. Conclusión: El tabaquismo actual y pasado produce una forma clínica más grave de la Covid-19 y lleva con mayor frecuencia a estos pacientes a ingresar en cuidados intensivos, sean intubados y mueran. ABTRACT Objective: The aim of this study was to determine if tobacco use in patients with Covid-19 is associated with a negative disease course and adverse outcome, and if smoking, current and past, is associated with a greater possibility of developing COVID-19. Material and Methods: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) of previously published works were performed. The search strategy included all known descriptors for Covid-19 and tobacco and was conducted in different databases. Appropriate statistical models were used to address the effect size in meta-analysis, namely random effects and fixed effects model. Results: Thirty-four articles were identified in the SR of which 19 were included in the MA. Being a smoker or former smoker was shown to be a risk factor for worse progression of Covid-19 infection (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 - 2.83) and a greater probability of presenting a more critical condition (OR 1.79 95% CI, 1.19 - 2.70). As limitations of the MA, we found that most of the studies analyzed were observational with limited publication bias. Two studies that disagreed with the rest were included, although after withdrawing them from the MA, smoking was maintained as a risk factor for worse progress. Conclusion: Current and past smoking produces a more serious clinical form of Covid-19 and more frequently leads to intensive care admission, intubation, and death.","Jiménez-Ruiz, Carlos A.; López-Padilla, Daniel; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael; Solano-Reina, Segismundo; de Granda-Orive, José Ignacio",Arch Bronconeumol,432,20

MAIN BODY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently occurring pandemic over world. It was emerged in Wuhan, China, in the end of December 2019 and spreading across worldwide. As the coronavirus is spreading easily through direct contact with infected people droplets, inhalation, and also air droplets, it hit up a huge amount of population even reported with death. Still, with small amounts of asymptomatic transmission between people it spreads throughout the globe. People need special care to protect from the transmission of disease. However, there are no drugs so far that shows efficacy; there is an immediate need for the development of vaccines. In order to decrease the COVID-19 cases, organizations rapidly involve in the preparation of vaccine and many vaccines have been developed by various countries.

We recruited 138 consecutive pregnant women attending for first trimester screening (11‐13 weeks of gestation) at Sant'Anna Hospital, Turin, Piedmont, Italy, during the plateau and the falling phase of the COVID‐19 epidemic curve. Patients were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 IgM/IgG antibody levels and SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in sera and nasopharyngeal swab samples.

Other cell types present the receptor and can be infected, including cardiac, renal, intestinal, and endothelial cells. High ACE2 levels protect from inflammation. Despite the relevance of ACE2 levels in COVID-19 pathogenesis, experimental studies to comprehensively address the question of ACE2 regulations are still limited. A relevant observation from the clinic is that, besides the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1β, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is also elevated in worse prognosis patients. This could represent somehow a “danger signal”, an alarmin from the host organism, given the immuno-regulatory properties of the cytokine. Here, we investigated whether IL-10 could increase ACE2 expression in the lung-derived Calu-3 cell line. We provided preliminary evidence of ACE2 mRNA increase in cells of lung origin in vitro, following IL-10 treatment. Endothelial cell infection by SARS-COV-2 is associated with vasculitis, thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We confirmed ACE2 expression enhancement by IL-10 treatment also on endothelial cells. The sartans (olmesartan and losartan) showed non-statistically significant ACE2 modulation in Calu-3 and endothelial cells, as compared to untreated control cells. We observed that the antidiabetic biguanide metformin, a putative anti-inflammatory agent, also upregulates ACE2 expression in Calu-3 and endothelial cells. We hypothesized that IL-10 could be a danger signal, and its elevation could possibly represent a feedback mechanism fighting inflammation. Although further confirmatory studies are required, inducing IL-10 upregulation could be clinically relevant in COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and vasculitis, by reinforcing ACE2 levels.","Albini, Adriana; Calabrone, Luana; Carlini, Valentina; Benedetto, Nadia; Lombardo, Michele; Bruno, Antonino; Noonan, Douglas M.",Front Immunol,432,1

Additionally, resident physicians considered patients under investigation (PUI) were furloughed from clinical practice. The necessity for supplemental learning in a virtual setting prompted the development of an online homeschooling curriculum that incorporated back to the basics textbook learning, application, and retention via virtual sessions for the quarantined and furloughed learners. Methods An online homeschooling curriculum was developed to replace the cancelled clinical experiences for EM residents and for those who were quarantined utilizing Google Classroom and Zoom teleconference software. After completion of their quarantine or return to normal rotation schedule, residents were asked to evaluate the homeschooling curriculum using an anonymous survey. Results A total of 12 residents participated in the homeschooling program over eight weeks during the spring of 2020. Of the nine residents surveyed, 88.8% percent felt the homeschooling added to their knowledge of EM, 100% found the online format easy to use, and 88.8% stated it helped maintain a sense of social connection to peers and faculty. Conclusion An online homeschooling program was considered an effective means of providing an opportunity for synchronous and continuous education for EM resident physicians. This program could be sustainable long term to fill in knowledge gaps or supplement remediation in emergency resident education, post pandemic.","Sielicki, Anthony; White, Jennifer; Berman, Mitchell; Lao, Belinda; Stobart-Gallagher, Megan",Cureus,432,15

We discuss the prospective behavioral and biological differences between the sexes that could be attributed to this sex-based differentiation. The female sex hormones and the immune stimulatory genes, including Toll-like receptors, interleukins, and micro-RNAs present on X-chromosome, may impart lesser infectivity and mortality of the SARS-CoV-2 in females over males. The sex hormone estrogen interacts with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, one of the most critical pathways in COVID-19 infectivity, and modulates the vasomotor homeostasis. Testosterone on the contrary enhances the levels of the two most critical molecules, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine-type 2 (TMPRSS2), transcriptionally and posttranslationally, thereby increasing viral load and delaying viral clearance in men as compared with women. We propose that modulating sex hormones, either by increasing estrogen or antiandrogen, may be a therapeutic option to reduce mortality from SARS-CoV-2.","Chanana, Neha; Palmo, Tsering; Sharma, Kavita; Kumar, Rahul; Graham, Brian B.; Pasha, Qadar",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,432,16

One of the most impacted areas were the medical and dental education fields, due to the forced break from clinical practice during the lockdown, which affected both the educational part, as well as the patients. Thus, the main goal of our research was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dental students’ education as related to their perceptions and evaluations, in Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 878 dental students who reported their perception of the psychological and educational impact of this period by completing a Google Forms questionnaire. Collected data were statistically analyzed using Stata/IC 16. There was a severe psychological impact among the respondents, the levels of stress being perceived as high and very high (33.83%, n = 297; 28.59%, n = 251), similar to high and very high anxiety feelings (26.54%, n = 233; 24.26%, n = 213). Very high educational impact from the point of view of the acquisition of practical skills (48.52%, n = 426) and future professional perspectives (38.95%, n = 342) were recorded. While online theoretical learning ability was principally low (37.93%, n = 333) despite consistently modified time allocated to the individual study (44.35%, n = 389), most of the students evaluated the efficiency of lecturers in online courses as neutral (41.12%, n = 361). New dentistry teaching programs will have to be adopted taking into account the dynamics of the pandemic and its strong impact on our students, in order to improve both their wellbeing and the sustainability of dental education.","Iosif, Laura; Ţâncu, Ana Maria Cristina; Didilescu, Andreea Cristiana; Imre, Marina; Gălbinașu, Bogdan Mihai; Ilinca, Radu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,432,1

Sus signos habituales son obstrucción nasal, rinorrea, estornudos, dolor faríngeo y tos. Los autores anglosajones hablan de catarro (common cold) o de infección de vías respiratorias altas para describir una inflamación de las vías respiratorias superiores, y de adenoiditis crónica (chronic adenoiditis) para designar una infección crónica de las vegetaciones adenoides que produce rinorrea febril recidivante u obstrucción de las vías respiratorias altas. Las rinofaringitis agudas no complicadas son de origen vírico. Habitualmente su evolución espontánea es rápida y sin complicaciones. Por tanto, no hay que obtener muestras bacteriológicas ni hacer un tratamiento antibiótico sistemático. Como tratamiento de primera línea, sólo precisan analgésicos y antipiréticos asociados a lavados de las fosas nasales con suero salino isotónico o hipertónico. Las complicaciones de las rinofaringitis son infecciosas –representadas esencialmente por las otitis y las sinusitis– y respiratorias obstructivas. El carácter a menudo repetitivo de las rinofaringitis a partir de los 6 meses de edad refleja un proceso fisiológico de maduración del sistema inmunitario. Cuando existen rinofaringitis frecuentes e invalidantes, los principales factores de riesgo que se deben buscar, y de ser posible erradicar, son el tabaquismo pasivo y los contactos con una población infantil. La adenoidectomía ya no está indicada si no existen complicaciones.

Several observational studies have reported that cancer is a risk factor for COVID-19. On the other hand, ACE2, a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was found to be aberrantly expressed in many tumors. However, the characterization of aberrant ACE2 expression in malignant tumors has not been elucidated. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of the ACE2 expression profile across 31 types of tumors. METHODS: Distribution of ACE2 expression was analyzed using the GTEx, CCLE, TCGA pan-cancer databases. We evaluated the effect of ACE2 on clinical prognosis using the Kaplan-Meier survival plot and COX regression analysis. Correlation between ACE2 and immune infiltration levels was investigated in various cancer types. Additionally, the correlation between ACE2 and immune neoantigen, TMB, microsatellite instability, Mismatch Repair Genes (MMRs), HLA gene members, and DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) was investigated. The frequency of ACE2 gene mutation in various tumors was analyzed. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted in various cancer types using the GSEA method. RESULTS: In normal tissues, ACE2 was highly expressed in almost all 31 organs tested. In cancer cell lines, the expression level of ACE2 was low to medium. Although aberrant expression was observed in most cancer types, high expression of ACE2 was not linked to OS, DFS, RFS, and DFI in most tumors in TCGA pan-cancer data. We found that ACE2 expression was significantly correlated with the infiltrating levels of macrophages and dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells in multiple tumors. A positive correlation between ACE2 expression and immune neoantigen, TMB, and microsatellite instability was found in multiple cancers. GSEA analysis which was carried out to determine the effect of ACE2 on tumors indicated that several cancer-associated pathways and immune-related pathways were hyperactivated in the high ACE2 expression group of most tumors. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ACE2 is not correlated with prognosis in most cancer types. However, elevated ACE2 is significantly correlated with immune infiltrating levels, including those of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs in multiple cancers, especially in lung and breast cancer patients. These findings suggest that ACE2 may affect the tumor environment in cancer patients with COVID-19.","Song, Jukun; Han, Jing; Liu, Feng; Chen, Xianlin; Qian, Shenqi; Wang, Yadong; Jia, Zhenyu; Duan, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Xiangyan; Zhu, Jianguo",Front Mol Biosci,432,26

Usually detection of coronavirus including SARS-CoV-2 was detected by real-time RT-PCR method, but it must be long time that RNA is treated by extraction, concentration and purification, and detected by RT-PCR method. We modified various methods, of which evaluated if each method is short and simple enough. In one point of the evaluations, real-time RT-PCR could be finished in very short time with using mobile real-time PCR device PCR1100 (Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd.). It was able to detect positive control RNA for 20 minutes by each method according to the National Institute of Infections Disease in Japan (NIID), and less than 13.5 minutes according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in USA (CDC). In another point of the evaluations, surprisingly, Human coronavirus 229E, which was substituted for SARS-CoV-2, could be detected in crude state without treatment in advance of RNA. As that was, it was possible to detect coronavirus with direct RT-PCR. Therefore, it might eliminate wasteful time, avoid secondary infection and risk of contamination. In light of the above two points, SARS-CoV-2 might be detected more quickly and more simply. With using this mobile real-time PCR, these methods should be suitable for not only SARS-CoV-2 but also other various viruses and might save time compared to earlier detection methods.","Muraoka, M.; Tanoi, Y.; Tada, T.; Mizukoshi, M.; Kawaguchi, O.",,432,21

We study this problem in the linear and nonlinear regimes, both theoretically and numerically, for the case of a pitchfork bifurcation with fluctuating growth rate. We compute the stationary distribution analytically and numerically from the associated fractional Fokker-Planck equation in the Stratonovich interpretation. We characterize the system in the parameter space $(\alpha,\beta)$ of the noise, with stability parameter $\alpha\in (0,2)$ and skewness parameter $\beta\in[-1,1]$. Five regimes are identified in this parameter space, in addition to the well-studied Gaussian case $\alpha=2$. Three regimes are located at $1<\alpha<2$, where the noise has finite mean but infinite variance. They are differentiated by $\beta$ and all display a critical transition at the deterministic instability threshold, with on-off intermittency close to onset. Critical exponents are computed from the stationary distribution. Each regime is characterized by a specific form of the density and specific critical exponents, which differ starkly from the Gaussian case. A finite or infinite number of integer-order moments may converge, depending on parameters. Two more regimes are found at $0<\alpha\leq 1$. There, the mean of the noise diverges, and no critical transition occurs. In one case the origin is always unstable, independently of the distance $\mu$ from the deterministic threshold. In the other case, the origin is conversely always stable, independently of $\mu$. We thus demonstrate that an instability subject to non-equilibrium, power-law-distributed fluctuations can display substantially different properties than for Gaussian thermal fluctuations, in terms of statistics and critical behavior.","Kan, Adrian van; Alexakis, Alexandros; Brachet, Marc-Etienne",Physical review.

Among compounds proposed to fight the SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), already effective in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have been proposed on the basis of their antiviral action already demonstrated against SARS-CoV-1. Very few cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ph+ ALL and in CML Italian cohorts; authors suggested that this low rate of infections might depend on the use of TKIs, but the biological causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, the CML model was used to test if TKIs would sustain or not the viral replication and if they could damage patient immunity. Firstly, the infection and replication rate of torquetenovirus (TTV), whose load is inversely proportional to the host immunological control, have been measured in CML patients receiving nilotinib. A very low percentage of subjects were infected at baseline, and TTV did not replicate or at least showed a low replication rate during the follow-up, with a mean load comparable to the measured one in healthy subjects. Then, after gene expression profiling experiments, we found that several “antiviral” genes, such as CD28 and IFN gamma, were upregulated, while genes with “proviral” action, such as ARG-1, CEACAM1, and FUT4, were less expressed during treatment with imatinib, thus demonstrating that TKIs are not detrimental from the immunological point of view. To sum up, our data could offer some biological explanations to the low COVID-19 occurrence in Ph+ ALL and CML patients and sustain the use of TKIs in COVID-19, as already proposed by several international ongoing studies.","Galimberti, Sara; Petrini, Mario; Baratè, Claudia; Ricci, Federica; Balducci, Serena; Grassi, Susanna; Guerrini, Francesca; Ciabatti, Elena; Mechelli, Sandra; Di Paolo, Antonello; Baldini, Chiara; Baglietto, Laura; Macera, Lisa; Spezia, Pietro Giorgio; Maggi, Fabrizio",Front Oncol,432,0

However, there are no systematic studies describe the molecular genetic evolution and migration of LNVs. With the development of bioinformatics, viral genetic data combining the information of virus isolation time and locations could be integrated to infer the virus evolution and spread in nature. METHODS: Here, a phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations was conducted on the LNVs isolated from a variety of vectors during 1990–2014 to identify the evolution and migration patterns of LNVs. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the LNV could be divided into 3 genotypes, of which genotype 1 mainly composed of LNVs isolated from Australia during 1990 to 2014 and the original LNV strain (LNV-NE97–31) isolated from Liaoning province in northern China in 1997, genotype 2 comprised of the isolates all from Xinjiang province in western China and genotype 3 consisted the isolates from Qinghai and Shanxi province of central China. LNVs emerged about 272 years ago and gradually evolved into three lineages in the order genotype 1, genotype 2 and genotype 3. Following phylogeographic analysis, it shows genotype 1 LNVs transmitted from Australia (113°E-153°E,10°S-42°S) to Liaoning province (118°E-125°E,38°N-43°N) in Northeast Asian continent then further spread across the central part of China to western China (75°E-95°E,35°N-50°N). CONCLUSION: LNVs were initially isolated from Liaoning province of China in the Northeast Asia, however, the present study revealed that LNVs were first appeared in Australia in the South Pacific region and transmitted to mainland China then rapidly spread across China and evolved three different genotypes. The above results suggested that LNV had the characteristics of long-distance transmission and there were great genetic diversity existed in the LNV population. Notably, current information of 80 strains of LNVs are limited. It is of great importance to strengthen the surveillance of LNVs to explore its real origin in nature and monitoring of the LNVs’ population variation and maintain vigilance to avoid LNV breaking through the species barrier and further clarify its relationship to human and animal infection.","Zhang, Jun; Liu, Hong; Wang, Jiahui; Wang, Jiheng; Zhang, Jianming; Wang, Jiayue; Zhang, Xin; Ji, Hongfang; Ding, Zhongfeng; Xia, Han; Zhang, Chunyang; Zhao, Qian; Liang, Guodong",Virol J,432,26

One key missing component of the risk-benefit analysis of using such vaccines is the risk of these severe thrombotic events following COVID-19. METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort study based on electronic health records primarily in the USA, the absolute risks of CVT and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in the two weeks following a diagnosis of COVID-19 (made between January 20, 2020 and March 25, 2021) were calculated.

OBJECTIVE: The goals of the research were development and usability evaluation of an application, SleepFit, for ecological momentary assessment of objective and subjective clinical metrics at PD patients’ homes, and as a remote tool for researchers to monitor patients and integrate and manage data. METHODS: An iterative and user-centric strategy was employed for the development of SleepFit. The core structure of SleepFit consists of (1) an electronic finger-tapping test; (2) motor, sleepiness, and emotional subjective scales; and (3) a sleep diary. Applicable design, ergonomic, and navigation principles have been applied while tailoring the application to the specific patient population. Three progressively enhanced versions of the application (alpha, v1.0, v2.0) were tested by a total of 56 patients with PD who were asked to perform multiple home assessments 4 times per day for 2 weeks. Patient compliance was calculated as the proportion of completed tasks out of the total number of expected tasks. Satisfaction on the latest version (v2.0) was evaluated as potential willingness to use SleepFit again after the end of the study. RESULTS: From alpha to v1.0, SleepFit was improved in graphics, ergonomics, and navigation, with automated flows guiding the patients in performing tasks throughout the 24 hours, and real-time data collection and consultation were made possible thanks to a remote web portal. In v2.0, the kiosk-mode feature restricts the use of the tablet to the SleepFit application only, thus preventing users from accidentally exiting the application. A total of 52 (4 dropouts) patients were included in the analyses. Overall compliance (all versions) was 88.89% (5707/6420). SleepFit was progressively enhanced and compliance increased from 87.86% (2070/2356) to 89.92% (2899/3224; P=.04). Among the patients who used v2.0, 96% (25/26) declared they would use SleepFit again. CONCLUSIONS: SleepFit can be considered a state-of-the-art home-based system that increases compliance in PD patients, ensures high-quality data collection, and works as a handy tool for remote monitoring and data management in clinical research. Thanks to its user-friendliness and modular structure, it could be employed in other clinical studies with minimum adaptation efforts.

This had a significant impact on young athletes and their families in relation to their psycho-social, physical and career progression considerations. The disruption is likely to continue for some years, considering the constraints of lockdowns, the need to overcome dysfunctional national logistics for delivery of medical care, fund and implement an efficacious vaccine programme locally, nationally and worldwide, develop sufficient herd immunity and create an environment of confidence in the safety of returning to sports for participants, coaches, umpires, administrators and observers. This article will consider the interim challenges regarding the physical and psychosocial importance of maintaining an active sporting programme for young athletes, reflect on safety measures for modifying sporting equipment and environmental protections to allow safest participation in training and competition and provide advice on protocols for a gradual return to sport for the young athlete after infection with Covid-19.","Fitzgerald, Hugh T.; Rubin, Sam T.; Fitzgerald, Dominic A.; Rubin, Bruce K.",Paediatr Respir Rev,432,1

Until now, many drugs and methods have been used in the treatment of the disease. However, no effective treatment option has been found and only case-based successes have been achieved so far. This study aims to evaluate COVID-19 treatment options using multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the available COVID-19 treatment options by MCDM techniques, namely, fuzzy PROMETHEE and VIKOR. These techniques are based on the evaluation and comparison of complex and multiple criteria to evaluate the most appropriate alternative. We evaluated current treatment options including favipiravir (FPV), lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, interleukin-1 blocker, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchange. The criteria used for the analysis include side effects, method of administration of the drug, cost, turnover of plasma, level of fever, age, pregnancy, and kidney function. RESULTS: The results showed that plasma exchange was the most preferred alternative, followed by FPV and IVIG, while hydroxychloroquine was the least favorable one. New alternatives could be considered once they are available, and weights could be assigned based on the opinions of the decision-makers (physicians/clinicians). The treatment methods that we evaluated with MCDM methods will be beneficial for both healthcare users and to rapidly end the global pandemic. The proposed method is applicable for analyzing the alternatives to the selection problem with quantitative and qualitative data. In addition, it allows the decision-maker to define the problem simply under uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Fuzzy PROMETHEE and VIKOR techniques are applied in aiding decision-makers in choosing the right treatment technique for the management of COVID-19.","Yildirim, Figen Sarigul; Sayan, Murat; Sanlidag, Tamer; Uzun, Berna; Ozsahin, Dilber Uzun; Ozsahin, Ilker",J Healthc Eng,432,0

The clinical course among non‐pregnant women has been described but data about potential risks for women and their fetus remain scarce. The SARS and MERS epidemics were responsible for miscarriages, adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes and maternal deaths. For COVID‐19 infection, only 9 cases of maternal death have been reported as of April 22, 2020 and pregnant women seem to develop the same clinical presentation as the general population. However, severe maternal cases, as well as prematurity, fetal distress and stillbirth among newborns have been reported. The SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic greatly impacts prenatal management and surveillance and raise the need for clear unanimous guidelines. In this narrative review, we describe the current knowledge about coronaviruses (SARS, MERS and SARS‐CoV‐2) risks and consequences on pregnancies and we summarize available current candidate therapeutic options for pregnant women.

To prevent delay of beginning low vision ocular rehabilitation services, all low vision care was switched to telerehabilitation to home. Methods: Case managers began to cancel all in-person services and offer Veterans Affairs (VA) video connect services to their home. Patients with video access scheduled a home VA video connect telerehabilitation evaluation and therapy assessment. Patients who did not have video access waited to schedule a future in-person low vision appointment (postpandemic). Results: Of the in-person canceled appointments, 54% who scheduled the new home telerehabilitation evaluation were delayed on average 25 calendar days. Patients who waited for in-person low vision care were delayed on average 98, 138, or 153 calendar days. Of the 56 new patients referred for low vision optometry services during this 4-month period (COVID-19), 91% scheduled home low vision ocular telerehabilitation evaluations without delay; 5% waited until in-person clinics were open; and 4% waited until rural VA's and community-based outpatient centers were open. Discussion: Veterans with low vision who live in rural communities have limited access to services unless they are able to travel several miles to a specialty low vision clinic. Low vision ocular rehabilitation telehealth services have been successfully provided at the VA Western New York Healthcare System (Buffalo, NY) low vision clinic. Conclusions: Home low vision ocular rehabilitation telehealth increases access as early as possible once diagnosed with ocular pathology resulting in low vision.","Ihrig, Carolyn",Telemed. j. e. health,432,3

The selection of peptides for ex vivo CD8+ T cell detection is critical because within a complex antigen exists a multitude of potential epitopes that can be presented by HLA class I molecules. Further complicating this task, there is HLA class I polygenism and polymorphism which predisposes CD8+ T cell responses towards individualized epitope recognition profiles. In this study, we compare the actual CD8+ T cell recognition of a well-characterized model antigen, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pp65 protein, with its anticipated epitope coverage. Due to the abundance of experimentally defined HLA-A(*)02:01-restricted pp65 epitopes, and because in silico epitope predictions are most advanced for HLA-A(*)02:01, we elected to focus on subjects expressing this allele. In each test subject, every possible CD8+ T cell epitope was systematically covered testing 553 individual peptides that walk the sequence of pp65 in steps of single amino acids. Highly individualized CD8+ T cell response profiles with aleatory epitope recognition patterns were observed. No correlation was found between epitopes’ ranking on the prediction scale and their actual immune dominance. Collectively, these data suggest that accurate CD8+ T cell immune monitoring may necessitate reliance on agnostic mega peptide pools, or brute force mapping, rather than electing individual peptides as representative epitopes for tetramer and other multimer labeling of surface antigen receptors.","Lehmann, Alexander A.; Zhang, Ting; Reche, Pedro A.; Lehmann, Paul V.",Front Immunol,432,1

The sequence contained an open-reading frame that could encode a basic protein of mol.wt. 49700. From the predicted sequence it was apparent that the nucleocapsid protein has 5 basic regions, two of which are located near the middle of the sequence, a serine-rich region was also located, a feature which may be of functional importance as the nucleocapsid protein is phosphorylated at serine residues. The carboxy terminus of the nucleocapsid protein was found to be acidic.

Phylogenetic analysis of the S2 gene nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data resulted in groups of strains that were the same as groupings observed when S1 sequence data was used. Thus, it appears that S2 subunits are conserved within a serotype but not between serotypes. Although the sequence differences were small, we found that only a few amino acid differences were responsible for different secondary structure predictions for the S2 subunit. It is likely that these changes create different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits, which could affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotype specific epitopes are located. Based on this sequence data, we hypothesize that the S2 subunit can affect specific antibody binding to the S1 subunit of the IBV spike glycoprotein.","Callison, Scott Andrew; Jackwood, Mark W.; Hilt, Deborah Ann",Virus Genes,432,0

Moreover, it enables the home office, which is greatly expanded due to the current pandemic. Regarding workplace health, it should be noted that with increasing digitization, physical activity decreases, and as a result, the number of work-related diseases will increase. On the other hand, increasing digitization also offers promising opportunities for new approaches to workplace health promotion. With these positive as well as negative effects in mind, we designed a workshop to increase physical activity at work. This protocol describes our approach to a live workshop concept. METHODS: We use a randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups: a live workshop with and without additional reminders. The workshop intervention design consists of a baseline measurement, two workshops, and one follow-up measurement. Each workshop takes place in small groups (n < 11). We use a randomized allocation to both groups. To control for health-related effects and the expected behavior change we examine (i) physical activity (i.e. active time, taken steps, etc.) by a tracking device (ii) physical wellbeing, motivation, and volition by an online questionnaire, and (iii) participants also report physical activity by a diary. All measurements are taken one week before the respective workshop and 24 weeks after the initial baseline measures. DISCUSSION: A live workshop offers advantages such as very personal interactions and a low technical effort. However, during the current pandemic, there are some limitations (i.e. small groups, pay attention to hygienic guidelines). Based on the upcoming experiences of this workshop, a web-based approach might offer some advantages (i.e. easier daily implementation, independent from a participant’s location) regarding home office workplaces and the increasing digitization. On the other hand, there are also mandatory requirements as a stable internet connection and technical equipment (i.e. webcam, microphone). Overall, a step by step development of a web-based workshop, based on the experience of the live workshop, can be regarded as advantageous.

The present article summarizes the outcomes of clinical trials with antiviral drugs in COVID-19 patients. Many antiviral drugs failed to demonstrate beneficial effects or showed mixed results. One reason for the low success rate of clinical trials was shortcomings of antiviral tests in cell culture systems and another reason was the abundance of ill-coordinated and underpowered clinical trials. However, large pragmatic clinical trials particularly of the British RECOVERY trial series demonstrated that even under emergency situation drug trials can be conducted in a timely way such that the therapy of COVID-19 patients can be based on evidence basis instead on expert opinion or even worse on political pressure.","Brüssow, Harald",Environ. microbiol,432,16

DESIGN: : Prospective cohort study. SETTING: : Research hospital repurposed in to a COVID-19 center. PARTICIPANTS: : Consecutive patients admitted in COVID-19 ICU between March and June 2020. INTERVENTIONS: : A SF-36 questionnaire, which includes physical and mental items, was used 6 months after patients discharge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: : 403 patients were managed in the ICU with a hospital mortality of 181/403 (44.9%) while 16 (4.0%) further patients died within 6 months. Among the 125 questionnaire responders, only 32.0% and 52% had a normal quality of life in terms of the physical and mental component of health. Multivariable analysis identified low-molecular-weight heparin treatment in ICU as the only modifiable factor associated with an increase in physical component of QoL OR: 3.341 (95%CI 1.298-8.599), p=0.012, while age ≥52 years OR 0.223 and female sex OR 0.321 were significantly associated with a decrease in the physical component. Medical history of cerebrovascular insufficiency was significantly associated with a decrease in mental component of QoL OR: 0.125, while the only factor associated with an increase in the mental health component was BMI ≥ 27.6 kg / m2 OR 7.466. CONCLUSIONS: : In COVID-19 intensive care unit survivors we identified treatment with low molecular weight heparin as a predictor of improved physical component of QoL at 6-months.","Likhvantsev, V.; Landoni, G.; Perekhodov, S.; Chaus, N.; Kadantseva, K.; Ermokhina, L.; Baeva, A.; Yadgarov, M.; Berikashvili, L.; Kuzovlev, A.; Grechko, A.",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,432,1

Building on earlier work, we embedded social science research within an ongoing malaria human infection study in coastal Kenya to understand the study benefits and burdens experienced by study stakeholders in this low-resource setting and assess the wider implications for future research planning and policy. METHODS: Data were collected using qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews (44), focus group discussions (10) and non-participation observation. Study participants were purposively selected (key informant or maximal diversity sampling), including volunteers in the human infection study, study staff, community representatives and local administrative authorities. Data were collected during and up to 18 months following study residency, from sites in Coastal and Western Kenya. Voice recordings of interviews and discussions were transcribed, translated, and analysed using framework analysis, combining data- and theory-driven perspectives. FINDINGS: Physical, psychological, economic and social forms of benefits and burdens were experienced across study stages. Important benefits for volunteers included the study compensation, access to health checks, good residential living conditions, new learning opportunities, developing friendships and satisfaction at contributing towards a new malaria vaccine. Burdens primarily affected study volunteers, including experiences of discomfort and ill health; fear and anxiety around aspects of the trial process, particularly deliberate infection and the implications of prolonged residency; anxieties about early residency exit; and interpersonal conflict. These issues had important implications for volunteers’ families, study staff and the research institution’s reputation more widely. CONCLUSION: Developing ethically and scientifically strong HIS relies on grounded accounts of volunteers, study staff and the wider community, understood in the socioeconomic, political and cultural context where studies are implemented. Recognition of the diverse, and sometimes perverse, nature of potential benefits and burdens in a given context, and who this might implicate, is critical to this process. Prior and ongoing stakeholder engagement is core to developing these insights.

What CU patients expect from ICTs and which ICTs they prefer remains unknown. We assessed why CU patients use ICTs, which ones they prefer, and what drives their expectations and choices. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 1841 patients across 17 countries were recruited at UCAREs (Urticaria Centers of Reference and Excellence). Patients with CU who were >12 years old completed a 23-item questionnaire. RESULTS: Most patients were interested in receiving disease information (87.3%), asking physicians about CU (84.1%), and communicating with other patients through ICTs (65.6%). For receiving disease information, patients preferred one-to-one and one-to-many ICTs, especially web browsers. One-to-one ICTs were also the ICTs of choice for asking physicians about urticaria and for communicating with other patients, and e-mail and WhatsApp were the preferred ICTs, respectively. Many-to-many ICTs such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter were least preferred for all 3 purposes. Living in rural areas and higher education were linked to higher odds of being interested in receiving disease information, asking physicians, and communicating with patients through ICTs. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients and especially patients with higher education who live in rural areas are interested in using ICTs for their healthcare, but prefer different ICTs for different purposes, ie, web browsers for obtaining information, e-mail for asking physicians, and WhatsApp for communicating with other patients. Our findings may help to improve ICTs for CU.","Cherrez-Ojeda, Ivan; Vanegas, Emanuel; Cherrez, Annia; Felix, Miguel; Weller, Karsten; Magerl, Markus; Maurer, Rasmus Robin; Mata, Valeria L.; Kasperska-Zajac, Alicja; Sikora, Agnieszka; Fomina, Daria; Kovalkova, Elena; Godse, Kiran; Rao, Nimmagadda Dheeraj; Khoshkhui, Maryam; Rastgoo, Sahar; Criado, Roberta FJ.; Abuzakouk, Mohamed; Grandon, Deepa; Van Doorn, Martijn B.A.; Oliveira Rodrigues Valle, Solange; De Souza Lima, Eduardo Magalhães; Thomsen, Simon Francis; Ramón, German D.; Matos Benavides, Edgar E.; Bauer, Andrea; Giménez-Arnau, Ana M.; Kocatürk, Emek; Guillet, Carole; Larco, Jose Ignacio; Zhao, Zuo-Tao; Makris, Michael; Ritchie, Carla; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Ensina, Luis Felipe; Cherrez, Sofia; Maurer, Marcus",World Allergy Organ J,432,1

Little is known about their experiences. This study explores women’s experiences with (online) abortion services and relevant health professionals’ experiences delivering care, with the goal of identifying key barriers encountered by abortion-seekers in the Netherlands. An exploratory qualitative research design with a constructivist approach and an abbreviated grounded theory method was used. Interviews with 20 women who had had an abortion and 14 health professionals who provide abortion care, and 200 emails of women seeking abortion care through the non-governmental organisation Women on Web, were coded inductively and deductively (using the Candidacy Framework) thereby generating themes. Abortion-seekers faced barriers including: (i) burden of taboo, (ii) vulnerability (emotional, financial, and social), (iii) health professional evaluation and (iv) disempowerment and distress. The overarching theme was women’s lack of autonomy in access to abortion care. The key barriers to abortion access in the Netherlands are the institutionalisation of taboo in abortion law and care, complex candidacy regulations, lack of permeability for certain marginalised groups, and women’s inability to speak openly about abortion. To increase the permeability of abortion care, and thereby women’s autonomy, legislators and policy-makers must trust women to make their own reproductive decisions and avoid actions that stigmatise abortion and hinder access to care, while actively developing systemic support for vulnerable groups.","Holten, Lianne; de Goeij, Eva; Kleiverda, Gunilla",Sexual and reproductive health matters,432,3

However, adherence to social distance measures presumably requires knowledge and understanding of the current social distancing restrictions. METHODS: A modified version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour examined the role of knowledge and understanding of current social distancing measures in predicting intentions to adhere to social distancing restrictions. An online survey was administered to respondents (N = 374) in Melbourne, Australia during a period of heightened social distancing restrictions. In addition to measuring respondents’ general intentions to adhere to restrictions, vignettes were used to assess intended behaviour in specific situations. RESULTS: Knowledge of social distancing restrictions predicted intentions to adhere in specific situations, but not general intentions to adhere. Knowledge of restrictions also predicted positive attitudes towards current restrictions and a greater perceived ability to adhere to the restrictions, while positive attitudes was a good predictor of both general and specific intentions to adhere. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that attitudes towards restrictions may influence whether individuals attempt to adhere to restrictions, but knowledge of the restrictions influences whether the intended behaviour actually adheres to current restrictions. SO WHAT? These outcomes indicate that members of the public should be educated regarding the negative consequences associated with the COVID‐19 virus and the capacity of social distancing to reduce transmission of the virus, and a need for social distancing restrictions to be uncomplicated and clearly communicated.","Sturman, Daniel; Auton, Jaime C.; Thacker, Jemma",Health Promot J Austr,432,24

SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase (SARS 3CL(pro)) plays key roles in viral replication and transcription and is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug discovery. In this report, we quantitatively characterized the dimerization features of the full-length and N-terminal residues 1–7 deleted SARS 3CL(pro)s by using glutaraldehyde cross-linking SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography, and isothermal titration calorimeter techniques. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography results show that, similar to the full-length SARS 3CL(pro), the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CL(pro) still remains a dimer/monomer mixture within a wide range of protein concentrations. Isothermal titration calorimeter determinations indicate that the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of the N-terminal deleted proteinase dimer (262 μm) is very similar to that of the full-length proteinase dimer (227 μm). Enzymatic activity assay using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer method reveals that N-terminal deletion results in almost complete loss of enzymatic activity for SARS 3CL(pro). Molecular dynamics and docking simulations demonstrate the N-terminal deleted proteinase dimer adopts a state different from that of the full-length proteinase dimer, which increases the angle between the two protomers and reduces the binding pocket that is not beneficial to the substrate binding. This conclusion is verified by the surface plasmon resonance biosensor determination, indicating that the model substrate cannot bind to the N-terminal deleted proteinase. These results suggest the N terminus is not indispensable for the proteinase dimerization but may fix the dimer at the active state and is therefore vital to enzymatic activity.","Chen, Shuai; Chen, Lili; Tan, Jinzhi; Chen, Jing; Du, Li; Sun, Tao; Shen, Jianhua; Chen, Kaixian; Jiang, Hualiang; Shen, Xu",J Biol Chem,432,24

Direct contact transmission, mediated by aerosols or droplets, is widely demonstrated, whereas indirect transmission is only supported by collateral evidence such as virus persistence on inanimate surfaces and data from other similar viruses. The present systematic review aims to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence on inanimate surfaces, identifying risk levels according to surface characteristics. Data were obtained from studies in published papers collected from two databases (PubMed and Embase) with the last search on 1 September 2020. Included studies had to be papers in English, had to deal with coronavirus and had to consider inanimate surfaces in real settings. Studies were coded according to our assessment of the risk that the investigated surfaces could be contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis and a metaregression were carried out to quantify virus RNA prevalence and to identify important factors driving differences among studies. Thirty-nine out of forty retrieved paper reported studies carried out in healthcare settings on the prevalence of virus RNA, five studies carry out also analyses through cell culture and six tested the viability of isolated viruses. Overall prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on high-, medium- and low-risk surfaces were 0.22 (CI(95) [0.152–0.296]), 0.04 (CI(95) [0.007–0.090]), and 0.00 (CI(95) [0.00–0.019]), respectively.

This study evaluated the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methodology: This study represents a prospective cohort in a public and tertiary university hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, during the first 90 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, with patients followed up until the clinical outcome (discharge or death). Results: There were 101 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, of which 51.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall AKI incidence was 50%; 36.8% had hematuria or proteinuria (66.6% of those with AKI), 10.2% had rhabdomyolysis, and mortality was 36.6%. Of the ICU patients, AKI occurred in 77.3% and the mortality was 65.4%.

Recent studies revealed that ApoE, a protein encoded by APOE gene, may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 cases. ApoE has been involved with prevention of tissue damage and promotion of adaptative immune response in the lungs. This study investigated frequencies distribution of alleles that alter the ApoE expression in lung tissues to trace a profile of these variants and associate them to COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Data about APOE expression levels was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and the allele frequencies of APOE variants was acquired from the populations included in the phase 3 release of the 1000 Genomes Project. A total of 128 variants showed a significant impact on the APOE expression in lung tissues (p < 0.0001). Linkage Disequilibrium analysis revealed that 98 variants were closely grouped into seven distinct haplotype blocks, of which six were composed of variants that significantly decrease APOE gene expression in the lungs. Most of the haplotypes with higher impact on APOE expression showed greater frequencies in Europeans and lower in Africans, which implies that European populations might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Patients admitted to the PICU (2004–2014) with acute respiratory disease were included. Analyses were performed utilising each respiratory viral infection or multiple viral infections as an exposure. RESULTS: There were 1766 admissions with acute respiratory disease of which 1372 had respiratory virus testing and 748 had one or more viruses detected. The risk of intubation before or during the PICU stay was higher if parainfluenza virus was detected compared to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (OR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.06–4.56). Sixty‐three admissions had two or more viruses detected, and the combination of RSV and Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most common.

Air is used as a heat transfer medium in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The air contains a variety of pollutants, viruses, and bacteria, all of which have an impact on and destroy human life. Significantly in summer, people spend more time in air conditioners which results in lower levels of vitamin D and melatonin which may affect the functioning of their immune system and are susceptible to receiving SARS-CoV-2 from other individuals. As an important component of air conditioning and ventilation systems, the air filter plays a significant role. As a result, researchers must work harder to improve its design to prevent the ultra-small particles loaded with COVID-19. This paper contributes to the design of existing HVAC systems in terms of their suitability and impact on the spread of the hybrid SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, as well as efforts to obtain a highly efficient air filter to remove super-sized particles for protection against epidemic infection. In addition, important guideline recommendations have been extracted to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 throughout the world and to get the highest quality indoor air in air-conditioned places.","Elsaid, Ashraf Mimi; Mohamed, Hany A.; Abdelaziz, Gamal B.; Ahmed, M.

As of January 6th, 2021, there were over 86 million global confirmed cases, and the disease has claimed over 1.87 million lives (a ∼2.2% case fatality rate). SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect human cells by binding its spike (S) protein to angiotensin-conversing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed abundantly in several cell types and tissues. ACE2 has extensive biological activities as a component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and plays a pivotal role as counter-regulator of angiotensin II (Ang II) activity by converting the latter to Ang (1-7). Virion binding to ACE2 for host cell entry leads to internalization of both via endocytosis, as well as activation of ADAM17/TACE, resulting in downregulation of ACE2 and loss of its protective actions in the lungs and other organs. Although COVID-19 was initially described as a purely respiratory disease, it is now known that infected individuals can rapidly progress to a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In fact, all human structures that express ACE2 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or to the downstream effects of reduced ACE2 levels, namely systemic inflammation and injury. In this review, we aim to summarize the major features of SARS-CoV-2 biology and the current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, as well as its clinical repercussions in the lung, heart, kidney, bowel, liver, and brain. We also highlight potential therapeutic targets and current global efforts to identify safe and effective therapies against this life-threatening condition.","Lopes-Pacheco, Miquéias; Silva, Pedro Leme; Cruz, Fernanda Ferreira; Battaglini, Denise; Robba, Chiara; Pelosi, Paolo; Morales, Marcelo Marcos; Caruso Neves, Celso; Rocco, Patricia Rieken Macedo",Front Physiol,432,21

The COVID-19 epidemic evolved at the beginning of 2020 into a pandemic, which continues to this day. The incredible speed of the spread and the consequences of the infection had a worldwide impact on societies and health systems. Governments enforced many measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic: Restrictions (e.g. lockdown), medical care (e.g. intensive care) and medical prevention (e.g. hygiene concept). This leads to a different spreading behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on measures. Furthermore, the spreading behavior is influenced by culture and geographical impacts. The spreading behavior of COVID-19 related to short time intervals can be described by Weibull distribution models, common in reliability engineering, in a sound way. The interpretation of the model parameters allows the assessment of the COVID-19 spreading characteristics. This paper shows results of a research study of the COVID-19 spreading behavior depending on different pandemic time phases within Germany and Japan. Both countries are industrial nations, but have many differences with respect to historical development, culture and geographical conditions. Consequently, the chosen government measures have different impacts on the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research study contains the analyses of different pandemic time intervals in Germany and Japan: The breakout phase in spring 2020 and subsequently following waves until winter season 2020/2021.","Bracke, S.; Puls, A.; Inoue, M.",,432,32
