An emerging strategy for overcoming bone marrow toxicity involves ex vivo genetic transfer of drug resistance to autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells, followed by reimplantation of the transfected cells before chemotherapy. Here we establish that expression of mutant TS genes, selected from millions of engineered variants, renders human hematopoietic cells resistant to 5-FUdR, and identify the most efficacious variant for gene therapeutic rescue of drug-induced myelosuppression.","Bielas, Jason H; Schmitt, Michael W; Icreverzi, Amalia; Ericson, Nolan G; Loeb, Lawrence A",Human gene therapy,854,5

METHODS twenty-eight Wistar rats were implanted with synthetic meshes that were either non-absorbable (polypropylene (PP), n = 14) or absorbable (poly (D: ,L: -lactic acid) (PLA94), n = 14). A validated animal incisionnal abdominal hernia model of mesh infection was used. Fourteen meshes (n = 7 PLA94 and n = 7 PP meshes) were infected intraoperatively with 10e6 CFU Escherichia coli, and compared with 14 non-infected meshes (n = 7 PLA94 and n = 7 PP meshes) (control groups). Explantations were performed on day 30. Shrinkage was evaluated by a reproducible numerical analysis of mesh area. Infection and histological study were evaluated on day 30. RESULTS non-infected meshes were less shrunk than infected meshes for both non-absorbable (5.0 ± 1.7% versus 21.6 ± 6.1%, p < 0.05) and absorbable meshes (2.4 ± 0.9% versus 11.0 ± 2.5%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION this study highlights a link between infection and shrinkage in the model used.","Mamy, Laurent; Letouzey, Vincent; Lavigne, Jean-Philippe; Garric, Xavier; Gondry, Jean; Mares, Pierre; de Tayrac, Renaud",International urogynecology journal,854,27

Inflammation affects atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and promotes a thrombogenic environment. We report a series of 6 patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to intraluminal carotid artery thrombus presenting during an 8-day period. Six patients were included (5 men) with a mean age of 65.8 years (range, 55-78 years). COVID-19 was diagnosed by detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 in 5 patients and was presumed due to typical clinical and imaging findings in 1 patient. All patients had vascular risk factors including diabetes (83%), hyperlipidemia (100%), and smoking (17%). Four patients presented with large infarcts with initial NIHSS scores of 24-30. During their hospitalization, all patients had elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, 5 patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, 3 had elevated interleukin-6 levels, and 2 had elevated troponin levels. Inflammation related to COVID-19 may result in rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke.","Mohamud, A Y; Griffith, B; Rehman, M; Miller, D; Chebl, A; Patel, S C; Howell, B; Kole, M; Marin, H",AJNR.

DESIGN Rasch analysis of ICARE Phase III trial data, comparing three upper extremity (UE) motor treatments in stroke survivors enrolled 45.8±22.4 days post-stroke. Participants underwent a structured UE motor training called Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program, usual and customary care, or dose-equivalent care. UEFM data from Baseline, post-intervention, 6, and 12 months were included for analysis. SETTING Outpatient stroke rehabilitation. PARTICIPANTS ICARE participants. INTERVENTIONS N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Item difficulties, person abilities, sample size. RESULTS Summed raw UEFM scores, because of their ordinality, measured motor impairment inconsistently across different ranges of stroke severity relative to the rescaled UEFM. In the full ICARE sample (N=361), raw UEFM understated scores relative to rescaled by 7.4 points for the most severely impaired, but overstated scores by up to 8.4 points towards the ceiling. As a result, 50.9% of all UEFM observations showed a residual error greater than 10% of the total UEFM score. Relative to the raw, the rescaled UEFM improved effect size of change in motor impairment between baseline and 1-year (d=0.35). For a hypothetical three-arm trial resembling ICARE, UEFM rescaling reduced required sample size by 32% (n = 108) compared to raw UEFM (n= 159). CONCLUSIONS In UE rehabilitation trials, a rescaled UEFM potentially decreases sample size by 1/3, decreasing costs, duration, and subjects exposed to experimental risks. This benefit is obtained through increased measurement efficiency; reductions in ceiling effects are also possible. These findings apply to ICARE-like trials; confirmatory validation in another Phase III trial is needed.","Geed, Shashwati; Lane, Christianne J; Nelsen, Monica A; Wolf, Steven L; Winstein, Carolee J; Dromerick, Alexander W",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,854,13

Számos közlemény született arról, hogy a COVID-19-pneumoniás betegek jelentős hányadában az artériás parciális oxigéntenzió kifejezetten alacsony, mégsem jellemző a dyspnoe, és a pulzusoximetria sem mutat - a csökkent oxigéntenzióval arányos - súlyos hypoxaemiát. A jelenséget ""happy hypoxaemia"" néven említik. Ugyanakkor a légszomjról nem panaszkodó, de súlyos alveolocapillaris O2-felvételi zavarban szenvedő COVID-19-pneumoniás betegek a legkisebb fizikai megterhelést sem tűrik, és állapotuk gyorsan kritikussá válhat, tehát a hypoxaemia mértékének időben való felismerése kulcskérdés. A jelen közleményben egy ilyen eset rövid ismertetése után összefoglaljuk a súlyos, de tünetmentes hypoxaemia hátterében meghúzódó élettani okokat. Ezek között szerepel a hypocapnia (respiratoricus alkalosis) is, mely alacsony oxigéntenzió mellett is a hemoglobin viszonylag megtartott oxigénszaturációját eredményezi. Ezért a mindennapi COVID-19-ellátásban a megismételt artériásvérgáz-meghatározások jelentősége nem hangsúlyozható eléggé. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 362-365. Summary. Many COVID-19 patients have very low arterial partial oxigen tension while severe dyspnoe does not develop. Pulse oxymetry indicates only moderate reduction of arterial O2 saturation in these patients. The phenomenon is named ""happy hypoxaemia"". Lack of (severe) dyspnoe and only moderately decreased O2 saturation in severely impaired alveolo-capillary O2 uptake may partially be explained by an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin in the presence of low arterial partial pressure of CO2. The latter results from increased alveolar ventilation, while low partial pressure of O2 in COVID-19 patients reflects right-to-left shunting of pulmonary blood flow and ventilation-perfusion mismatch of the diseased lungs. While such patients may have mild complaints as related to the real impairment of alveolo-capillary oxygen exchange, severe hypoxaemia is a negative prognostic factor of outcome in this state where severe clinical deterioration may rapidly appear. The latter circumstance together with the unusual relationship of O2 partial pressure and O2 saturation of hemoglobin in COVID-19 emphasize the importance of repeated complete arterial blood gas analyses in these patients.

In Experiment 1, Herschel, and control participants, were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing videos of moving faces, or static images taken from the videos. In Experiment 2, participants viewed videos of actors making facial expressions, or static images taken from the videos. In Experiment 3, participants viewed videos of moving faces presented in the left or right visual field. Results showed the neural response in Herschel's right occipital face area (OFA) was impaired for moving and static faces (Experiment 1), moving expressions (Experiment 2) and moving faces in the left visual field (Experiment 3). The response in Herschel's right fusiform face area (FFA) to moving and static faces was impaired in Experiment 1 only, in Experiments 2 and 3 Herschel's FFA response was not significantly different from controls. By contrast, the response in Herschel's right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) to moving and static faces and expressions (Experiments 1 and 2) and the visual field response (Experiment 3) was not significantly different from control participants.

METHODS Four hundred and eleven consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: 214 cases in 2014-2016 with disinfection using povidone-iodine antiseptic solution alone (Group A) and 197 cases in 2017-2019 with additional intrauterine douche using HClO (Group B). HClO was used at a concentration of 200 ppm of residual chlorine. One gram of Ceftriaxone Sodium Hydrate was administered by drip infusion during MEA in both groups. Oral antibiotics were administered after MEA only in group A but not in Group B. RESULTS Mean patient age (mean ± SD; years old) was 44.5 ± 4.6 in group A and 44.8 ± 5.4 in group B, and mean operation time (min) was 30.4 ± 19.1 in group A and 34.4 ± 22.6 in group B, respectively. Neither were significantly different between groups. The combined ablation techniques i.e. transcervical microwave myolysis and transcervical microwave adenomyolysis did not increase frequency of infection. Postoperative intrauterine infection cases in group B (8 cases) were significantly lower than those in group A (28 cases) (Chi-square test, P = 0.001). Hysterectomy was performed in three severe intrauterine infection cases in group A, but no cases of severe intrauterine infection was found in group B. No adverse effect of HClO was seen. CONCLUSION Intrauterine douche using HClO decreases postoperative intrauterine infection after MEA.","Tsuda, Akira; Kanaoka, Yasushi",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,854,1

The surgical approaches included local repair by suture, stoma relocation and mesh-based techniques; but none has been able to provide satisfactory results. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 60-year-old asian female was referred complaining of abdominal pain and constipation caused by recurrent parastomal hernia of an end stoma. She had undergone total cystectomy with creation of an ileal conduit at the age of 53 years, and laparoscopic sigmoid colostomy at the age of 55 years. Parastomal hernia of an end stoma had developed postoperatively, and she had undergone recreation of colostomy at the same place with fasciorrhaphy at the age of 59 years, but parastomal hernia recurred 6 months later because of split fascia sutures. Laparoscopic repair for recurrent parastomal hernia was conducted using the sandwich technique while preserving an ileal conduit. The patient has been followed postoperatively for more than 3 years without any sign of recurrence. DISCUSSION Although further cases are required to get definitive conclusions, we suppose that the laparoscopic sandwich technique can be useful for parastomal hernia. CONCLUSION We herein report a case of recurrent parastomal hernia treated laparoscopically while preserving an ileal conduit using the sandwich technique which combines the keyhole and Sugarbaker techniques. This is a quite rare case report of laparoscopic repair for recurrent parastomal hernia in a patient with an ileal conduit.","Wada, Toshiaki; Kawada, Kenji; Hasegawa, Suguru; Sakai, Yoshiharu",International journal of surgery case reports,854,12

Minimal invasive surgery has multiple advantages in neurologically impaired patients. Robotic approach has overcome disadvantages linked to laparoscopy, in particular, referring to the surgeon fatigue. METHODS A retrospective study comparing five laparoscopic and five robotic TOGD was conducted between February and October 2016 in Giannina Gaslini Children's Hospital and Section of Pediatric Surgery of Siena. Neurologically impaired children scheduled for TOGD were included. Age, sex, weight, symptomatology, presence of epilepsy, and preoperative X-ray contrast were considered. Operative time, hospital stay, postoperative complications, redo surgery, nutrition rehabilitation, and X-ray contrast study after 5 days and after 1 month from the intervention were recorded. RESULTS In our series, there were no intraoperative complications, no conversions to open surgery, and no vagal lesions. In two of five robotic cases, a pyloroplasty was necessary. The median operative time was statistically longer in the robotic group. One dehiscence in the robotic group was recorded, and no dumping episodes occurred. No statistical differences in terms of complications were detected. CONCLUSION TOGD is feasible both with laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery with similar results. Robotic approach is considered feasible. At the same time, high laparoscopic skills allow to reach the same results as robotic approach with shorter operative time.","Mattioli, Girolamo; Wong, Michela C Y; Angotti, Rossella; Mazzola, Cinzia; Arrigo, Serena; Gandullia, Paolo; Mancardi, Margherita; Fusi, Giulia; Messina, Mario; Zanaboni, Clelia; Razore, Barbara; Barabino, Arrigo; Molinaro, Francesco",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,854,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS Instrument content was based on qualitative information obtained from a panel of bladder cancer providers and from patient focus groups. Draft items were piloted and revised, resulting in the 36-item Bladder Cancer Index consisting of urinary, bowel and sexual health domains. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, concurrent validity and criterion validity were then assessed. RESULTS Internal consistency was high at 0.77 to 0.91. Test-retest reliability was also high at 0.73 to 0.95. Correlations among the 3 domains were low (r < or = 0.39), indicating interscale independence. Health outcome discrimination was apparent in clinically distinct treatment groups. Moderate correlation was observed with existing external measures, indicating that the Bladder Cancer Index detects aspects of health related quality of life related to bladder cancer treatments that are not recorded by more general measures. CONCLUSIONS The Bladder Cancer Index is a robust, multidimensional measure of bladder cancer specific health related quality of life and to our knowledge is the first available validated instrument to assess health outcomes across a range of local treatments commonly used for bladder cancer.","Gilbert, Scott M; Dunn, Rodney L; Hollenbeck, Brent K; Montie, James E; Lee, Cheryl T; Wood, David P; Wei, John T",The Journal of urology,854,28

All patients were advised bed rest for an hour after ET. The clinic's electronic database was screened to identify the uterine anatomy of the patients, transferred embryo quality, and urinary catheterization status. Only women with an anteverted and anteflexed uterus and cycles that resulted in high-quality blastocyst transfers were included in this analysis. Finally, 71 cycles with urinary catheterization and 81 cycles with no catheterization were analyzed. RESULTS The clinical (53.5 vs. 40.7%, p = 0.115) and ongoing pregnancy (43.7 vs. 35.8%, p = 0.323) rates were comparable between urinary catheterization and non-catheterization groups.

CONCLUSION Our 360° reconstruction during RASP is feasible and safe. The aim of the technique is to minimize use of electrocautery and decrease the raw surface area on the prostate capsule. This technical modification could potentially lessen postoperative bleeding after RASP and therefore the need for continuous bladder irrigation. In addition, it could potentially lead to mitigation of burning and irritative postoperative symptoms. Longer follow-up and comparative studies of different RASP techniques are still needed.","Cacciamani, Giovanni; Medina, Luis; Ashrafi, Akbar; Landsberger, Hannah; Winter, Matthew; Mekhail, Peter; Desai, Mihir; Aron, Monish; Berger, Andre",BJU international,854,28

However, this may be related to the lower variability and hence narrower normative limits of structural tests. In this study, we ask whether a time lag exists between the true rates of change in structure and function, regardless of clinical detectability of those changes. Methods Structural equation models were used to determine whether the rate of change in function (mean linearized total deviation, AveTDLin) or structure (retinal nerve fiber layer thickness [RNFLT]) was predicted by the concurrent or previous rate for the other modality, after adjusting for its own rate in the previous time interval. Rates were calculated over 1135 pairs of consecutive visits from 318 eyes of 164 participants in the Portland Progression Project, with mean 207 days between visits. Results The rate of change of AveTDLin was predicted by its own rate in the previous time interval, but not by rates of RNFLT change in either the concurrent or previous time interval (both P > 0.05). Similarly, the rate of RNFLT change was not predicted by concurrent AveTDLin change after adjusting for its own previous rate. However, the rate of AveTDLin change in the previous time interval did significantly improve prediction of the current rate for RNFLT, with P = 0.005, suggesting a time lag of around six months between changes in AveTDLin and RNFLT. Conclusions Although RNFL thinning may be detectable sooner, true functional change appears to predict and precede thinning of the RNFL in glaucoma.","Gardiner, Stuart K; Mansberger, Steven L; Fortune, Brad",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,854,1

This study focuses on a research capacity strengthening project supporting seven test facilities in Africa conducting studies on mosquito vector control products towards Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) certification. It captures the primary effects of the project on each facility's research capacity, the secondary effects at the individual and institutional level, and the ripple effects that extend beyond the research system. The relationships between effects at different levels are identified and compared to an existing framework for the evaluation of research capacity strengthening initiatives. Methods: To capture the views of individuals engaged in the project at all levels within each facility, a maximum-variation purposive sampling strategy was used. This allowed triangulation between different data sources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals in three facilities and a combination of email and remote video-call interviews were conducted with individuals at two further facilities. Results: We found that, despite a focus of the GLP certification project at the institutional level, the project had effects also at individual (including enhanced motivation, furtherment of careers) and national/international levels (including development of regional expertise). In addition, we detected ripple effects of the project which extended beyond the research system. Conclusion: This study shows that research capacity strengthening interventions that are focussed on institutional level goals require actions also at individual and national/international levels. The effects of engagement at all three levels can be amplified by collaborative actions at the national/international level. These findings show that research capacity strengthening projects must develop plans that address and evaluate impact at all three levels. Capturing the ripple effects of investment in research capacity strengthening should also be planned for from the beginning of projects to support further engagement of all stakeholders.","Begg, Sara; Wright, Alexandra; Small, Graham; Abdoulaye, Diabate; Kisinza, William; Koudou, Benjamin; Moore, Sarah; Mosha, Franklin; Edi, Constant; Kirby, Matthew; Kija, Patrick; Malima, Robert; Moore, Jason; Bates, Imelda",Gates open research,854,19

Historically, the gold standard for grading diabetic retinopathy has been based on 7-field 30-degree color fundus photographs that capture roughly the central third of the retina. Our aim was to review recent literature on the role of ultra-widefield (allowing capture of up to 82% of the retina in one frame) fundus imaging in screening, prognostication, and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. RECENT FINDINGS Ultra-widefield fundus imaging can capture peripheral retinal lesions outside the traditional 7-field photographs that may correlate with increased risk of diabetic retinopathy progression. The speed and ability to image through undilated pupils make ultra-widefield imaging attractive for tele-ophthalmology screening. Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography may help guide targeted laser treatment in eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Ultra-widefield imaging has potential to help shape new diabetic retinopathy screening, staging, and treatment protocols.","Cai, Sophie; Liu, T Y Alvin",Current diabetes reports,854,1

This adversity is amplified in applicants from medical schools without a home plastic surgery residency program and academic division. There is a paucity of data on the advantage of medical students applying from an institution with a home residency program. Applicant data from the past 5 years were accessed from the Association of American Medical Colleges Electronic Residency Application Services statistics form. Individual home programs of successfully matched applicants were collected from plastic surgery residency websites. A survey was distributed to 32 students pursuing specialty residencies from home medical schools without a plastic surgery residency. Evaluation of a subset of incoming plastic surgery interns revealed that 72% of matched applicants attended home medical institutions with plastic surgery residency programs. Seventy-seven percent of survey respondents felt strongly that students at institutions with home residency programs had a significant advantage. The current COVID pandemic is changing the landscape of subinternships and bringing to light the disadvantage students face without home residency programs. The development of virtual subinternships, online mentorship, and selection of students for subinternships from geographic areas without home programs may help address some disparities in educational opportunities. Continuing these virtual programs and offering preferential help to disadvantaged medical students permanently is an avenue for the field of plastic surgery to be a leader in diversity and inclusion.","Baghchechi, Mohsen; Oviedo, Parisa; McLean, Paige; Dean, Riley; Dobke, Marek",Annals of plastic surgery,854,22

Many methods of taping have been described, although little has been published comparing various methods of taping to one another. In this study, we evaluated several methods for securing ETTs with tape. We hypothesized a difference in mean peak forces between the methods studied during forced extubation. METHODS Five methods of securing an ETT with tape were studied in a variety of contexts including cadaver and simulation lab settings. Testing included measurement of peak force (Newton [N]) during forced extubation, durability of taping following mechanical stress, effects of tape length-width variation, and characterization of failure mechanisms. RESULTS We found several significant differences in mean peak extubation forces between the 5 methods of taping, with mean peak forces during forced extubation ranging from 20 N to 156 N. In separate tests, we found an association between mean peak forces and total surface area as well as geometric configuration of tape on the face. Long thin strips of tape appeared to provide surprising durability against forced extubation, a phenomenon that was associated with minimization of the ""peel angle"" as tape was removed. CONCLUSIONS We found evidence of differential structural integrity between the 5 taping methods studied. More generally, we found that increased peak extubation forces were associated with increased total surface area of tape and that minimization of the ""peel angle"" by lateral application of tape is associated with surprisingly high relative peak extubation forces.","Matchett, Gerald; Yang, Judy H; Sripathi, Nishith R; Simpkins, Landon; Ruikar, Kinnari; Minhajuddin, Abu; Whitten, Charles W",Anesthesia and analgesia,854,1

Recent data indicate that the biology of sialic acids (which directly involves less than 60 genes) shows more than 10 uniquely human genetic changes in comparison with our closest evolutionary relatives. Known outcomes are tissue-specific changes in abundant cell-surface glycans, changes in specificity and/or expression of multiple proteins that recognize these glycans, and novel pathogen regimes. Specific events include Alu-mediated inactivation of the CMAH gene, resulting in loss of synthesis of the Sia N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and increase in expression of the precursor N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac); increased expression of alpha2-6-linked Sias (likely because of changed expression of ST6GALI); and multiple changes in SIGLEC genes encoding Sia-recognizing Ig-like lectins (Siglecs). The last includes binding specificity changes (in Siglecs -5, -7, -9, -11, and -12); expression pattern changes (in Siglecs -1, -5, -6, and -11); gene conversion (SIGLEC11); and deletion or pseudogenization (SIGLEC13, SIGLEC14, and SIGLEC16). A nongenetic outcome of the CMAH mutation is human metabolic incorporation of foreign dietary Neu5Gc, in the face of circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, generating a novel ""xeno-auto-antigen"" situation. Taken together, these data suggest that both the genes associated with Sia biology and the related impacts of the environment comprise a relative ""hot spot"" of genetic and physiological changes in human evolution, with implications for uniquely human features both in health and disease.","Varki, Ajit",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,854,17

Using sequences encoding 78% of the rabies virus genome, we explored the extent, repeatability and dynamic outcome of evolution associated with multiple host shifts among New World bats. Episodic bursts of positive selection were detected in several viral proteins, including regions associated with host cell interaction and viral replication. Host shifts involved unique sets of substitutions, and few sites exhibited repeated evolution across adaptation to many bat species, suggesting diverse genetic determinants over host range. Combining these results with genetic reconstructions of the demographic histories of individual viral lineages revealed that although rabies viruses shared consistent three-stage processes of emergence in each new bat species, host shifts involving greater numbers of positively selected substitutions had longer delays between cross-species transmission and enzootic viral establishment. Our results point to multiple evolutionary routes to host establishment in a zoonotic RNA virus that may influence the speed of viral emergence.","Streicker, Daniel G; Altizer, Sonia M; Velasco-Villa, Andrés; Rupprecht, Charles E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,854,19

We conducted face-to-face interviews with 33 HCPs from 7 ambulatory healthcare services in the Al Ain region, UAE. An interview guide was developed based on the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control guide for vaccine hesitancy among HCPs. An inductive thematic framework was employed to explore the main and emerging themes conceptualizing the predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors that influence HCPs' hesitancy regarding vaccinations for themselves and while recommending, prescribing, or discussing vaccines with their patients. The sample included general practitioners, family physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other administrative staff. The major themes included positive predisposing factors such as trust in the system and the government, previous education, and social responsibility. Positive enabling factors included affordability and availability of vaccination services. Many participants were hesitant to receive the mandatory influenza vaccination. Misinformation regarding vaccines on social media was a major concern. However, HCPs showed little interest in being active on social media. Most participants reported never receiving any training on how to address vaccine hesitancy among patients. Because HCPs play an important role in influencing patients' decisions regarding undergoing vaccination, their confidence in addressing vaccine hesitancy must be improved.","Elbarazi, Iffat; Al-Hamad, Sania; Alfalasi, Salma; Aldhaheri, Ruwaya; Dubé, Eve; Alsuwaidi, Ahmed R",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,854,1

METHODS We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, using both cis and trans-acting protein expression quantitative trait loci (pQTL) near GP1BA and BRAP genes as instruments. To assess if platelet count mediated the effect, we then performed a two-step MR study. Putative associations (GPIbα/ platelet count/ disease) detected by MR analyses were subsequently assessed using multiple-trait-colocalization analyses. RESULTS After correcting for multiple testing (P ≤ 2×10-3 ), GPIbα, instrumented by either cis-pQTL or trans-pQTL, was causally implicated with increased risk of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA - oligoarticular and rheumatoid factor negative subtypes). These effects of GPIbα appear to be mediated by platelet count and are supported by strong evidence of colocalization (probability of all three traits sharing a common causal variant ≥ 0.80). GPIbα instrumented by cis-pQTL did not appear to affect cardiovascular risk, although the GPIbα trans-pQTL associates with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases but decreased risk of autoinflammatory diseases, suggesting this trans- instrument acts through other pathways.

There are growing concerns on the impact of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Several papers reporting recommendations and guidelines are published. But few data on cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are available. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients affected by gynecological cancer who developed COVID-19. All patients were treated in an academic setting (in Milan, Lombardy, Italy) between February and March 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 355 patients had active treatment during the study period due to newly diagnosed or recurrent gynecological disease. Among those, 19 (5.3%) patients affected developed COVID-19. All patients were asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 detection. Six patients were diagnosed before starting planned treatments; while the remaining 13 were diagnosed for COVID-19 after their started their treatments. Considering the first group of six patients, one patient died due to COVID-19 3 days after the diagnosis; while the other patients recovered from COVID-19 after a median of three weeks. The latter group of 13 patients (treatments started) included five patients who underwent surgery and eight patients who underwent chemotherapy. Focusing on five patients who were diagnosed after surgery, we observed that two patients died during postoperative course, while in other two cases prolonged hospitalization was needed. One patient had no issues. Chemotherapy was delayed for the remaining patents without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights that COVID-19 impacts the quality of treatments for cancer patients.

We conducted 52 individual and 2 group interviews with 18 key stakeholders involved with enforcing lockdown orders. Responses were analyzed in themes using content and discourse analysis.Result: The participants stated that the greatest challenge faced by many amidst the pandemic is hunger and starvation and described government palliatives as grossly insufficient. This is linked to the high population of Nigerians living below poverty line, who depends on daily earning for survival.Discussion: Therefore, these viewpoints must be taken into account by the policymakers and social welfare providers when designing social welfare policies and interventions for poor/vulnerable Nigerians.","Nwatu, Uche L; Nwafor, Nneka F; Odo, Casmir O; Onalu, Chinyere E",J Evid Based Soc Work (2019),854,1

This study aimed to investigate the effects of home confinement as a result of lockdown on the activity (physical activity and sedentary behaviors), and their determinants, on French children (6-10 years) and adolescents (11-17 years). Methods: The National Observatory for Physical Activity and Sedentary behaviors launched an online survey from April 1st, to May 6th, 2020 using popular social networks and websites. It compared the level of physical activity (PA), sitting and screen time before and during the lockdown and identified the impact of the initial PA (active vs. inactive), sedentary (high vs. low) profiles of the participants and the housing conditions. Results: 6,491 children were included in this study. Initially active children and adolescents decreased their PA more than those initially inactive (p>0.001), while those who met the sitting time recommendations increased more their sitting time during lockdown (p<0.001). The same applies to screen time (p<0.001). Live in urban was associated with a decrease of PA (p<0.001), an increase of their sitting time (p<0.001) and children's screen time (p=0.002) during lockdown. Conclusion: This study showed the deleterious effects of confinement caused by lockdown on physical activity and sedentary behaviors. Housing conditions were associated with lifestyle behaviors over this period of lockdown. Future public health policies should consider these results.","Chambonniere, PhD Student C; Lambert, C; Fearnbach, N; Tardieu, M; Fillon, A; Genin, P; Larras, B; Melsens, P; Bois, J; Pereira, B; Tremblay, A; Thivel, D; Duclos, M",Eur J Integr Med,854,23

Our reference projections suggest a pattern of decarbonization that will cause the reduction of 3.3 Mt until 2030 and 5.1 Mt between 2030 and 2050. This scenario allows us to assess effort required by the new IPCC goals to ensure carbon neutrality by 2050. For this objective to be achieved it is necessary for emissions to be reduced by 39.9 Mt by 2050. Our results suggest that of these, only 8.4 Mt will result from the inertia of the national emissions system. The remaining reduction on emissions of 31.5 Mt of CO(2) will require additional policy efforts. Accordingly, our results suggest that about 65.5% of the reductions necessary to achieve IPCC goals require deliberate policy efforts. Finally, the presence in the data of long memory with mean reversion suggests that policies must be persistent to ensure that these reductions in emissions are also permanent.","Belbute, José M.; Pereira, Alfredo M.",Energy Policy,854,13
