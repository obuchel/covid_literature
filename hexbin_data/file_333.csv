2002,Is There Any Role of Inhalational Corticosteroids in the Prophylaxis of Post-Traumatic Fat Embolism Syndrome?,2015-09-25,"Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is primarily a lung parenchymal disorder resulting from interstitial and alveolar inflammation triggered by the lipid metabolites in blood circulation. The 'low-dose' corticosteroid is supposed to have a prophylactic effect on the incidence of the FES and arterial hypoxemia by reducing this inflammatory response. It is expected that inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide aerosol) may prevent the development of hypoxemia or fat embolism syndrome in high-risk patients by reducing this inflammatory response. Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) steroid preparations can reach the lung parenchyma with minimal systemic effect. Sixty cases of polytrauma patients presenting within eight hours of injury were randomly allocated into one of the two groups. In Group 1 (n(1)=30) ciclesonide, 640 mcg, was given with a metered dose inhaler and repeated once again after 24 hours, whereas Group 2 (n(2)=30) was taken as control and observed for 72 hours for any episode of hypoxia. The outcome was assessed using Schonfeld’s criteria for the eventual outcome of subclinical or clinical FES. Out of 30 patients in each group, six patients developed subclinical FES, whereas three from ciclesonide prophylaxis group and eight from controls developed clinical FES. There is no statistical significance found between the eventual outcomes of subclinical or clinical FES between the ciclesonide prophylaxis and control group. Although there was a trend seen in the possible preventive efficacy of inhalational steroid in the present study, it did not reach the statistically significant level. The prophylactic role of inhalational steroid in post-traumatic subclinical and clinical FES is statistically insignificant in the present study.","Agarwal, Amit Kumar; Sen, Ramesh; Tripathy, Sujit K; Aggarwal, Sameer; G., Nirmalraj; Gupta, Dheeraj",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4627829/,333

6926,Critical care management of the lung transplant recipient,2012-06-22,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an accepted treatment strategy for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). We report our experience in a general hospital in Taiwan. From March 1985 to July 2001, 79 consecutive SAA patients, 46 male and 33 female, with a median age of 22 (4–43) years, received 80 courses of transplantation. Cyclophosphamide and total body radiation were used for the conditioning regimen, and cyclosporine-A and methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention. Patients were followed for a median of 39 months (from 8 days to 194 months). Myeloid and platelet engraftment occurred in a median of 15 (8–27) days and 18 (8–77) days, respectively. Three patients had primary and three patients secondary graft failure. Five patients (6.8%) had grade II–IV acute GVHD in 73 evaluable patients. Chronic GVHD occurred in 23 (34.8%) patients, with extensive stage in six. Only two patients had CMV disease. The projected 3- and 5-year overall survival rates estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method were 76.08 and 74.13%, respectively. Age at transplant, non-sibling donor, mononuclear cell dose, grade II–IV acute GVHD, interval from diagnosis to transplant, and red blood cell and platelet transfusion before transplant were poor prognostic factors for overall survival by univariate analysis. Grade II–IV acute GVHD was the only prognostic factor affecting overall survival after multivariate Cox regression analysis (P=0.040). In conclusion, SAA patients receiving HSCT have good long-term survival. The low incidence of acute GVHD in our patients may be related to ethnicity.","Bai, L. Y.; Chiou, T. J.; Liu, J. H.; Yen, C.

10846,"Propofol versus placebo (with rescue with ketamine) before less invasive surfactant administration: study protocol for a multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled trial (PROLISA)",2020-05-08,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for the treatment of adult severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) consist of high-quality evidence reports, but they are no longer accompanied by management protocols, as these require expert opinion to bridge the gap between published evidence and patient care. We aimed to establish a modern sTBI protocol for adult patients with both intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain oxygen monitors in place. METHODS: Our consensus working group consisted of 42 experienced and actively practicing sTBI opinion leaders from six continents. Having previously established a protocol for the treatment of patients with ICP monitoring alone, we addressed patients who have a brain oxygen monitor in addition to an ICP monitor. The management protocols were developed through a Delphi-method-based consensus approach and were finalized at an in-person meeting. RESULTS: We established three distinct treatment protocols, each with three tiers whereby higher tiers involve therapies with higher risk. One protocol addresses the management of ICP elevation when brain oxygenation is normal. A second addresses management of brain hypoxia with normal ICP. The third protocol addresses the situation when both intracranial hypertension and brain hypoxia are present. The panel considered issues pertaining to blood transfusion and ventilator management when designing the different algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: These protocols are intended to assist clinicians in the management of patients with both ICP and brain oxygen monitors but they do not reflect either a standard-of-care or a substitute for thoughtful individualized management. These protocols should be used in conjunction with recommendations for basic care, management of critical neuroworsening and weaning treatment recently published in conjunction with the Seattle International Brain Injury Consensus Conference.

14035,Cardiovascular and Quality of Life Outcomes of a 3-Month Physical Exercise Program in Two Brazilian Communities,2020-10-20,"During embryonic development, symmetric ectodermal thickenings [olfactory placodes (OP)] give rise to several cell types that comprise the olfactory system, such as those that form the terminal nerve ganglion (TN), gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 neurons (GnRH-1ns), and other migratory neurons in rodents. Even though the genetic heterogeneity among these cell types is documented, unidentified cell populations arising from the OP remain. One candidate to identify placodal derived neurons in the developing nasal area is the transcription factor Isl1, which was recently identified in GnRH-3 neurons of the terminal nerve in fish, as well as expression in neurons of the nasal migratory mass (MM). Here, we analyzed the Isl1 genetic lineage in chemosensory neuronal populations in the nasal area and migratory GnRH-1ns in mice using in situ hybridization, immunolabeling a Tamoxifen inducible Isl1Cre(ERT) and a constitutive Isl1(Cre) knock-in mouse lines. In addition, we also performed conditional Isl1 ablation in developing GnRH neurons. We found Isl1 lineage across non-sensory cells of the respiratory epithelium and sustentacular cells of OE and VNO. We identified a population of transient embryonic Isl1 + neurons in the olfactory epithelium and sparse Isl1 + neurons in postnatal VNO. Isl1 is expressed in almost all GnRH neurons and in approximately half of the other neuron populations in the MM. However, Isl1 conditional ablation alone does not significantly compromise GnRH-1 neuronal migration or GnRH-1 expression, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Further studies will elucidate the functional and mechanistic role of Isl1 in development of migratory endocrine neurons.","Taroc, Ed Zandro M.; Katreddi, Raghu Ram; Forni, Paolo E.",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609815/,333
15333,Personalized Multimorbidity Management for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Using Reinforcement Learning of Electronic Health Records,2021-02-11,"Background: Previous research has shown that bereaved individuals are at risk of developing physical and mental health problems. However, knowledge is scarce about the associations between severe grief reactions after bereavement and physical and mental health problems and the use of health services. Objectives: The present study sought to investigate the prevalence of severe grief reactions and to study the associations of severe grief reactions with mental and physical health and health care utilization. Method: The sample comprised 20,453 adults aged 40 and above (mean age = 57.2 years, SD = 11.3 years, 52.4% female) who participated in the seventh wave of the Tromsø study. Severe grief was assessed with one question asking whether the respondent has experienced the death of a loved one and currently has difficulty accepting the loss, yearns for the deceased, and experiences intense emotional pain related to the loss. Furthermore, participants answered questions about their current physical health, mental health (Hopkins Symptom Checklist – 10), and the use of health services in the past year. Results: Overall, 5.2% of the participants reported severe grief after a loss in childhood, 25.9% after bereavement in adulthood and 4.1% after bereavement in the previous year. Female gender, higher age, living without a partner, non-Norwegian ethnicity, and lower socio-economic status were associated with severe grief. Severe grief reactions were negatively related to self-reported health, predicted positively current levels of depression and anxiety, and were positively associated with the use of health services. Effect sizes were small. Gender differences in the use of health services were observed. Conclusion: Severe grief reactions are common in individuals aged 40 and older and associated with self-reported physical and mental health problems as well as increased use of health services. Health service providers should be attentive to possible severe grief in connection with health complaints.","Thimm, Jens C.; Kristoffersen, Agnete Egilsdatter; Ringberg, Unni",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7748058/,333
15960,Understanding parents’ decision-making on participation in clinical trials in children’s heart surgery: a qualitative study,2021-02-23,"CONTEXT: Poria coco F.A.Wolf (Polyporaceae) dispels dampness and promotes diuresis implying hypouricaemic action. OBJECTIVE: To examine hypouricaemic action of Poria coco. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol extract (PCE) was prepared by extracting the sclerotium of P. cocos with ethanol, and the water extract (PCW) was produced by bathing the remains with water. PCE and PCW (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) were orally administered to hyperuricemic Kunming mice (n = 8) to examine its hypouricaemic effect. Also, molecular docking was performed. RESULTS: P. cocos showed excellent hypouricaemic action, decreasing the serum uric acid of hyperuricaemia (HUA) control (526 ± 112 μmol/L) to 178 ± 53, 153 ± 57 and 151 ± 62 μmol/L (p < 0.01) by PCE and 69 ± 23, 63 ± 15 and 62 ± 20 μmol/L (p < 0.01) by PCW, respectively. According to SCrs, BUNs and H&E staining, PCE and PCW partially attenuated renal dysfunction caused by HUA. They presented no negative effects on ALT, AST and ALP activities. They elevated ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette super-family G member 2) mRNA and protein expression in comparison to HUA control. In molecular docking, compound 267, 277, 13824, 15730 and 5759 were predicted as the top bioactives of P. cocos against HUA, which even presented better scores than the positive compound, oestrone 3-sulfate. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This paper demonstrated the hypouricaemic and nephroprotective effects of P. cocos in hyperuricemic mice by up-regulating ABCG2. These results may be useful for the development of a hypouricaemic agent.","Liang, Danling; Yong, Tianqiao; Diao, Xue; Chen, Shaodan; Chen, Diling; Xiao, Chun; Zuo, Dan; Xie, Yizhen; Zhou, Xinxin; Hu, Huiping",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928048/,333
16438,Executive Functions in Tobacco Use Disorder: New Challenges and Opportunities,2021-03-15,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes a chronic inflammatory intestinal disease, called Johne's disease (JD) in many ruminants. In the dairy industry, JD is responsible for significant economic losses due to decreased milk production and premature culling of infected animals. Test-and-cull strategy in conjunction with risk management is currently recommended for JD control in dairy herds. However, current diagnostic tests are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and/or too difficult to operate on site. In this study, we developed a new method for the detection of anti-M. paratuberculosis antibodies from sera of M. paratuberculosis-infected animals. M. paratuberculosis antigen-coated magnetic beads were sequentially reacted with bovine serum followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibody. The reaction of HRP with its substrate was then quantitatively measured electrochemically using a redox-active probe, ferrocyanide. After optimization of electrochemical conditions and concentration of the redox-active probe, we showed that the new electrochemical detection method could distinguish samples of M. paratuberculosis-infected cattle from those of uninfected cattle with greater separation between the two groups of samples when compared with a conventional colorimetric testing method. Since electrochemical detection can be conducted with an inexpensive, battery-operated portable device, this new method may form a basis for the development of an on-site diagnostic system for JD.","Hatate, Kaoru; Rice, J.

Additionally to these functional roles, T and B cell lymphocytes rely on the diversity of their receptor chains to recognize different pathogens. The lymphocyte subclasses emerge from common ancestors generated with the same diversity of receptors during selection processes. Here, we leverage biophysical models of receptor generation with machine learning models of selection to identify specific sequence features characteristic of functional lymphocyte repertoires and subrepertoires. Specifically, using only repertoire-level sequence information, we classify CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, find correlations between receptor chains arising during selection, and identify T cell subsets that are targets of pathogenic epitopes. We also show examples of when simple linear classifiers do as well as more complex machine learning methods.","Isacchini, Giulio; Walczak, Aleksandra M.; Mora, Thierry; Nourmohammad, Armita",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8040596/,333
17630,Barriers and facilitators to reporting deaths following Ebola surveillance in Sierra Leone: implications for sustainable mortality surveillance based on an exploratory qualitative assessment,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Oral bleeding after dental extraction in patients on non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is a frequent problem. We investigated whether 10% tranexamic acid (TXA) mouthwash decreases post-extraction bleeding in patients treated with NOACs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The EXTRACT-NOAC study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned to 10% TXA or placebo mouthwash and were instructed to use the mouthwash once prior to dental extraction, and thereafter for 3 times a day for 3 days. The primary outcome was the number of patients with any post-extraction oral bleeding up to day 7. Secondary outcomes included periprocedural, early, and delayed bleeding, and the safety outcomes included all thrombotic events. The first patient was randomized on February 9, 2018 and the last patient on March 12, 2020. Of 222 randomized patients, 218 patients were included in the full analysis set, of which 106 patients were assigned to TXA (74.8 (±8.8) years; 81 men) and 112 to placebo (72.7 (±10.7) years; 64 men). Post-extraction bleeding occurred in 28 (26.4%) patients in the TXA group and in 32 (28.6%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.42; P = 0.72). There were 46 bleeds in the TXA group and 85 bleeds in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.05; P = 0.07). TXA did not reduce the rate of periprocedural bleeding (bleeding score 4 ± 1.78 versus 4 ± 1.82, P = 0.80) and early bleeding (rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.37). Delayed bleeding (rate ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.89) and bleeding after multiple extractions (rate ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78) were lower in the TXA group. One patient in the placebo group had a transient ischemic attack while interrupting the NOAC therapy in preparation for the dental extraction. Two of the study limitations were the premature interruption of the trial following a futility analysis and the assessment of the patients’ compliance that was based on self-reported information during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients on NOACs undergoing dental extraction, TXA does not seem to reduce the rate of periprocedural or early postoperative oral bleeding compared to placebo. TXA appears to reduce delayed bleeds and postoperative oral bleeding if multiple teeth are extracted.

19100,Children’s understanding of epilepsy: A qualitative study,2021-07-11,"BACKGROUND: The menstrual cycle influences HIV infection-risk in women, although the timing and underlying mechanism are unclear. Here we investigated the contribution of the menstrual cycle to HIV susceptibility through evaluating immune behavior with infection-risk over time. METHODS: Blood and vaginal lavage samples were collected from 18 pig-tailed macaques to evaluate immune changes over reproductive cycles, and from 5 additional animals undergoing repeated vaginal exposures to simian HIV (SHIV). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from healthy women (n = 10) were prospectively collected over the course of a menstrual cycle to profile T cell populations. Immune properties from PBMC and vaginal lavage samples were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma progesterone was measured by enzyme immunoassay. The oscillation frequency of progesterone concentration and CCR5 expression on CD4 T cells was calculated using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. SHIV infection was monitored in plasma by RT-PCR. Immune measures were compared using generalized estimating equations (GEE). FINDINGS: Macaques cycle-phases were associated with fluctuations in systemic immune properties and a type-1 inflammatory T cell response with corresponding CCR5+ memory CD4 T cell (HIV target cell) infiltration into the vaginal lumen at the late luteal phase. Power spectral analysis identified CCR5 oscillation frequencies synchronized with reproductive cycles. In a repetitive low-dose vaginal challenge model, productive SHIV(163P3) infection only occurred during intervals of mounting type-1 T cell responses (n = 5/5). Finally, we identify similar type-1 inflammatory T cell responses over the menstrual cycle are occurring in healthy women. INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that periodic shifts in the immune landscape under menstrual cycle regulation drives bystander CCR5+ CD4 T cell recruitment and HIV susceptibility in the female reproductive tract.

19516,"Behavioral and Sociodemographic Determinants of Hypertension and Its Burden among Bank Employees in Metropolitan Cities of Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia",2021-07-16,"PURPOSE: To describe the management of arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) in severe traumatic brain-injured (TBI) patients, and the optimal target of PaCO(2) in patients with high intracranial pressure (ICP). METHODS: Secondary analysis of CENTER-TBI, a multicentre, prospective, observational, cohort study. The primary aim was to describe current practice in PaCO(2) management during the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) after TBI, focusing on the lowest PaCO(2) values. We also assessed PaCO(2) management in patients with and without ICP monitoring (ICP(m)), and with and without intracranial hypertension. We evaluated the effect of profound hyperventilation (defined as PaCO(2) < 30 mmHg) on long-term outcome. RESULTS: We included 1100 patients, with a total of 11,791 measurements of PaCO(2) (5931 lowest and 5860 highest daily values). The mean (± SD) PaCO(2) was 38.9 (± 5.2) mmHg, and the mean minimum PaCO(2) was 35.2 (± 5.3) mmHg. Mean daily minimum PaCO(2) values were significantly lower in the ICP(m) group (34.5 vs 36.7 mmHg, p < 0.001). Daily PaCO(2) nadir was lower in patients with intracranial hypertension (33.8 vs 35.7 mmHg, p < 0.001). Considerable heterogeneity was observed between centers. Management in a centre using profound hyperventilation (HV) more frequently was not associated with increased 6 months mortality (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.77–1.45, p value = 0.7166), or unfavourable neurological outcome (OR 1.12, 95% CI = 0.90–1.38, p value = 0.3138). CONCLUSIONS: Ventilation is manipulated differently among centers and in response to intracranial dynamics. PaCO(2) tends to be lower in patients with ICP monitoring, especially if ICP is increased. Being in a centre which more frequently uses profound hyperventilation does not affect patient outcomes.

Accordingly, two new series of 3-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one and 3-methylquinoxaline-2-thiol derivatives were designed to act as VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The designed derivatives were synthesised and evaluated in vitro as cytotoxic agents against two human cancer cell lines namely, HepG-2 and MCF-7. Also, the synthesised derivatives were assessed for their VEGFR-2inhibitory effect. The most promising member 11e were further investigated to reach a valuable insight about its apoptotic effect through cell cycle and apoptosis analyses. Moreover, deep investigations were carried out for compound 11e using western-plot analyses to detect its effect against some apoptotic and apoptotic parameters including caspase-9, caspase-3, BAX, and Bcl-2. Many in silico investigations including docking, ADMET, toxicity studies were performed to predict binding affinity, pharmacokinetic, drug likeness, and toxicity of the synthesised compounds. The results revealed that compounds 11e, 11g, 12e, 12g, and 12k exhibited promising cytotoxic activities (IC(50) range is 2.1 − 9.8 µM), comparing to sorafenib (IC(50) = 3.4 and 2.2 µM against MCF-7 and HepG2, respectively).

19924,"Support model for nurses caring for people living with HIV and AIDS in the Limpopo province, South Africa",2021-07-06,"The molecular mechanisms of olfaction, or the sense of smell, are relatively underexplored compared with other sensory systems, primarily because of its underlying molecular complexity and the limited availability of dedicated predictive computational tools. Odorant receptors (ORs) allow the detection and discrimination of a myriad of odorant molecules and therefore mediate the first step of the olfactory signaling cascade. To date, odorant (or agonist) information for the majority of these receptors is still unknown, limiting our understanding of their functional relevance in odor-induced behavioral responses. In this study, we introduce OdoriFy, a Web server featuring powerful deep neural network–based prediction engines. OdoriFy enables (1) identification of odorant molecules for wildtype or mutant human ORs (Odor Finder); (2) classification of user-provided chemicals as odorants/nonodorants (Odorant Predictor); (3) identification of responsive ORs for a query odorant (OR Finder); and (4) interaction validation using Odorant–OR Pair Analysis. In addition, OdoriFy provides the rationale behind every prediction it makes by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence. This module highlights the basis of the prediction of odorants/nonodorants at atomic resolution and for the ORs at amino acid levels. A key distinguishing feature of OdoriFy is that it is built on a comprehensive repertoire of manually curated information of human ORs with their known agonists and nonagonists, making it a highly interactive and resource-enriched Web server. Moreover, comparative analysis of OdoriFy predictions with an alternative structure-based ligand interaction method revealed comparable results.

33350,Challenging the Status Quo: Increasing Diversity in Dermatology,2020-05-31,"This paper addresses the subject of Movie Recommendation Systems, focusing on two of the most well-known filtering techniques, Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering. The first approach proposes a supervised probabilistic Bayesian model that forms recommendations based on the previous evaluations of other movies the user has watched. The second approach composes an unsupervised learning technique that forms clusters of users, using the K-Means algorithm, based on their preference of different movie genres, as it is expressed through their ratings. Both of the above approaches are compared to each other as well as to a basic method known as Weighted Sum, which makes predictions based on the cosine similarity and the euclidean distance between users and movies. In addition, Content-based Filtering is implemented through K-Means clustering techniques that focus on identifying the resemblance between movie plots. The first approach clusters movies according to the Tf/Idf weighting scheme, applying weights to the terms of movie plots. The latter identifies the likeness between movie plots, utilizing the BM25 algorithm. The efficiency of the above methods is calculated through the Accuracy metric.","Iliopoulou, Konstantina; Kanavos, Andreas; Ilias, Aristidis; Makris, Christos; Vonitsanos, Gerasimos",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256369/,333

This scenario calls for a significant return to organizational design studies that embrace a holistic approach, especially those focusing on the simultaneous interaction of multiple design elements. Organizational life cycle (OLC) models provide a fitting response to this call. In this paper, we review the organizational design characteristics of five seminal OLC models. We show that according to these OLC models, growth in size—which is described as unavoidable—generates business issues that firms are forced to solve by adopting only one possible organizational configuration, here following a deterministic organizational approach. We challenge this approach and propose conceiving of OLC as an evolutionary process, which calls for a variety of equifinal organizational solutions. We conclude by proposing future research avenues.","Mosca, Luigi; Gianecchini, Martina; Campagnolo, Diego",J Org Design,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817070/,333

In this paper, I argue that this social connection model is far less realistic and socially effective than it aims to be.

Nurturing the MSRI’s progress in Egypt are economic and political needs on the Egyptian side such as the need to obtain additional capital, develop infrastructure, and diversify political partners. Still, despite Egypt’s long-standing ties with China and China’s strong interest in Egypt, the results in terms of project completion and achievements nowhere near approach the grand headlines. Limited results on the ground to date have much to do with Egypt’s economic weaknesses, governance problems, and domestic instability which limit the resources Egypt can bring to bear on implementing the MSRI and deter China and Chinese firms from devoting more resources to Egypt.","Chaziza, Mordechai","China&#x02019;s Maritime Silk Road Initiative, Africa, and the Middle East",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978950/,333

Continuous exposure to elevated concentration of NO(2) may impose development of asthma and potentially increase in susceptibility to respiratory infections in humans. The present study examined impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 in terms of spatial and temporal variation of tropospheric NO(2) in Indo-Gangetic plain. The results showed steep reduction in tropospheric NO(2) as a result of ceased industrial and economic activities. Analysis of Sentinel-5P satellite data was carried out for specific period during 2019–2020 at a regional scale and for major industrial cities. Tremendous positive impact of lockdown in atmospheric condition is observed, wherein NO(2) concentration has gone down by 20–40% in all major cities except few exceptions were noticed. The concomitant impact of Covid-19 has ensued pragmatic constructive impact on environment and climate, due to drop in NO(2) emissions.","Sur, Koyel; Verma, Vipan Kumar; Pateriya, Brijendra",Spat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8019090/,333

First, we estimate a multifactor model for changes in credit default swap (CDS) spreads over 2014 to June 2019. Then, we apply a synthetic control-type procedure to extrapolate model-implied changes in CDS. The factor model does very well over the rest of 2019 but breaks down during the pandemic, especially during March 2020. We find that the March 2020 divergence is well accounted for by COVID-specific risks and associated policies, mortality outcomes, and policy announcements, rather than traditional determinants. Daily CDS widening ceased almost immediately after the European Central Bank announced the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, but the divergence between actual and model-implied changes persisted. This points to COVID-19 Dominance—widening spreads during the pandemic has led to unconventional monetary policies that primarily aim to mitigate short-run fears, temporarily pushing away concerns over fiscal risk.","Jinjarak, Yothin; Ahmed, Rashad; Nair-Desai, Sameer; Xin, Weining; Aizenman, Joshua",Oxf Econ Pap,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083783/,333

52820,The impact of the initial wave of COVID-19 pandemic on children under endoscopic esophageal dilatation protocol: a single center study,2021-05-12,"OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality within the healthcare system and remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A major issue in the diagnosis of sepsis is understanding the pathophysiologic mechanism, which revolves around host immune system activation and dysregulated responses. African Americans are more likely to experience severe sepsis with higher mortality rates compared to the general population. This pilot study characterized multiple inflammatory markers and proteases in plasma of primarily African American and Afro-Caribbean patients with mild sepsis. METHODS: Plasma was collected from 16 healthy controls and 15 subjects presenting with sepsis, on admission, and again upon resolution of the signs of sepsis, defined as a resolution of sepsis criteria. Plasma samples were analyzed for cytokines, chemokines, and proteases using multiplex bead assays. RESULTS: Elevated levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-10, interleukin-15, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-8, interferon gamma-induced protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, matrix metallopeptidase 12, and cathepsin S were identified in plasma from sepsis patients on admission compared to control subjects. Interleukin-6, interleukin-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and cathepsin S were reduced in sepsis patients upon clinical resolution of sepsis. CONCLUSION: These findings profile the circulating inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and proteases in African Americans and Afro-Caribbean patients during sepsis. The role of these targets in sepsis needs addressing in this patient population.","Borhanjoo, Panid; Singh, Navneet; Nath, Sridesh; Chowdhury, MD Sadakat; Swanson, Carl; Kaiser, Ryan; Geraghty, Patrick; Foronjy, Robert F; Chow, Lillian",SAGE Open Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107660/,333

It catalogues the four tenets of the energy justice concept—distributive, recognition, procedural, and restorative—and shows how they relate to inequities in energy affordability, availability, due process, sustainability, and responsibility. RECENT FINDINGS: Energy storage systems have been deployed to support grid reliability and renewable resource integration, but there is additional emerging value in considering the connections between energy storage applications and equity challenges in the power system. Through a thorough review of the energy justice and energy transitions literature, this paper offers the equity dimensions of storage project design and implementations. SUMMARY: Emerging energy programs and projects are utilizing energy storage in pursuit of improved equity outcomes. Future research and policy design should integrate energy justice principles to align storage penetration with desired equity outcomes.","Tarekegne, Bethel; O’Neil, Rebecca; Twitchell, Jeremy",Curr Sustainable Renewable Energy Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8134812/,333
53217,459 Implication of Changes in Management of Acute Pancreatitis During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background: Diabetes Mellitus is a factor for the development of micronagiopathies, it is well known at the level of retina, renal and peripheral nervous system. However, it is important to mention that high levels of glucose have deleterious effects on the walls of the vessels, causing microangiopathic damage to the lung, consequently this leads to pulmonary dysfunction. There is local oxidative stress, increased vascular permeability, producing changes in the secretion of the mucus that leads to reduced lung volumes, lung diffusion capacity, decrease bronchodilation. Knowing this complication at the pulmonary level derived from poor control of Diabetes Mellitus, diabetic pulmonary microangiopathy represents a challenge for the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a high prevalence of diabetic patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and the complications derived from this, that is why the idea arose to carry out this review and evaluate the impact that admission glucose levels have on the clinical evolution and prognosis of these patients. Elevated serum glucose levels have deleterious effects on the walls of blood vessels, leading to microangiopathy. Such a destructive process also involves the pulmonary circulation, where it is known as diabetic pulmonary microangiopathy. This hypothesis has been confirmed in histopathological examinations of the lung parenchyma, as well as in lung function tests. However, until now there have been no clinical implications of these findings.(1) Histopathological evidence of pulmonary involvement in subjects with diabetes mellitus has included thickened pulmonary capillary basal plates and alveolar epithelial plates, the latter suggesting existing pulmonary microangiopathy. Abnormal lung function has been detected in some diabetic patients. Glycosylation-induced non-enzymatic alteration of lung connective tissue is the most likely pathogenetic mechanism underlying mechanical lung dysfunction in diabetic subjects. while the most sustainable explanation for altered pulmonary microangiopathy.(2) Metodos: This short review looks at the main findings, prospective cross-sectional analytical study, in Guatemala Central America that included 319 patients with COVID 19, hospitalized with comorbidities like type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension and chronic kidney disease as medical history. These patients did not have a history of pulmonary pathology and who required a low- and high-flow oxygen device since admission, presenting moderate and severe COVID-19. These laboratories were carried out in the first chemistry performed after the onset of respiratory symptoms in the arrival at the hospital. Chi square was used for categorical variables and t student for numeric variables for the rest of the variables. Results: The study showed that in the severe group of patients the median age was 52 years old and in the moderate group it was 51. In the severe group of patients, a male gender predominance with 50.7% and 49.3% in moderate; showing the female sex 46% and 53% respectively. Regarding glucose levels at admission, there was a mean of 189mg / dl for severe patients and 156 mg / dl in moderate patients, with a P: 0.021. Conclusion: The primary point in this study is to see how the correlation was measured since they had to be two numerical variables for it to be correlation. In this case, blood glucose and vascular damage, the most severe cases were related to blood glucose levels greater than 125 mg/dl. In our study, we conclude that the presence of glycemic levels below 125 mg/dl is a protective factor with respect to mortality with an OR 0.521 (CL 0.324–0.835, Po.007). That means, that those patients who are admitted with glycemic levels greater than 126 mg/d have twice the risk to die at 28 days of admission than those who do not have levels greater than 125mg/dl. In the same way, those patients who were admitted with less than 95% saturation were compared and there was no significant difference OR 1.174 (0.492–2.806, p0.822). 1.

53225,94 An Observational Cohort Study to Evaluate Volume and Severity of Emergency General Surgery Admissions During The COVID-19 Pandemic: Is There A “Lockdown” Effect?,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND: To stop Coronavirus-19 pandemic, Spanish government ordained home confinement in Basque Country from 13th March to 11th May, although some people had previously confined themselves. In this period, a decrease in cardiovascular admissions, except pulmonary embolism has been reported, speculating about viral activation of coagulation. As patients could not receive the standard care, augmented mortality of non-Covid pathologies could happen. METHODS: We, selected patients admitted with intermediate-high and high risk from 1st March to 30th June. Other risks or those occurred during a hospitalization were excluded. Several characteristics were reported. RESULTS: Among 21 cases (13 women), there were 3 Covid-positive (2 women). All presented an intermediate-high risk, except 2. 16 cases happened in March and April. Mean age was 72,5 years (range 30-94). Mean total stay length was 7,24 days (range 3-12). 14 patients presented original Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) class ≥ III and mean simplified PESI (sPESI) was 1.43 points (range 0-4). On average, patients presented 1,95 risk factors for pulmonary embolism (range 0-6), mainly weak ones. Average Troponin T was 130.15 ng/L (range 15-1099, one case unknown). Average NT-proBNP was 6690.42 pg/ml (range 267-35000, 2 cases unknown). Fibrinolytic therapy and vasopressors were only used in intensive care unit (ICU), in 2 and 1 patients respectively. 2 patients were on Unfractionated Heparin, the rest received low-molecular-weight heparin. All patients admitted in ICU were transferred later to ward, except 1 that was transfer to Intermediate respiratory care unit (IRCU). There were no mortality during hospitalization. There were 3 complications that not required intensive therapy. 8 were admitted in ICU (50% women, mean age 61,2 years (range 30-78), average sPESI 1,4 (range 0-4), 6 patients PESI class ≥ III, average troponin 109,25 ng/L (19-259) and NT-proBNP 7219.86 pg/ml (446-15787), 1,88 risk factors on average, stay length 8,25 days (6-11)). The rest were admitted in ward (4 in IRCU) (62% women, mean age 79.46 years (66-94), average sPESI 1,46 (0-4), 8 patients PESI class ≥ III, average troponin 144,08 ng/L (15-1099) and NT-proBNP 6351.58 pg/ml (439-35000), 2 risk factors on average, stay length 6,62 days (3-12)). CONCLUSIONS: Probably coronavirus-19 is not a risk factor for admission due to severe pulmonary embolism. Home confinement may be a risk factor, and if it happened again, advice against sedentary lifestyle should be given to population. Despite a possible delay in diagnosis or treatment, there were no mortality or severe complications, irrespectively of age or site of admission, although patients in intensive care tend to be younger, presented more frequently PESI class > III and stay more time in hospital. Studies are needed to determine which patients would benefit from admission in intensive care units, especially if resources are limited again.","Sanz Ortega, I; Chasco Eguilaz, L; Ballaz Quincoces, A; Jodar Samper, A; Rodriguez Sanchez, I; Velasco Del Castillo, S; Salcedo Arruti, A; Espana Yandiola, PP",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135307/,333
53245,664 The ICON Trauma Study: The Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Major Trauma Workload in the UK,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Rheumatologists are facing a significant challenge in the management of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to limitations placed on outpatient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequent clinical assessments of disease activity are recommended during implementation of the treat to target strategy to achieve remission. A biomarker indicating response to methotrexate during the early phase of therapy could complement clinical examination. Methotrexate increases erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is measured routinely, prompting us to investigate whether changes in MCV could act as an early indicator of response. Methods Patients with early RA who were started on methotrexate therapy were included from two independent cohorts. The larger cohort (discovery cohort, n = 655) was used to build the model and the second cohort (validation cohort, n = 225) was applied to test the prediction of the model. Conventional statistical, and machine learning approaches were adopted to identify key determinants that influence the potential relationship between MCV and clinical response, defined as attainment of remission or low disease activity, at six months after starting methotrexate. Results A LASSO penalised logistic regression model was built with the discovery cohort [area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve = 0.76], where change of MCV from three months [Odds ratio (OR) 1.53 (95% CI 1.38-1.70)], concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine [OR 2.16 (95% CI 1.52 - 3.07, p < 0.001)], and seropositivity [OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.12 - 3.03, p = 0.02)] were associated with favourable methotrexate response [accuracy 81% (95% CI 76%-86%) of the model testing against discovery model]. Different machine learning classification methods were applied. Random forest exhibited the maximum accuracy and AUROC (89%, and 86%, respectively), confirming the above three predictors as the most significant. Two latent classes (class 1: smaller MCV increase and class 2: greater MCV increase) were identified based on the MCV changes over six months. Class 1 had fewer responders and a lower number of patients on hydroxychloroquine compared to class 2. The earliest time point of significant difference of MCV between responders and non-responders was three months [mean difference 1.43 (95% CI 0.57-2.3)]. Combination hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate caused the greatest increase in MCV with a difference between responders and non-responders at 2 months. Change of MCV at three months showed AUROC of 0.75 to predict treatment response to the combination of methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine at six months with an optimal cut-point of MCV 3.5 fL (95% CI 3.5-3.6) with 71% sensitivity and 75%, specificity. Conclusion Our data provides mechanistic insight into the synergistic clinical benefit of concomitant hydroxychloroquine with methotrexate, boosting the rise in erythrocyte MCV which could serve as an early biomarker of treatment response.

53254,468 Management of Acute Appendicitis During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single NHS Centre Study,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Evaluation of skin is central to both clinical practice and trials in systemic sclerosis (SSc). This is generally done with the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). Remote consultations are now widely implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has inevitably limited evaluation of skin. To monitor skin during this pandemic and to further explore ways to assess skin, we developed the PASTUL (Patient self-Assessment of Skin Thickness in Upper Limb) questionnaire. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and validity of the PASTUL in SSc. Methods The PASTUL questionnaire specifies a simple grading of skin as normal, mild, moderate, or severely thickened at eight sites of upper limb corresponding to mRSS. Assessed grades were converted to an integer scale [0, 1, 2, 3]. Detailed instructions for patients were provided. Scleroderma Skin PRO (SSPRO) and Scleroderma Health Assessment Disability Index (SHAQ-DI) were also completed. The mRSS was done in a selection of patients. Construct validity was evaluated by examining the correlation between PASTUL, mRSS, SSPRO and SHAQ-DI using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Content validity was evaluated by scoring relevance, clarity and practical difficulty. Test-retest reliability was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results In total, 107 patients were invited of which 83 (77.6%) completed the questionnaires. The mRSS was undertaken in 61 patients. The PASTUL was completed by patients (83.1%) or by a partner/friend (16.9%). Mean PASTUL score was 11 (SD 6), mean HAQ-DI 1.47 (SD 0.76) and mean SSPRO 49.8 (SD 26.6). PASTUL and SSPRO physical limitations correlated strongly (0.62, p < 0.001). Correlations between PASTUL and total SSPRO and mRSS upper limbs were moderate to weak (0.59, 0.50 and 0.32 respectively). Correlation between PASTUL and mRSS was stronger in lcSSc compared to dcSSc patients (0.61 vs 0.29) and when assessed by a partner/friend compared to patients themselves (0.98 vs 0.45). The PASTUL demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability (ICC of 0.92) and good content validity. Conclusion Moderate and significant correlations of PASTUL scores with total SSPRO, physical limitation scores and mRSS support the usefulness of PASTUL as an outcome measure and indicates it’s potential for use in virtual clinical settings Disclosure J.

53302,720 Outcomes of Conservative Management of Acute Appendicitis During The COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent form of liver disease. Observational studies documented associations of NAFLD with several chronic and infectious diseases but whether these associations underlie causal effects is unknown. The molecular mechanisms and genetic architecture of NAFLD are poorly understood. Our objectives were to identify genetic loci associated with NAFLD and determine whether the presence of NAFLD was causally associated with human diseases. Methods: We created a NAFLD genetic instrument through the identification of independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with NAFLD in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) (6715 cases and 682,748 controls). Using inverse-variance weighted Mendelian Randomization (MR), we investigated the impact of NAFLD on human disease-related phenotypes in the UK Biobank and FinnGen cohorts as well as in the COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Results: We first performed a GWAS meta-analysis of four cohorts and found variants significantly associated with NAFLD (p<5.0E-8) at six genetic loci (MTARC1, GCKR, TRIB1, LMO3, SUGP1 [TM6SF2] and PNPLA3). Using a risk factor informed Bayesian approach (bGWAS), we identify variants at three additional loci (LPL, FTO, and APOE). To determine if the association between NAFLD and human diseases shows evidence of causality, we performed MR across the human disease-related phenome (>800 diseases) using a genetic instrument for NAFLD. Results of these analyses suggest that NAFLD was not causally associated with diseases outside the spectrum of liver diseases. We also found no causal association between genetically predicted NAFLD and COVID-19-related outcomes. Conclusions: This study identified several new genetic loci associated with NAFLD. NAFLD was not causally associated with diseases outside those of the spectrum of liver diseases. This finding suggests that the resolution of NAFLD might not prevent other diseases previously associated with NAFLD.","Ghodsian, Nooshin; Abner, Erik; Gobeil, Émilie; Taba, Nele; Amand, Alexis St-; Perrot, Nicolas; Couture, Christian; Bossé, Yohan; Mitchell, Patricia; Vohl, Marie-Claude; Thériault, Sébastien; Tchernof, André; Esko, Tõnu; Mathieu, Patrick; Arsenault, Benoit",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135512/,333
53328,755 Elective Surgery in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Outcomes of 100 Consecutive Cases,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Alemtuzumab is an efficacious therapy for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) preventing neural damage and reducing relapse rate by up to 74%. Administered in 2 treatment cycles 12 months apart and authorised for use in > 40 countries, it is a humanized monoclonal antibody selectively directed against the CD52 antigen of T- and B-Lymphocytes. Significant autoimmune effects of Alemtuzumab are reported 6-60 months post-treatment including secondary autoimmunity (40%), thyroid disease (18-26%), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (1-3%) and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (1%). There are 2 case reports of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis(HLH) in people with MS triggered by Alemtuzumab. HLH is a clinical syndrome of dysregulated, pathological overactivation of innate immunity leading to cytokine storm, multi-organ failure and a very high mortality rate. Clinical features are difficult to distinguish from, and may coexist with, other syndromes such as sepsis. Recognition requires a high index of clinical suspicion and management through multidisciplinary teams (MDT) using immune suppression. Early recognition and treatment improve outcome. Methods We report a case of HLH in a 30-year-old female 1 year after her first cycle of alemtuzumab (second cycle delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic) for treatment of RRMS. She was well until presentation 2 days post gadolinium-contrasted routine MRI head scan with headache, fever, bacterial pneumonia/empyema and acute kidney injury. Febrile episodes persisted despite antibiotics. Results Investigations revealed hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia (Haemoglobin: 80g/L, WBC: 0.9x10(9)/L, neutrophils: 0.67x10(9)/L, lymphocytes: 0.14 X10(9)/L, platelets: 82x10(9)/L), hypertriglyceridaemia (5.5mmol/L) and hyperferritinaemia (94023ng/ml). She fulfilled the Histiocyte Society HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria for HLH (H-score: 238). Initial treatment was IV methylprednisolone (1g) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2g/kg. Ferritin levels initially decreased (66933ng/ml) but re-escalated (93912ng/ml) with clinical deterioration, necessitating additional treatment with subcutaneous Anakinra 4mg/kg(recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) alongside oral prednisolone 1mg/kg. There was rapid, sustained improvement with resolution of fever but ferritin levels remained highly elevated (45000ng/ml) and cytopaenia was slow to resolve. Marker T cell subsets showed significant T cell depression presumably post-alemtuzumab. MDT discussion locally and nationally through the HLH Across Speciality Collaboration (HASC) led to discharge with careful outpatient monitoring. Further IVIG 2g/kg was administered which led to complete resolution of HLH and treatment wean. Conclusion HLH is an under-recognised complication of alemtuzumab therapy. Severe HLH requires both cytokine storm-directed treatment and identification/treatment of the trigger. Here, HLH was refractory to first line therapy (steroids and IVIG) and required immune modulation. The combination of alemtuzumab-induced immune dysregulation and sepsis were likely triggers, rather than Gadolinium. Supportive regional and national MDT input were required to guide therapy, especially as the patient wished to avoid etoposide (a standard refractory-HLH therapy) to preserve fertility. MDT working enabled early discharge with close monitoring in ambulatory care - a preferred outcome in the coronavirus pandemic. Disclosure N.L.

Home-based programs, although less effective than supervised programs, have been found to be successful when conducted at high intensity by walking near maximal pain. In this randomized trial, we aim to compare a low-intensity, pain-free structured home-based exercise (SHB) program to an active control group that will be advised to walk according to guidelines. Sixty PAD patients aged > 60 years with claudication will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio to SHB or Control. Patients in the training group will be prescribed an interval walking program at controlled speed to be performed at home; the speed will be increased weekly. At baseline and after 6 months, the following outcomes will be collected: pain-free walking distance and 6-min walking distance (primary outcome), ankle-brachial index, QoL by the VascuQoL-6 questionnaire, foot temperature by thermal camera, 5-time sit-to-stand test, and long-term clinical outcomes including revascularization rate and mortality.

Zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) are one of the most capable porous nanocarriers that need a biocompatible template to be used in biomedical applications. In this work, Zr-MOF was synthesized into the wool fabric through in-situ one-pot method with different molar ratios. The final fabrics were characterized thoroughly using various techniques and the effect of components on monodispersity and nucleation tendency of Zr-MOF onto the surface of wool were explained. The resultant fabric stablished absolute wash durability, increased air-permeability up to twice and reasonable hydrophilicity. Tensile strength and young modulus decreased 30 and 1244 % and strain increased 66 %. Salvia Officinalis (SO) and Calendula Officinalis (CO) extracts were loaded onto the modified fabrics with 1154 and 1842 % increased absorption capacity. The release profiles showed domination of diffusion mechanism. The wool-MOF-SO and CO displayed both 100 % antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and 60.95 and 64.64 % against Staphylococcus aureus because of diverse antibacterial components. Calendula Officinalis proved biocompatibility with human skin however Salvia Officinalis exhibited high toxicity.","Rezaee, Reihane; Montazer, Majid; Mianehro, Ali; Mahmoudirad, Mahnaz",Fibers Polym,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346784/,333

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY In September 2020, a nationwide cross-sectional survey study among Dutch intensive care nurses was carried out to measure prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and need for recovery (NFR), objectified by the HADS-A, HADS-D, IES-6 and NFR questionnaires, respectively. Associated risk factors were determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder were reported by 27.0%, 18.6% and 22.2% of the 726 respondents, respectively. The NFR was positive, meaning not being recovered from work, in 41.7%. Working in an academic hospital, being afraid of infecting relatives and experiencing insufficient numbers of colleagues were associated with more mental symptoms, while having been on holiday was associated with reduced depression symptoms and need for recovery. CONCLUSION The first COVID-19 surge had a high impact on the mental well-being of intensive care nurses, increasing the risk for drop out and jeopardising the continuity of care. Effort should be made to optimize working conditions and decrease workload to guarantee care in the next months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Heesakkers, Hidde; Zegers, Marieke; van Mol, Margo M C; van den Boogaard, Mark",Intensive & critical care nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2021.103034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863609/,333

60920,"Study protocol: In the preparation and administration of intravenous medicines, what are the best practice standards that healthcare professionals need to follow to ensure patient safety?",2020,"African swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease of domestic and wild pigs that is responsible for serious economic and production losses. It is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV), a large and complex icosahedral DNA virus of the Asfarviridae family. Currently, there is no effective treatment or approved vaccine against the ASFV. pS273R, a specific SUMO-1 cysteine protease, catalyzes the maturation of the pp220 and pp62 polyprotein precursors into core-shell proteins. Here, we present the crystal structure of the ASFV pS273R protease at a resolution of 2.3 angstroms. The overall structure of the pS273R protease is represented by two domains named the ""core domain"" and the N-terminal ""arm domain"". The ""arm domain"" contains the residues from M1 to N83, and the ""core domain"" contains the residues from N84 to A273. A structure analysis reveals that the ""core domain"" shares a high degree of structural similarity with chlamydial deubiquitinating enzyme, sentrin-specific protease, and adenovirus protease, while the ""arm domain"" is unique to ASFV. Further, experiments indicated that the ""arm domain"" plays an important role in maintaining the enzyme activity of ASFV pS273R. Moreover, based on the structural information of pS273R, we designed and synthesized several peptidomimetic aldehyde compounds at a submolar IC50 value, which paves the way for the design of inhibitors to target this severe pathogen.IMPORTANCEAfrican swine fever virus, a large and complex icosahedral DNA virus, causes a deadly infection in domestic pigs. In addition to Africa and Europe, countries in Asia, including China, Vietnam, and Mongolia, were negatively affected by the hazards posed by ASFV outbreaks in 2018-2019, at which time more than 30 million pigs were culled. Until now, there has been no vaccine for protection against ASFV infection or effective treatments to cure ASF. Here, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of the ASFV pS273R protease. The pS273R protease has a two-domain structure that distinguishes it from other members of the SUMO protease family, while the unique ""arm domain"" has been proven to be essential for its hydrolytic activity. Moreover, the peptidomimetic aldehyde compounds designed to target the substrate binding pocket exert prominent inhibitory effects and can thus be used in a potential lead for anti-ASFV drug development.","Li, Guobang; Liu, Xiaoxia; Yang, Mengyuan; Zhang, Guangshun; Wang, Zhengyang; Guo, Kun; Gao, Yuxue; Jiao, Peng; Sun, Jixue; Chen, Cheng; Wang, Hao; Deng, Weilong; Xiao, Huihe; Li, Sizheng; Wu, Haoru; Wang, Ying; Cao, Lin; Jia, Zihan; Shang, Luqing; Yang, Cheng; Guo, Yu; Rao, Zihe",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02125-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075933/,333

METHODS In a retrospective chart review, data were analyzed from 165 patients who underwent a TLH with an unidirectional barbed suture technique for vaginal cuff closure from January 2012 to June 2016 at tertiary-care university-based teaching hospital and academic affiliated hospital. Vaginal cuff was closed by single layer 3/0 V-Loc unidirectional 9″, 180 day Absorbable Wound Closure Device (Covidien Healthcare, Mansfield, MA) and the suture was not stitched backward to secure distal end. RESULTS A total of 165 patients were included and the median age was 50 years (range, 35-84 years). The median completion time for hysterectomy time was 100 min (range, 40-240 min) and the median vaginal cuff closure time was 7 min (range, 4-15 min). The median estimated blood loss was 87.8 mL (range 30-250 mL) and the median uterine weight was 200 g (range, 40-900 g). Intraoperative complication included bladder perforation (1.2%) and postoperative complications were vaginal cuff dehiscence (1.8%), cuff cellulitis (0.6%), vesicovaginal fistula (0.6%) and unexplained fever (0.6%).

62988,Patient-Reported Quality of Life 3 Months after Breast Reconstruction.,2021,"UNLABELLED WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Radiological imaging is heavily relied on for follow up after renal ablative therapy. We show that while this is largely reliable, there are quantifiable false negative and false positive findings. A non-involuting zone of ablation should be considered for multisite-directed core biopsies even in the absence of detectable enhancement. OBJECTIVE To evaluate our experience with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for renal masses and to report on clinical, radiological and post-RFA biopsy results. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study collected clinical, radiological and pathological data from 150 consecutive patients who were treated with RFA of a renal mass between 2002 and 2008 at a tertiary referral centre. Post-ablation biopsies were performed in patients with non-involuting lesions or suspicion of recurrence on imaging. Comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Renal malignancy was found in 72.1% of patients based on the initial diagnostic biopsy. Median tumour size was 2.6 cm, 22.7% of patients had a solitary kidney, and most were central tumours. The mean follow-up period was 40.1 month. There was no recurrence in 96.7% of the entire cohort. Cancer-specific survival for 106 patients with sporadic, localized, biopsy proven renal malignancy was 100% at 38.5 months. Biopsies were obtained in 43 patients for a median of 21 months after RFA. Among 38 patients who had biopsy for non-involuting, non-enhancing zones of ablation, three (7.9%) were positive. CONCLUSIONS Short-term cancer-specific survival after RFA remains excellent and most cases are successful based on a combination of imaging and post-ablation biopsies performed almost 2 years after treatment. There were four out of 150 (2.7%) patients who had recurrences with tissue confirmation; one of these patients was detected on imaging and three (2%) were radiologically occult. The absence of enhancement in the setting of non-involuting lesions is not always a guarantee of a successful ablation.","Karam, Jose A; Ahrar, Kamran; Vikram, Raghunandan; Romero, Claudio A; Jonasch, Eric; Tannir, Nizar M; Rao, Priya; Wood, Christopher G; Matin, Surena F",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2012.11608.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23510233/,333

Since the advent of COVID-19, speech-language pathologists must adapt in-clinic treatments for online presentation. This research aimed to gather information from speech-language pathologists on their experiences of telepractice to deliver the Lidcombe Program to treat stuttering in young children. METHODS This paper presents the findings of an online survey that polled the clinical experiences of 106 speech-language pathologists who were delivering the Lidcombe Program via telepractice during COVID-19. RESULTS The majority of respondents were experienced clinicians from the United States and Canada who had attended a Lidcombe Program workshop. Prior to COVID-19, 80 % had provided some clinical services online (up to 10 % of the time), and at the start of COVID-19 public lockdown orders, 77 % viewed telepractice as both a necessity and an opportunity. Three months after the public lockdown orders, the large majority, 94 %, said that they would continue to use both telepractice and in-clinic treatment in the future. Technology issues, concerns about establishing the clinical relationship, and identification of mild stuttering featured as challenges of telepractice service delivery, while benefits included time efficiency, flexibility of scheduling, and improved clinical processes. CONCLUSION Respondents reported that the Lidcombe Program was easily translatable to telepractice and the majority intend to continue telepractice in the future.","Santayana, Gissella; Carey, Brenda; Shenker, Rosalee C",Journal of fluency disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfludis.2021.105879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34624789/,333

A study of leaf morphology and anatomy, biomechanics of entire leaves and individual tissues and self-sealing kinematics after a ring incision under low and high relative humidity (RH) was carried out comparing the closely related species Delosperma cooperi and Delosperma ecklonis, which are indigenous to semi-arid highlands and regions with an oceanic climate, respectively. For both species, the absolute contractions of the examined leaf segments (""apex"", ""incision"", ""base"") were more pronounced at low RH levels. Independent of the given RH level, the absolute contractions within the incision region of D. cooperi were significantly higher than in all other segments of this species and of D. ecklonis. The more pronounced contraction of D. cooperi leaves was linked mainly to the elastic properties of the central vascular strand, which is approximately twice as flexible as that of D. ecklonis leaves.","Hesse, Linnea; Kampowski, Tim; Leupold, Jochen; Caliaro, Sandra; Speck, Thomas; Speck, Olga",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21165768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796721/,333

65768,Are decision aids for all? Time to take care of the millions of low literate.,2020-05-09,"Airflow is a critical factor that influences air quality, airborne contaminant distribution, and disease transmission in commercial airliner cabins. The general aircraft-cabin air-contaminant transport effect model seeks to build exposure-spatial relationships between contaminant sources and receptors, quantify the uncertainty, and provide a platform for incorporation of data from a variety of studies. Knowledge of infection risk to flight crews and passengers is needed to form a coherent response to an unfolding epidemic, and infection risk may have an airborne pathogen exposure component. The general aircraf-tcabin air-contaminant transport effect model was applied to datasets from the University of Illinois and Kansas State University and also to case study information from a flight with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission. Data were fit to regression curves, where the dependent variable was contaminant concentration (normalized for source strength and ventilation rate), and the independent variable was distance between source and measurement locations. The data-driven model showed exposure to viable small droplets and post-evaporation nuclei at a source distance of several rows in a mock-up of a twin-aisle airliner with seven seats per row. Similar behavior was observed in tracer gas, particle experiments, and flight infection data for severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study supports the airborne pathway as part of the matrix of possible disease transmission modes in aircraft cabins.","Bennett, James S; Jones, Byron W; Hosni, Mohammad H; Zhang, Yuanhui; Topmiller, Jennifer L; Dietrich, Watts L",HVAC&R research,https://doi.org/10.1080/10789669.2013.838990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26526769/,333
66121,[COVID-19 effect on mental health and sleep disorders].,2021,"PURPOSE The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of MSC exosomes with hyaluronic acid (HA) against HA alone for functional cartilage regeneration in a rabbit osteochondral defect model. METHODS Critical-size osteochondral defects (4.5-mm diameter and 1.5-mm depth) were created on the trochlear grooves in the knees of eighteen rabbits and were randomly allocated to two treatment groups: (1) Exosomes and HA combination and (2) HA alone. Three 1-ml injections of either exosomes and HA or HA alone were administered intra-articularly immediately after surgery and thereafter at 7 and 14 days after surgery. At 6 and 12 weeks, gross evaluation, histological and immunohistochemical analysis, and scorings were performed. The functional biomechanical competence of the repaired cartilage was also evaluated. RESULTS Compared to defects treated with HA, defects treated with exosomes and HA showed significant improvements in macroscopic scores (P=0.032; P=0.001) and histological scores (P=0.005; P<0.001) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Defects treated with exosomes and HA also demonstrated improvements in mechanical properties compared to HA-treated defects, with significantly higher Young's moduli (P<0.05) and stiffness (P<0.05) at 6 and 12 weeks. By 12 weeks, the newly-repaired tissues in defects treated with exosomes and HA composed mainly of hyaline cartilage that are mechanically and structurally superior to that of HA-treated defects and demonstrated mechanical properties that approximated that of adjacent native cartilage (P>0.05). In contrast, HA-treated defects showed some repair at 6 weeks, but this was not sustained, as evidenced by significant deterioration of histological scores (P=0.002) and a plateau in mechanical properties from 6 to 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that the combination of MSC exosomes and HA administered at a clinically acceptable frequency of three intra-articular injections can promote sustained and functional cartilage repair in a rabbit post-traumatic cartilage defect model, when compared to HA alone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Human MSC exosomes and HA administered in combination promote functional cartilage repair, and may represent a promising cell-free therapy for cartilage repair in patients.","Wong McI, Keng Lin; Zhang, Shipin; Wang, Ming; Ren, Xiafei; Hassan, Afizah; Lai, Ruenn Chai; Lim, Sai Kiang; Lee, Eng Hin; Po Hui, James Hoi; Toh, Wei Seong",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2020.03.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302651/,333

METHODS A total of 19 and 104 patients who respectively underwent LESS-A and CLA between May 1996 and June 2011 were included in the study. Questionnaires inquiring about scar pain (0: not painful, 10: very painful), satisfaction (0: not satisfied, 10: very satisfied) and cosmesis (0: very unsightly, 10: very beautiful) on the basis of a visual analogue scale were sent to patients postoperatively. RESULTS The respondents consisted of 11 and 54 patients who underwent LESS-A and CLA, respectively. There was no significant inter-group difference in age, sex, affected side or body mass index. No significant differences were observed in operative time or estimated blood loss. There were also no significant differences in pain (0.67 vs. 0.57, p = 0.393), satisfaction (8.92 vs. 8.46, p = 0.453), or cosmesis score (8.58 vs. 8.00, p = 0.487) between the LESS-A and CLA groups overall. In female patients, the satisfaction score was significantly higher in the LESS-A group than in the CLA group (10.0 vs. 8.72, p = 0.049). In young patients (<50 years old), the satisfaction score was also significantly higher in the LESS-A group than in the CLA group (9.17 vs. 6.38, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS Young patients and female patients who had received LESS-A adrenal surgery were more satisfied with the scar outcomes than were the young patients and female patients who had received CLA. We suggest that this patient subset most values the cosmetic benefits of LESS-A.","Inoue, Shogo; Ikeda, Kenichiro; Kobayashi, Kanao; Kajiwara, Mitsuru; Teishima, Jun; Matsubara, Akio",Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.1543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454596/,333

Children from racial/ethnic minority groups or who live in poverty experience elevated rates of obesity. One potential method for reducing childhood obesity disparities is to involve community health workers (frontline public health workers who are trusted members of and/or have an unusually close understanding of the community served). The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the role and effectiveness of community health workers in childhood obesity interventions. Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, of which nine were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Results demonstrated that community health workers played various roles in childhood obesity interventions in the home, clinic, school, and community setting. Interventions focused primarily on children from underserved populations. Meta-analytic findings demonstrated a small but significant impact on BMIz and BMI percentile (BMIz [7 studies]: -0.08, 95% CI: -0.15, -0.01, p = 0.03, I2 = 39.4%; BMI percentile [2 studies]: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.38, -0.11, p < 0.01, I2 = 0%).

66441,Primary care approach to Kawasaki disease.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Non-penetrating mesh fixation is becoming widely accepted even though little is known about the short-term fixation strength of these techniques. Although clinical outcomes are the ultimate measure of effectiveness, ex vivo biomechanical evaluation provides insights about the load-carrying capacity of the mesh-tissue complex in vivo. As such, the purpose of this study was to compare the short-term fixation strength of three unique non-penetrating methods of fixation: LifeMesh™, ProGrip™, and Tisseel™. Among these, LifeMesh™ is a novel technology where large-pore, mid-weight polypropylene mesh is embedded in a dry matrix of porcine gelatin and microbial transglutaminase enzyme, providing self-fixation without the need for a separate adhesive application. METHODS Seven mongrel swine underwent implantation of two 4 × 7 cm pieces of either LifeMesh™, ProGrip™, or polypropylene mesh fixated with 2 mL of Tisseel™; 10 min after application, the samples were excised with the abdominal wall and stored for immediate biomechanical testing. The samples underwent lap shear testing to determine the short-term fixation strength of these three technologies. RESULTS ProGrip™ demonstrated mean fixation strength of 1.3 N/cm (±STE 0.2). Mean fixation for mesh fixated with Tisseel™ was 2.6 N/cm (±STE 0.5). LifeMesh™ samples had mean fixation strength of 8.0 N/cm (±STE 2.1). Analysis of variance testing showed that interfacial strength of LifeMesh™ was significantly greater than that of either ProGrip™ or Tisseel™. ProGrip™ and Tisseel™ were not significantly different from each other (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS Short-term strength of mesh fixation is an undescribed factor in hernia repair, but could have significant implications for early recurrence and mesh contraction. While further investigation is needed to define adequate interfacial strength, this comparison of non-penetrating mesh fixation methods shows that the novel LifeMesh™ technology exhibits greater strength than other non-penetrating fixation techniques.","Shahan, Charles P; Stoikes, Nathaniel N; Roan, Esra; Tatum, James; Webb, David L; Voeller, Guy R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5119-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27444826/,333

66795,The value of physical examination in the era of telemedicine.,2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVES With the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinicians have used personal protective equipment to avoid transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However they still face occupational risk of infection, when treating COVID-19 patients. This may be highest during invasive diagnostic procedures releasing aerosols and droplets. Thereby the use of diagnostic procedures for Covid-19 associated aspergillosis may be delayed or impeded, as use of bronchoscopy has been discouraged. This leads to avoidance of a crucial procedure for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis. We intent to visualize aerosol and droplet spread and surface contamination during bronchoscopy and address which measures can avoid exposure of health care workers. METHODS We created a simulation model to visualize aerosol and droplet generation as well as surface contamination by nebulizing fluorescent solution detected by using ultraviolet light and slow motion capture. We repurposed covers for ultrasound transducers or endoscopic cameras to prevent surface and ambient air contamination. RESULTS In our bronchoscopy simulation model, we noticed extensive aerosol generation, droplet spread and surface contamination. Exposure of health-care workers and contamination of surfaces can be efficiently reduced by repurposing covers for ultrasound transducers or endoscopic cameras to seal the tube opening during bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated patients. CONCLUSION Adequate personal protective equipment and safety strategies allow to minimize contamination during bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.","Koehler, Philipp; Cornely, Oliver A; Kochanek, Matthias",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918497/,333
67013,Predatory journals.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The relationship between dense packing and incidence of angiographic recurrence after endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms has been shown but remains controversial. We retrospectively analyzed intracranial aneurysms treated with detachable coils to determine the relation between aneurysm volume, packing, and recurrence. METHODS We reviewed 221 aneurysms in 199 patients who underwent endovascular coiling using detachable coils from November 2009 to December 2011. Aneurysm volumes were determined using three-dimensional images obtained from rotational angiography. Aneurysm packing was defined as the ratio between the volume of coils inserted and the volume of aneurysm. At follow-up, angiographic results were dichotomized into presence or absence of recurrence. The relationship between aneurysm volume to fill, packing, and angiographic recurrence was determined by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Follow-up angiography (mean follow-up 8.8 months) revealed recurrence in 14.5% of the aneurysms studied in our series. Recurrent aneurysms had a mean packing of 15.1% while stable aneurysms (non-recurrent) had a mean packing of 23.7%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that aneurysm volume and packing were significantly associated with angiographic recurrence. Large volume aneurysms (>600 mm(3)) were found to have a higher incidence of recurrence than those with small volumes (OR=30.49, p<0.001). Compared with those with high packing (≥20%), the less packed aneurysms (<20%) had a higher incidence of recurrence (OR=29.01, p=0.002). There was no significant difference between aneurysm location, clinical presentation, stent assistance, duration of follow-up, and recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Coiling large volume (>600 mm(3)) intracranial aneurysms are more likely to have a recurrence than small ones. High packing (≥20%) provides better protection against recurrence of the aneurysm.","Leng, Bing; Zheng, Yongtao; Ren, Jinma; Xu, Qiang; Tian, Yanlong; Xu, Feng",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107598/,333

Identifying risk factors may promote its prevention and management. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the incidence of agitation and hyperactive delirium in postcardiotomy patients during the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and to identify the risk factors for its development. METHODS This single center, retrospective study was conducted at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University. Data were extracted from the prospective institutional registry database of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict risk factors. RESULTS A total of 170 consecutive adult patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Ninety-four patients were included in the final analysis. The incidence of agitation and hyperactive delirium was 35% in our population of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported postcardiotomy patients. Agitation and delirium usually occurred within the first 3 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Multivariable analysis showed that history of previous stroke (without preoperative cognitive dysfunction; odds ratio, 4.425, 95% confidence interval: 1.171-16.716; p = 0.028) and mean arterial pressure reduction (before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation) ⩾ 49 mmHg (odds ratio, 7.570, 95% confidence interval: 2.366-24.219, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for agitation and hyperactive delirium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of agitation and hyperactive delirium was 0.704 (95% confidence interval 0.589-0.820, p = 0.001). There was more severe arrhythmia in the agitation patients. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that the prevalence of agitation and hyperactive delirium in postcardiotomy patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support is high. In addition, previous stroke and severe mean arterial pressure reduction before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation is predictive of agitation and hyperactive delirium.","Wang, Hong; Hou, Dengbang; Tian, Xiaqiu; Wang, Liangshan; Li, Chenglong; Jia, Ming; Hou, Xiaotong",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659120937549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32627668/,333

DESIGN An adapted version of Boelen's health partnership model was used to identify each community's Health Care Partners: health providers, academics, policy makers, health managers, community representatives and linked sectors. Qualitative data were gathered using a semistructured interview guide. Major themes were identified through content analysis, and this information was fed back to government and interviewees in reports every 6 months. SETTING The 107 communities visited thus far have healthcare services that range from hospitals with surgical programs to remote communities with no medical services at all. The majority have access to local primary care. PARTICIPANTS Participants were recruited from the Health Care Partner groups identified above using purposeful and snowball sampling. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES A successful process was developed to engage rural communities in identifying their healthcare priorities, while simultaneously building and strengthening relationships. The qualitative data were analysed from 185 meetings in 80 communities and shared with policy makers at governmental and community levels. RESULTS 36 themes have been identified and three overarching themes that interconnect all the interviews, namely Relationships, Autonomy and Change Over Time, are discussed. CONCLUSION The SV Project appears to be unique in that it is physician led, prioritises relationships, engages all of the healthcare partners singly and jointly in each community, is ongoing, provides feedback to both the policy makers and all interviewees on a 6-monthly basis and, by virtue of its large scope, has the ability to produce interim reports that have helped inform system change.","Johnston, Campbell Stuart; Belanger, Erika; Wong, Krystal; Snadden, David",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649845/,333

Although telepsychotherapy is new to many clinical psychologists, there is considerable research on telepsychotherapy treatments. Nearly 2 decades of clinical research on telepsychotherapy treatments with children with neurological conditions has the potential to inform emerging clinical practice in the age of COVID-19. Toward that end, we synthesized findings from 14 clinical trials of telepsychotherapy problem-solving and parent-training interventions involving more than 800 children and families with diverse diagnoses, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, brain tumors, congenital heart disease, and perinatal stroke. We summarize efficacy across studies and clinical populations and report feasibility and acceptability data from the perspectives of parents, children, and psychotherapists. We describe adaptation for international contexts and strategies for troubleshooting technological challenges and working with families of varying socioeconomic strata. The extensive research literature reviewed and synthesized provides considerable support for the utility of telepsychotherapy with children with neurological conditions and their families and underscores its high level of acceptability with both diverse clinical populations and providers. During this period of heightened vulnerability and stress and reduced access to usual supports and services, telepsychotherapy approaches such as online family problem-solving treatment and online parenting skills training may allow psychologists to deliver traditional evidence-based treatments virtually while preserving fidelity and efficacy.","Wade, Shari L; Gies, Lisa M; Fisher, Allison P; Moscato, Emily L; Adlam, Anna R; Bardoni, Alessandra; Corti, Claudia; Limond, Jennifer; Modi, Avani C; Williams, Tricia",Journal of psychotherapy integration,https://doi.org/10.1037/int0000215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295136/,333

70111,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A View from New York City.,2020-07-14,"OBJECTIVE Older patients presenting with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) require holistic assessment. We carried out a longitudinal cohort study to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of older, frail adults with NSTEACS undergoing coronary angiography. METHODS 217 consecutive patients aged ≥65 years (mean age 80.9±4.0 years, 60.8% male) with NSTEACS referred for coronary angiography were recruited from two tertiary cardiac centres between November 2012 and December 2015. Frailty was assessed with the Fried Frailty Index; a score of 0 was characterised as robust, 1-2 prefrail and ≥3 frail. The Short Form Survey 36 (SF-36), an HRQoL tool consisting of eight domains spanning physical and mental health, was performed at baseline and 1 year. RESULTS 186 patients (85.7%) had invasive revascularisation. At baseline, 52 (23.9%) patients were frail and 121 (55.8%) were prefrail, with most SF-36 domains falling below the norm-population mean. Patients with frailty had lower mean scores in all physical SF-36 domains (p≤0.05) compared with those without frailty. Robust patients had temporal improvement in two domains (role physical +5.80 (95% CI 1.31 to 10.3) and role emotional +6.46 (95% CI 1.02 to 11.9)) versus patients with frailty and prefrailty, who had a collective improvement in a greater number of physical and psychological domains at 1 year (2 domains vs 11 domains), notably role physical (prefrail +6.53 (95% CI 3.85 to 9.20) and frail +10.4 (95% CI 6.7814.1)). CONCLUSIONS Frail older adults with NSTEACS have poor HRQoL. One year following invasive management, there are modest improvements in HRQoL, most marked in frail and prefrail patients, who received a proportionally larger benefit than robust patients.

The inspiratory/expiratory tidal volume per kilogram of body weight in the Ambu group was significantly different from those in the other groups (P < 0.05), while the leak pressure in the Ambu group was significantly lower (P < 0.05). At T3 and T4, the expiratory resistance values in the Ambu group were significantly lower than those in the LMA-S group (P < 0.05). We have shown that the three laryngeal masks provided secure ventilation in children <6 years of age by using continuous respiratory dynamic monitoring. We concluded that the I-gel presented a better sealing effect and fewer adverse reactions.","Gu, Zhiqing; Jin, Quanying; Liu, Junjun; Chen, Lianhua",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-016-9917-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27492428/,333

73032,Parental experiences and perspectives on the value of seizure detection while caring for a child with epilepsy: A qualitative study.,2021-09-28,"Introduction: Vaccines and drugs for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 require robust evidence generated from clinical trials before they can be used. Decisions on how to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing and travel restrictions should also be based on evidence. There are some experiential and mathematical modelling data for these interventions, but there is a lack of data on the social, ethical and behavioural aspects of these interventions in the literature. Therefore, our study aims to produce evidence to inform (non-pharmaceutical) interventions such as communications, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, travel restrictions and other public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study will be conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia and Thailand. We propose to conduct 600-1000 quantitative surveys and 25-35 qualitative interviews per country. Data collection will follow the following four themes: (1) Quarantine and self-isolation (2) social distancing and travel restrictions (3) wellbeing and mental health (4) information, misinformation and rumours. In light of limitations of travel and holding in-person meetings, we will use online/remote methods for collecting data. Study participant will be adults who have provided informed consent from different demographic, socio-economic and risk groups. Discussion: At the time of writing, United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia and Thailand have initiated strict public health measures and varying degrees of ""lockdowns"" to curb the pandemic. It is anticipated that these public health measures will continue in some countries (e.g. Italy, Malaysia) or be tightened further in other countries (e.g. Thailand, UK) to control the spread of the disease in the coming weeks and months. The data generated from our study could inform these strategies in real time.","Pan-Ngum, Wirichada; Poomchaichote, Tassawan; Cuman, Giulia; Cheah, Phee-Kheng; Waithira, Naomi; Mukaka, Mavuto; Naemiratch, Bhensri; Kulpijit, Natinee; Chanviriyavuth, Rita; Asarath, Supa-At; Ruangkajorn, Supanat; Silan, Margherita; Stoppa, Silvia; Zuanna, Gianpiero Della; Ongkili, Darlene; Cheah, Phaik Kin; Osterrieder, Anne; Schneiders, Mira; Mackworth-Young, Constance R S; Cheah, Phaik Yeong",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15813.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32704548/,333

Despite advances in biotechnology that have improved diagnosis and treatment of such diseases, delays in detecting outbreaks and the lack of countermeasures for some biological agents continue to pose severe challenges to global health security. In this review, we describe some of the challenges facing global health security and how genome editing technologies can help overcome them. We provide specific examples of how the genome-editing tool CRISPR is being used to develop new tools to characterize pathogenic agents, diagnose infectious disease, and develop vaccines and therapeutics to mitigate the effects of an outbreak. The article also discusses some of the challenges associated with genome-editing technologies and the efforts that scientists are undertaking to mitigate them.

Since cellular dormancy is one strategy for surviving, and since chemokines determine the environmental conditions in which dormancy occurs, we investigated how chemokines affect temozolomide (TMZ)-promoted cellular dormancy entry and exit in GBM cells. TMZ administration over ten days promoted cellular dormancy entry, whereas discontinuing TMZ for a further 15 days resulted in resumption of proliferation. Co-administration of a chemokine cocktail containing CXCL12, CXCL16, and CX3CL1 resulted in both delayed entry and exit from cellular dormancy. A microarray-based transcriptome analysis in LN229 GBM cells revealed that cellular dormancy entry was characterized by an increased expression of CCL2 and SAA2, while THSD4, FSTL3, and VEGFC were upregulated during dormancy exit. Co-stimulation with the chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes. After verifying the appearance of identified genes in human GBM primary cultures and ex vivo samples, we clarified whether each chemokine alone impacts cellular dormancy mechanisms using specific antagonists and selective CRISPR/Cas9 clones. While expression of CCL2 and SAA2 in LN229 cells was altered by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CXCR7 axis, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 contributed to reduced upregulation of THSD4 and, to a weaker extent, of VEGFC. The influence on FSTL3 expression depended on the entire chemokine cocktail. Effects of chemokines on dormancy entry and exit-associated genes were detectable in human GBM primary cells, too, even if in a more complex, cell-specific manner. Thus, chemokines play a significant role in the regulation of TMZ-promoted cellular dormancy in GBMs.","Adamski, Vivian; Hattermann, Kirsten; Kubelt, Carolin; Cohrs, Gesa; Lucius, Ralph; Synowitz, Michael; Sebens, Susanne; Held-Feindt, Janka",Oncogene,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-020-1302-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346064/,333

However, it requires a high energy input and does not promote energy recovery. Currently, high-rate activated sludge (HRAS) process is gaining importance as a good option to reduce the energy demand of wastewater treatment and to capture organic matter for valorizing through anaerobic digestion (AD). Besides, food waste addition to wastewater can help to increase the organic matter content of wastewater and thus, energy recovery in AD. The objective of this study is to evaluate the applicability of co-treatment of municipal wastewater and food waste in a pilot-scale HRAS system as well as to test the minimal hydraulic retention times (HRTs) such as 60 and 30 min. Food waste addition to the wastewater resulted in a 10% increase in chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of influent. In the following stages of the study, the pilot-scale system was operated with wastewater solely under the HRTs of 60 and 30 min. With the decrease of HRT, particulate COD removal increased; however, soluble COD removal decreased. The results demonstrated that if the settling process is optimized, more particulate matter can be diverted to sludge stream.","Guven, Huseyin; Ozgun, Hale; Ersahin, Mustafa Evren; Dereli, Recep Kaan; Sinop, Ilknur; Ozturk, Izzet",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3665-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30456611/,333

METHODS For this case-control matched study, consecutive patients aged 18-90 years and admitted to nine nationwide hospitals with acute ischemic stroke between December 2008 and June 2010, were enrolled as cases. Controls, individually matched by age and sex, were chosen from the 4th Korean National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (2008-2010). Based on odds ratios and prevalence, standardized according to the age and sex structure of the Korean population, PARs of major risk factors were estimated according to age (young, ≤ 45; middle-aged, 46-65; and elderly, ≥ 66 years) and sex subgroups. RESULTS In 4,743 matched case-control sets, smoking (PAR, 45.1%) was the greatest contributing risk factor in young men, followed by hypertension (28.5%). In middle-aged men, the greatest contributing factors were smoking (37.4%), hypertension (22.7%), and diabetes (14.6%), whereas in women the greatest factors were hypertension (22.7%) and stroke history (10.6%). In the elderly, hypertension was the leading factor in men (23.7%) and women (23.4%). Other noticeable factors were stroke history (men, 19.7%; women, 17.3%) and diabetes (men, 12.5%; women, 15.1%). In young women, risk factors with a PAR greater than 10% were not found. CONCLUSIONS Smoking cessation in young people and hypertension and diabetes control in older people may be effective in reducing the burden of stroke on the population. In the elderly, secondary prevention could also be emphasized.","Park, Tai Hwan; Ko, Youngchai; Lee, Soo Joo; Lee, Kyung Bok; Lee, Jun; Han, Moon-Ku; Park, Jong-Moo; Cho, Yong-Jin; Hong, Keun-Sik; Kim, Dae-Hyun; Cha, Jae-Kwan; Oh, Mi-Sun; Yu, Kyung-Ho; Lee, Byung-Chul; Yoon, Byung-Woo; Lee, Ji Sung; Lee, Juneyoung; Bae, Hee-Joon",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.17.3.302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26437995/,333

The World Health Organization recently released revised International Health Regulations (IHR) that serve as global legislation and provide guidelines for surveillance systems. The IHR aim to identify and prevent spread of these infectious diseases; however, there are some practical challenges that limit the usability of these regulations. IHR requires Member States to build necessary infrastructure for global surveillance, which may not be possible in underdeveloped countries. A large degree of freedom is given to each individual government and therefore different levels of reporting are common, with substantial emphasis on passive reporting. The IHR need to be enforceable and enforced without impinging on government autonomy or human rights. Unstable governments and developing countries require increased assistance in setting up and maintaining surveillance systems. This article addresses some challenges and potential solutions to the ability of national governments to adhere to the global health surveillance requirements detailed in the IHR.

77469,COVID-19: Is there a silver lining?,2020-05-01,"Interventional treatment regimens have increased the demand for accurate understanding of the progression of injury in acute ischemic stroke. However, conventional animal models severely inhibit collateral blood flow and mimic the malignant infarction profile not suitable for treatment. The aim of this study was to provide a clinically relevant profile of the emergence and course of ischemic injury in cases suitable for acute intervention, and was achieved by employing a M2 occlusion model (M2CAO) that more accurately simulates middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in humans. Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to Short (90 min), Intermediate (180 min) or Extended (600 min) transient M2CAO and examined longitudinally with interleaved diffusion-, T2- and arterial spin labeling perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging before and after reperfusion. We identified a rapid emergence of cytotoxic edema within tissue regions undergoing infarction, progressing in several distinct phases in the form of subsequent moderation and then reversal at 230 min (p < 0.0001). We identified also the early emergence of vasogenic edema, which increased consistently before and after reperfusion (p < 0.0001). The perfusion of the penumbra correlated more strongly to the perfusion of adjacent tissue regions than did the perfusion of regions undergoing infarction (p = 0.0088). This was interpreted as an effect of preserved collateral blood flow during M2CAO. Accordingly, we observed only limited recruitment of penumbra regions to the infarction core. However, a gradual increase in infarction size was still occurring as late as 10 hours after M2CAO. Our results indicate that patients suffering MCA branch occlusion stand to benefit from interventional therapy for an extended time period after the emergence of ischemic injury.","Little, Philip; Kvist, Ola; Grankvist, Rikard; Jonsson, Stefan; Damberg, Peter; Söderman, Michael; Arnberg, Fabian; Holmin, Staffan",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28068417/,333

The aim of this study was to establish animal model of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), and determine whether ethyl pyruvate (EP) attenuate inflammatory response of sinonasal mucosa by inhibiting HMGB1 in ARS animals. Thirty-six Sprague Dawley (SD) rat were used as follows: six normal controls without intervention (group 1); thirty rats were used for establishment of ARS rats model by nasal insertion of Merocel sponge, and model rats without any treatments (group 2), treated with nasal drops of sterile saline (group 3), 10 μl EP (group 4), and 20 μl EP (group 5), twice a day for 5 days, respectively. Bacterial culture was done regularly and the main bacterial strains were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. HMGB1 expression in sinonasal mucosa was detected by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Serum levels of HMGB1, IL-6, and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Data from 29 of 36 rats that had completed research were analyzed. Bacterial colony formation unit (CFU) of nasal secretion was significantly higher in each group of ARS rats compared with controls (p < 0.001). ARS rats treated with EP had only slightly decreased CFU, but significantly attenuated inflammatory response of sinonasal mucosa and decreased HMGB1 expression compared to those treated with saline alone (p < 0.001). Serum levels of HMGB1, IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly higher in ARS rats compared to controls, and decreased by EP treatments (p < 0.001). Nasal sponge packing led to acute inflammatory response of nasal sinus in rats, and increased the expression of HMGB1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Nasal drops with EP could attenuate the inflammation of sinonasal mucosa through inhibiting the expression of HMGB1, IL-6 and TNF-α in ARS rats.","Liang, Xiang; Shen, Yang; Zhang, Xiaowei; He, Guangxiang; Tan, Guolin",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85785-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737667/,333

77872,Chronic posterior sternoclavicular dislocation.,2012,"BACKGROUND An established body of literature has shown evidence of implicit bias in the health care system on the basis of patient race and ethnicity that contributes to well documented disparities in outcomes. However, little is known about the influence of patient race and ethnicity on the decision to order diagnostic radiology exams in the acute care setting. This study examines the role of patient race and ethnicity on the likelihood of diagnostic imaging exams being ordered during United States emergency department encounters. METHODS Publicly available data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department sample for the years 2006-2016 was compiled. The proportion of patient encounters where diagnostic imaging was ordered was tabulated by race/ethnicity, sub-divided by imaging modality. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the influence of patient race/ethnicity on the ordering of diagnostic imaging controlling for other patient and hospital characteristics. Survey weighting variables were used to formulate national-level estimates. RESULTS Using the weighted data, an average of 131,558,553 patient encounters were included each year for the 11-year study period. Imaging was used at 46% of all visits although this varied significantly by patient race and ethnicity with white patients receiving medical imaging at 49% of visits and non-white patients at 41% of visits (p < 0.001). This effect persisted in the controlled regression model and across all imaging modalities with the exception of ultrasound. Other factors with a significant influence on imaging use included patient age, gender, insurance status, number of co-morbidities, hospital setting (urban vs non-urban) and hospital region. There was no evidence to suggest that the disparate use of imaging by patient race and ethnicity changed over the 11-year study time period. CONCLUSION The likelihood that a diagnostic imaging exam will be ordered during United States emergency department encounters differs significantly by patient race and ethnicity even when controlling for other patient and hospital characteristics. Further work must be done to understand and mitigate what may represent systematic bias and ensure equitable use of health care resources.","Ross, Andrew B; Kalia, Vivek; Chan, Brian Y; Li, Geng",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05698-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894129/,333

DESIGN Randomised controlled trial. SETTING Eight teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. POPULATION One hundred women scheduled to undergo vaginal hysterectomy for benign conditions excluding pelvic organ prolapse. METHODS Women were randomised to vessel sealing or conventional surgery. The quality of life related to pelvic floor function was assessed using validated questionnaires before surgery and 6 months after surgery. Pain scores and recovery were assessed using a diary, including daily visual analogue scale scores, starting from the day before surgery until 6 weeks after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Visual analogue scale pain scores, surgery time, blood loss, complications, quality of life related to pelvic floor function and costs. RESULTS The evening after surgery, women in the vessel-sealing group reported significantly less pain (5.7 versus 4.5 on a scale of 0-10, P = 0.03), but after that pain scores were similar. Operation duration was shorter for vessel sealing (60 versus 71 minutes, P = 0.05). Blood loss and hospital stay did not differ. We observed no major difference in costs between the two interventions (2903 versus 3102 €, P = 0.26). Changes in micturition and defecation symptoms were not affected by the surgical technique used. CONCLUSION Using vessel sealing during vaginal hysterectomy resulted in less pain on the first postoperative day, shorter operating time, similar morbidity and similar pelvic floor function. No major differences in costs were found between the two interventions.","Lakeman, M M E; The, S; Schellart, R P; Dietz, V; ter Haar, J F; Thurkow, A; Scholten, P C; Dijkgraaf, M G W; Roovers, J P W R",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2012.03484.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22925365/,333

We aimed to investigate the time course and clinical relevance of ND after EVT. Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT for large arterial occlusions of the anterior cerebral circulation were enrolled. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were assessed before EVT, at the end of EVT, at 24 h (d1), on day 3 (d3), on day 15 (d15), at discharge and anytime when ND was indicated. ND was defined as an increase of ≥ 4 points in the NIHSS score and was divided into acute ND (AD, within 24 h), subacute ND (SD, d1-d3), and delayed ND (DD, d3-d15 or discharge). Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we explored predictors and outcomes of ND at different time periods. As a result, of 343 patients, 129 (37.6%) experienced ND, including 90 (26.2%) with AD, 27 (7.9%) with SD and 12 (3.5%) with DD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that history of hypertension, cardioembolic stroke, lower Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS), and poor collaterals were significantly associated with an increased risk of AD; history of hypertension, lower ASPECTS, poor collaterals, and unsuccessful recanalization, with SD; and high admission NIHSS score, with DD. In addition, patients who experienced AD (OR = 10.22, P < 0.001), SD (OR = 15.89, P = 0.004), or DD (OR = 8.31, P = 0.015) were more likely to have poor outcomes. ND was a strong predictor of poor stroke outcomes.

METHODS Combined lysis of thrombus with ultrasound and systemic tissue-plasminogen-activator for emergent revascularization in acute ischemic stroke is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will enroll subjects with the following main inclusion criteria: less than 4·5 hours from symptom onset (three-hours in US and Canada), age 18-80 years, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥ 10, and premorbid modified-Rankin-score of 0-1, eligibility for full dose recombinant tissue-plasminogen-activator. Subjects will receive two-hours of 2-MHz pulsed wave transcranial ultrasound (target group) or sham ultrasound (control group). The projected sample size is approximately 824 subjects. RESULTS The primary endpoint, based on intention-to-treat criteria of patients enrolled within three-hours of symptom onset is the comparison between target and control groups of modified-Rankin-score scores at day 90 poststroke assessed using the proportional odds method. The study will have two planned interim analyses after approximately one-third and two-thirds of subjects have reached the 90-day modified-Rankin-score evaluation. Safety outcomes are symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 h and an overall analysis of adverse events.

79760,"Reliability and Validity of Commercially Available Wearable Devices for Measuring Steps, Energy Expenditure, and Heart Rate: Systematic Review.",2020-09-08,"UNLABELLED A common feature of infection by positive-sense RNA virus is the modification of host cell cytoplasmic membranes that serve as sites of viral RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), but the role of DMVs in replication and virus fitness remains unclear. Coronaviruses encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), three of which, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are necessary and sufficient for DMV formation. It has been shown previously that mutations in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 loop 1 that alter nsp4 glycosylation are associated with disrupted DMV formation and result in changes in virus replication and RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether DMV morphology or another function of nsp4 glycosylation is responsible for effects on virus replication. In this study, we tested whether mutations across nsp4, both alone and in combination with mutations that abolish nsp4 glycosylation, affected DMV formation, replication, and fitness. Residues in nsp4 distinct from glycosylation sites, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal loop 1, independently disrupted both the number and morphology of DMVs and exacerbated DMV changes associated with loss of glycosylation. Mutations that altered DMV morphology but not glycosylation did not affect virus fitness while viruses lacking nsp4 glycosylation exhibited a loss in fitness. The results support the hypothesis that DMV morphology and numbers are not key determinants of virus fitness. The results also suggest that nsp4 glycosylation serves roles in replication in addition to the organization and stability of MHV-induced double-membrane vesicles. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense RNA viruses modify host cytoplasmic membranes for viral replication complex formation. Thus, defining the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane modifications is essential for both understanding virus replication and development of novel approaches to virus inhibition. Coronavirus-induced membrane changes include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes. Three viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are known to be required for DMV formation. It is unknown how these proteins induce membrane modification or which regions of the proteins are involved in DMV formation and stability. In this study, we show that mutations across nsp4 delay virus replication and disrupt DMV formation and that loss of nsp4 glycosylation is associated with a substantial fitness cost. These results support a critical role for nsp4 in DMV formation and virus fitness.","Beachboard, Dia C; Anderson-Daniels, Jordan M; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02776-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25473044/,333

Notably, 63% patients with an orthopedic disease noticed substantial symptom change before the MM diagnosis was made. The median TTD was 7 months and did not differ significantly between patients with or without a preexisting skeletal disease. To avoid delayed diagnosis, physicians should consider MM as a differential diagnosis, whenever warning signs such as skeletal pain independent from movement, at night, at various localizations, and change in pain characteristics accompanied by fatigue, are reported.","Herget, Georg W; Kälberer, Felix; Ihorst, Gabriele; Graziani, Giulia; Klein, Lukas; Rassner, Michael; Gehler, Christian; Jung, Johannes; Schmal, Hagen; Wäsch, Ralph; Engelhardt, Monika",Leukemia & lymphoma,https://doi.org/10.1080/10428194.2020.1849681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225781/,333

METHODS Theoretical-reflection study. RESULTS At the first moment named ""The global and the local in facing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"" is presented the health crisis that took place worldwide and the government actions to combat COVID-19. A second moment named ""Between dismantling actions and resistance, the UHS is the best way to face the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"", reflects on the neoliberal attacks on the health system and how it resists, remaining the main pandemic response strategy. CONCLUSION The strengthening of democracy and the defense of the UHS are the way out of the crisis. It is believed that this reflection generates - in everyone who deals with caretaking - the political action, the ethical attitude, the desire for valorization and the spirit of struggle in defense of the UHS and human life.","Araújo, Janieiry Lima de; Oliveira, Kalyane Kelly Duarte de; Freitas, Rodrigo Jácob Moreira de",Revista brasileira de enfermagem,https://doi.org/10.1590/0034-7167-2020-0247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667577/,333
80126,Wide variability in colorectal cancer screening uptake by general practitioner: Cross-sectional study.,2021-08-09,"Viral respiratory tract infections (VRTI) remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants and young children. In mice, optimal protection to VRTI is mediated by recruitment of effector T cells to the lungs and respiratory tract, and subsequent establishment of tissue resident memory T cells (Trm), which provide long-term protection. These critical processes of T cell recruitment to the respiratory tract, their role in disease pathogenesis, and establishment of local protective immunity remain undefined in pediatric VRTI. In this study, we investigated T cell responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) of infants and young children with VRTI, revealing developmental regulation of T cell differentiation and Trm generation in situ. We show a direct concurrence between T cell responses in the URT and LRT, including a preponderance of effector CD8+ T cells that was associated with disease severity. During infant VRTI, there was an accumulation of terminally differentiated effector cells (effector memory RA+ T cells) in the URT and LRT with reduced Trm in the early neonatal period, and decreased effector memory RA+ T cell and increased Trm formation with age during the early years of childhood. Moreover, human infant T cells exhibit increased expression of the transcription factor T-bet compared with adult T cells, suggesting a mechanism for preferential generation of effector over Trm. The developmental regulation of respiratory T cell responses as revealed in the present study is important for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating VRTI in the critical early life stages.","Connors, Thomas J; Baird, J Scott; Yopes, Margot C; Zens, Kyra D; Pethe, Kalpana; Ravindranath, Thyyar M; Ho, Siu-Hong; Farber, Donna L",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29848753/,333
80188,Gut microbiota: An intermediary between metabolic syndrome and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.,2020-09-08,"Today, persistent and uncontrolled inflammation is appreciated to play a pivotal role in many diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome and many other diseases of public health concern (e.g. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and periodontal disease). The ideal response to initial challenge in humans is a self-limited inflammatory response leading to complete resolution. The resolution phase is now widely recognized as a biosynthetically active process, governed by a superfamily of endogenous chemical mediators that stimulate resolution of inflammatory responses, namely specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). Because resolution is the natural ideal response, the SPMs have gained attention. SPMs are mediators that include ω-6 arachidonic acid-derived lipoxins, ω-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived resolvins, protectins and maresins, cysteinyl-SPMs, as well as n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)-derived SPMs. These novel immunoresolvents, their biosynthetic pathways and receptors have proven to promote resolution of inflammation, clearance of microbes, reduce pain and promote tissue regeneration via specific cellular and molecular mechanisms. As of 17 August, 2020, PubMed.gov reported >1170 publications for resolvins, confirming their potent protective actions from many laboratories worldwide. Since this field is rapidly expanding, we provide a short update of advances within 2-3 years from human and preclinical animal studies, together with the structural-functional elucidation of SPMs and identification of novel SPM receptors. These new discoveries indicate that SPMs, their pathways and receptors could provide a basis for new approaches for treating inflammation-associated diseases and for stimulating tissue regeneration via resolution pharmacology and precision nutrition.","Chiang, Nan; Serhan, Charles N",Essays in biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1042/ebc20200018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885825/,333
80218,Changes of hemodynamic and cerebral oxygenation after exercise in normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia: associations with acute mountain sickness.,2018,"BACKGROUND Paediatric arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) is an important cause of acute neurological symptoms in children, it causes significant morbidity and is one of the top ten causes of childhood deaths. Consensus papers have suggested guidelines for the management of AIS in childhood, although none recommend thrombectomy. Despite this, children within our institution have undergone mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion. This is the first series of mechanical thrombectomy and outcomes performed in children in the U.K. METHODS We describe the endovascular management of paediatric arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) in four children (5-15 years) with PedNIHSS > 17. RESULTS Three had basilar artery (BA) occlusion and one left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. All underwent uncomplicated thrombectomy followed by intravenous heparin. One had a successful second attempt. The BA cases underwent thrombectomy 17-36 h after symptom onset; the left MCA case <6 h after symptom onset. Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) was 0-3, 50% had MRS 0. DISCUSSION Adult AIS guidelines recommend IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) within 4.5 h of onset and intra-arterial r-tPA within 6 h; thrombectomy being reserved for carefully selected patients. Paediatric AIS recognition is problematic, often with delayed imaging. There is little evidence regarding efficacy of thrombectomy for paediatric AIS. Our experience suggests there may be a role for endovascular clot retrieval in selected patients managed by an experienced multidisciplinary team. Careful data collection is mandatory.","Bodey, Caroline; Goddard, Tony; Patankar, Tufail; Childs, Anne Marie; Ferrie, Colin; McCullagh, Helen; Pysden, Karen",European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpn.2014.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25135471/,333

HEIs are environments at high risk of COVID-19 diffusion, due to the high number of people sharing the same environment, and complex to protect, because of the multiple functions present (e.g. teaching rooms, research facilities, dormitories). Protection of HEIs is therefore a serious, but apparently neglect, public health issue. Italy was the first country to be heavily hit in Europe by COVID-19. Italian HEIs had to quickly respond to the emergency with multifaceted interventions to protect all the people on campus while guaranteeing the continuity of research and teaching activities.

We hypothesized that the venous arterial carbon dioxide gap (P(v-a)CO2 gap); the ratio of this gap to arterio-venous oxygen content (P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio) and the anion gap would be early indicators of microcirculatory status and useful parameters for outcome prediction during ECMO support. We retrospectively reviewed 31 cardiogenic shock patients requiring veno-arterial ECMO, calculating P(v-a)CO2 gap and P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratios in the first 36 hours and the final 24 hours of ECMO support. Sixteen patients (52%) survived and 15 (48%) died. After 24 hours of ECMO support, the P(v-a)CO2 gap (4.9 ± 1.5 vs. 6.8 ± 1.9 mm Hg; p = 0.004) and anion gap (5.2 ± 1.8 vs. 8.7 ± 2.7 mmol/L; p < 0.001) were significantly higher in non-survivors. In the final 24 hours of ECMO support, the P(v-a)CO2 gap (3.5 ± 1.6 vs. 10.5 ± 3.2 mm Hg; p < 0.001), P(v-a)CO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio (1.1 ± 0.5 vs. 2.7 ± 1.0; p < 0.001), anion gap (5.1 ± 3.0 vs. 9.3 ± 5.9 mmol/L; p = 0.02), and lactate (median 1.0 [interquartile range {IQR}: 0.7-1.5] vs. 2.8 [IQR: 1.7-7.7] mmol/L; p = <0.001) were all significantly lower in survivors. Increasing P(v-a)CO2 gap and increasing anion gap were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality.

82579,Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery - A Systematic Review of the Current Literature.,2021,"High mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mt-OXPHOS) levels are required to supply the ATP necessary for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced granulosa cell proliferation during the follicular development process. Consequently, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) might be generated and have an adverse effect on follicular health. This study aimed to elucidate the negative effects of ROS on mitochondrial functions in FSH-stimulated granulosa cells during the follicular development process and to investigate whether pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) treatment could accelerate this process by ameliorating the adverse effects. To do this, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed with granulosa cells from superovulated immature (3-week-old) mice that were pretreated with or without PQQ, and a natural mating study was also performed. The ROS level in FSH-/eCG-stimulated granulosa cells was significantly increased. Moreover, high oxidative stress and mtDNA damage levels were evident in the granulosa cells. PQQ treatment not only reduced the ROS and oxidative stress levels but also ameliorated mtDNA damage, accelerated FSH-/eCG-induced ATP production, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and the expression levels of mitochondrial genes (Nd1, Cytb, Cox1, ATPase6) and the mt-ND1 protein. Accordingly, the proliferation and viability of granulosa cells, numbers of healthy preovulatory follicles and ovulated oocytes and serum estrogen level were significantly improved, while the apoptosis of granulosa cells was reduced. However, PQQ treatment did not change the fertility parameters in mature mice with natural cycles but did significantly increased the number of offspring born per delivery. These results revealed that ROS-associated damage in FSH-stimulated granulosa cells adversely affects their physiology and follicular health during the follicular development process. Treatment with PQQ is a beneficial tool to increase both the number of ovulated oocytes and pups per delivery.","Hoque, S A Masudul; Umehara, Takashi; Kawai, Tomoko; Shimada, Masayuki",Free radical biology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.12.434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385538/,333

85888,Improvement of olfactory function for quality of life recovery.,2013,"OBJECTIVES The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has strained many healthcare systems. In response, U.S. hospitals altered their care delivery systems, but there are few data regarding specific structural changes. Understanding these changes is important to guide interpretation of outcomes and inform pandemic preparedness. We sought to characterize emergency responses across hospitals in the United States over time and in the context of local case rates early in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN We surveyed hospitals from a national acute care trials group regarding operational and structural changes made in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from January to August 2020. We collected prepandemic characteristics and changes to hospital system, space, staffing, and equipment during the pandemic. We compared the timing of these changes with county-level coronavirus disease 2019 case rates. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS U.S. hospitals participating in the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network Coronavirus Disease 2019 Observational study. Site investigators at each hospital collected local data. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Forty-five sites participated (94% response rate). System-level changes (incident command activation and elective procedure cancellation) occurred at nearly all sites, preceding rises in local case rates. The peak inpatient census during the pandemic was greater than the prior hospital bed capacity in 57% of sites with notable regional variation. Nearly half (49%) expanded ward capacity, and 63% expanded ICU capacity, with nearly all bed expansion achieved through repurposing of clinical spaces. Two-thirds of sites adapted staffing to care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019, with 48% implementing tiered staffing models, 49% adding temporary physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists, and 30% changing the ratios of physicians or nurses to patients. CONCLUSIONS The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic prompted widespread system-level changes, but front-line clinical care varied widely according to specific hospital needs and infrastructure. Linking operational changes to care delivery processes is a necessary step to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on patient outcomes.","Mathews, Kusum S; Seitz, Kevin P; Vranas, Kelly C; Duggal, Abhijit; Valley, Thomas S; Zhao, Bo; Gundel, Stephanie; Harhay, Michael O; Chang, Steven Y; Hough, Catherine L",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826584/,333

We hypothesized that those infants who received >0.3 FiO2 during stabilization following delivery would have relatively higher rcSO2 postdelivery compared with those stabilized with a lower FiO2. STUDY DESIGN A single center prospective observational study of 47 infants born before 32 weeks. Using near infrared spectroscopy, rcSO2 values were recorded immediately after birth. All preterm infants were initially given 0.3 FiO2 and were divided into 2 groups according to subsequent FiO2 requirements of either ≤0.3 or >0.3 FiO2. Using a mixed-effects model, we compared the difference between the groups over time. Also, the area measures below 55% (hypoxia) and above 85% (hyperoxia) were compared between the groups. RESULTS The mean (SD) gestation was 29.4 (1.6) weeks and the mean (SD) weight was 1.3 (0.4) kg. Less than one-half of the infants (20/45; 43%) required ≤0.3 FiO2. In the delivery suite, the median (IQR) rcSO2 in the low and high FiO2 groups were 81% (66%-86%) and 72% (62%-86%), respectively. Patients in the high FiO2 group had a larger rcSO2 area below 55% (P = .01). There was a significant difference in rcSO2 between the groups (P < .05), with the low group having higher rcSO2 values initially, but this difference changed over time. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), rcSO2 values were lower by 7.1% (CI 12.13 to 2.06%) P = .008 in the high FiO2 group. CONCLUSIONS Infants given >0.3 FiO2 had more cerebral hypoxia than infants requiring ≤0.3 FiO2 but no difference in the degree of cerebral hyperoxia, both in the delivery suite and the NICU. This suggests that a more rapid increase in oxygen titration maybe be required initially for preterm infants.","Kenosi, Mmoloki; O'Toole, John M; Livingston, Vicki; Hawkes, Gavin A; Boylan, Geraldine B; O'Halloran, Ken D; Ryan, Anthony C; Dempsey, Eugene M",The Journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2015.07.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26387011/,333

90533,Special Report from the CDC: Strengthening social connections to prevent suicide and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs): Actions and opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common infectious disease cause of death. We summarize recent findings regarding the epidemiology of CAP in adults, efficacy of vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, diagnostics, and discuss the current controversy between CAP and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). RECENT FINDINGS The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the avian influenza A strain H7N9 are of concern but still these are infrequent causes of CAP. Recent data indicate that vaccinating children also protects adults against CAP by generating significant herd immunity, and that the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in adults may offer some efficacy in preventing CAP caused by vaccine serotypes. The immunochromotagraphic urinary antigen test has improved the diagnostic yield for the aetiology of CAP, and initial data demonstrate that a novel multiplex urinary antigen test will further increase the sensitivity for detection of S. pneumoniae. There has been significant concern that a relatively recently described pneumonia category, HCAP, requires empirical treatment for potentially multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). However, new evidence shows that (at least in Europe) pneumonia caused by MDRO remains uncommon even in HCAP category patients. SUMMARY CAP remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Advances in vaccination and diagnosis should help reduce the amount of disease due to S. pneumoniae, the commonest cause of CAP. Outside of the United States, MDRO are relatively uncommon causes of CAP, and the increased mortality of HCAP category patients seems to be related to their comorbidities and age rather than microbial aetiology.","José, Ricardo J; Periselneris, Jimstan N; Brown, Jeremy S",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775050/,333

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and at least half of the top 10 leading causes of death have been associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). A number of established risk factors for suicide and ACEs may have been exacerbated by the pandemic, including loneliness and the lack of connectedness. METHOD This article briefly considers the effects of COVID-19 on social connection and outlines the importance of adapting and developing programming and resources that address suicide and ACEs prevention during a time of infrastructure disruption. Practical Applications: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ways that many individuals are able to safely interact and socially connect due to public health prevention strategies implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19. Local, city, and state government, community organizations, and public health and medical practitioners should consider the adaptation and development of existing and new programming, resources, and activities that support and strengthen social connection. In addition to implementing programs, policies may help address systemic and structural barriers to social connection, such as access to parks and open space, public transportation, or digital connectivity.","Bledsoe, Martevia; Captanian, Alexis; Somji, Alisha",Journal of safety research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2021.03.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092325/,333

The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia are shown to be affected by some explanatory variables that are recorded daily: recovered COVID-19 cases, critical cases, daily active cases, tests per million, curfew hours, maximal temperatures, maximal relative humidity, maximal wind speed, and maximal pressure. Restrictions applied by the Saudi Arabia government due to the COVID-19 outbreak, from the suspension of Umrah and flights, and the lockdown of some cities with a curfew are based on information about COVID-15. The aim of the paper is to propose some predictive regression models similar to generalized linear models (GLMs) for fitting COVID-19 data in Saudi Arabia to analyze, forecast, and extract meaningful information that helps decision makers. In this direction, we propose some regression models on the basis of inverted exponential distribution (IE-Reg), Bayesian (BReg) and empirical Bayesian regression (EBReg) models for use in conjunction with inverted exponential distribution (IE-BReg and IE-EBReg). In all approaches, we use the logarithm (log) link function, gamma prior and two loss functions in the Bayesian approach, namely, the zero-one and LINEX loss functions. To deal with the outliers in the proposed models, we apply Huber and Tukey's bisquare (biweight) functions. In addition, we use the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to estimate Bayesian regression coefficients. Further, we compare IE-Reg, IE-BReg, and IE-EBReg using some criteria, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance (D), and mean squared error (MSE). Finally, we apply the collected data of the daily confirmed from March 23 - June 21, 2020 with the corresponding explanatory variables to the theoretical findings.

The patients hospitalized in ICU were older than patients hospitalized in wards (p=0.001) and expired patients were older than alive patients (p=0.001). Age, elevated serum D-dimer, creatinine, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels at admission were independent factors predicting ICU hospitalization and mortality in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION In conclusion, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, laboratory data on admission, including serum, creatinine, GGT and d-dimer levels have an important predictive role for the ICU requirement and mortality. Since these tests are readily available in all hospitals and inexpensive, some predictive formulas may be calculated with these parameters at admission, to define the patients requiring intensive care.","Kasapoglu, Benan; Yozgat, Ahmet; Tanoglu, Alpaslan; Can, Guray; Sakin, Yusuf Serdar; Kekilli, Murat",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34605109/,333

Studies have shown that uninsured patients with many cancers and chronic diseases have worse survival than insured patients. A recent study similarly showed that uninsured patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) have significantly shortened survival. While GEP-NETs are indolent tumors with generally favorable prognosis, comprehensive care involves years of surveillance, imaging, and treatment following resection, all of which carry a large financial burden. In this commentary, we expand on these findings as they relate to insurance-based disparities as well as management and policy implications.","Baechle, Jordan J; Smith, Paula Marincola; Idrees, Kamran",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2021.0126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421025/,333

Aims To determine the influence of simulated Mars gravity on the activity of four locomotor muscles while walking, in comparison to 1 G, using lower body positive pressure (LBPP). Material and Methods A total of 14 male subjects (mean age: 20.6 ± 2.4 years) performed bouts of walking in both simulated Mars gravity (0.38 G) and Earth gravity (1 G) using an LBPP device. The dependent variables were the muscle activity evoked in the tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, gluteus maximus and lateral portion of the gastrocnemius, measured using electromyography and expressed as percentages of maximum voluntary isometric contractions, and heart rate (HR). For statistical analysis, a paired t-test was performed. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Results No significant differences in muscle activity were found across conditions for any of the investigated muscles. A significant mean difference in the HR was identified between Earth (105.15 ± 8.1 bpm) and Mars (98.15 ± 10.44 bpm) conditions (P = 0.027), wherein the HR was lower during the Mars trial. Conclusions The Mars environment may not result in any deteriorative implications for the musculoskeletal system. However, if future research should report that stride frequency and thus activation frequency is decreased in the simulated Mars gravity, negative implications may be posed for muscle retention and reconditioning efforts on the Red Planet.","Hammond, Benjamin T; da Silva Melo, Denizar Alberto; de Farias, Rafael Pires; da Rosa, Michele; Lamadrid, Ingrid; Disiuta, Leandro; Marquesde Lima, Julio Cesar; Russomano, Thais",Neurology India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.259129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31134914/,333

METHODS A retrospective review was performed of a database that was prospectively collected from April 1991 to May 2005. Since operative time distributions were different, patients were divided into three groups: laparoscopic right colectomy or ileocecal resection, sigmoid resection, and total abdominal colectomy. The following outcomes were assessed: intraoperative and postoperative complications, days to surgical diet, length of stay, 30-day mortality, and the presence of a learning curve. RESULTS Following exclusions, there were 231 right colon and ileocecal resections, 210 sigmoid colectomies, and 46 total abdominal colectomies. With increasing operative time in both right/ileocecal and sigmoid resections, logistic regression demonstrated no significant association between intraoperative and postoperative complications, days to surgical diet, or length of stay. Weight was significantly correlated with increasing operative time in the right/ileocecal and sigmoid resection groups. In the total abdominal colectomy group, significant relationships between increased operative time and postoperative complications (P = 0.04), days to surgical diet (P = 0.02), and hospital stay (P = 0.03) were found. An operative time cut-point was determined in the total abdominal colectomy group. Patients with operative times >270 minutes were more likely to have postoperative complications (P = 0.024), longer ileus (five vs. three median days to surgical diet, P = 0.003), and longer length of stay (seven vs. five days, P = 0.04). This increased risk remained significant after adjusting for weight and diagnosis. No significant learning curve was identified. CONCLUSION Increasing operative time does not appear to adversely affect perioperative outcomes in segmental colectomies. Total abdominal colectomies lasting more than 270 minutes were associated with increased postoperative complications, days to surgical diet, and length of stay.","Scheer, Adena; Martel, Guillaume; Moloo, Husein; Sabri, Elham; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Boushey, Robin P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181b55616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19966608/,333
97230,Adapting trauma workflows for severely injured trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: experience in a regional trauma centre in Singapore.,2020-11-30,"PURPOSE To characterize the shielding design and leakage radiation from a newly released ring gantry linac (Halcyon, Varian Medical Systems). METHODS To assess the radiation leakage surrounding headshield and the radiation level after the beam stopper, measurements were made with GafChromic films. To evaluate the in-room radiation levels, the radiation leakage in the iso-center plane was measured with a large volume spherical ionization chamber (Exradin A6, Standard Imaging). A lead enclosure was constructed to shield the chamber from the low energy scatter radiation from the room. The radiation level at multiple locations was measured with the MLC fully closed and gantry at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270 and 315 degrees. The leakage radiation passing through multiple concrete slabs with various thickness was recorded in a narrow beam geometry to determine the tenth value layer (TVL). RESULTS A uniform leakage (<0.05%) at 1m from electron beam line was measured surrounding the linac head with the max leakage measured at the top of the head enclosure. The highest radiation level (<0.08%) was measured near the edge of the beam stopper when projected to the measurement plane. The maximum radiation levels due to the head leakage at 15 locations inside the treatment room were recorded and a radiation map was plotted. The maximum leakage was measured at points that along the electron beam line while the gantry at 90 or 270 degree and at the end of head enclosure (0.314%, 0.4 m from electron beamline). The leakage TVL value is found to be 226 mm in a narrow beam geometry with the concrete density of 2.16g/cm3 or 134.6 lb/cu.ft. CONCLUSION An overall uniform leakage was measured surrounding linac head. The beam stopper shields the primary radiation with the highest valued measured near the edge of beam stopper. The leakage TVL values are derived and lower than the values reported for conventional C-arm linac.","Cai, Bin; Laugeman, Eric; Hsu, HsinLu; Green, Olga; Knutson, Nels; Goddu, Murty; Mutic, Sasa; Du, Shuhua; Henke, Lauren; Kim, Hyun; Hugo, Geoffrey D",Medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763897/,333

The objective of the study is to design and validate the Scale of Worry for Contagion of COVID-19 (PRE-COVID-19). Method The study had a descriptive cross-sectional design. The population were young people and adults who resided in the cities of Lima and Callao (Perú) during the declaration of the national health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the period from March 16 to 27, 2020, who were recruited through a non-probability sample. The PRE-COVID-19, the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 and a single item were applied to measure the general perception of health. The scales were shared using a Google form through social networks. An internal consistency reliability analysis and structural equation models were performed, specifically confirmatory factor analysis. The recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles that guide the ethical practice of online studies were followed. Results Eight hundred and sixteen young people and adults from Lima and Callao (200 men and 616 women; mean age 28.40, SD 7.10) participated. The results show a one-dimensional model with satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices: χ2 (9) = 52.00; CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.09 [0.07, 0.12]; WRMR = 0.85. The λ of the model were higher than 0.50 and the reliability had an excellent value (ω = 0.90). Likewise, the convergent and discriminant validity is evident between PRE-COVID-19 and measures of anxiety, well-being and self-reported health. Conclusion The results indicate that the PRE-COVID-19 is a valid and reliable instrument to measure concern about the spread of COVID-19 and the emotional impact on people.","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Ventura-León, José; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel",Enfermeria clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.10.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025116/,333

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.","Zhou, Wei Ke; Wang, Ai Li; Xia, Fan; Xiao, Yan Ni; Tang, San Yi",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2020147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233561/,333
99831,"COVID-19: What have we learnt, and plan for the future.",2020-05-01,"The advent of immunotherapy has changed the management and therapeutic methods for a variety of malignant tumors in the last decade. Unlike traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, which works by interfering with cancer cell growth via various pathways and stages of the cell cycle, cancer immunotherapy uses the immune system to reduce malignant cells' ability to escape the immune system and combat cell proliferation. The widespread use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) over the past 10 years has presented valuable information on the profiles of toxic adverse effects. The attenuation of T-lymphocyte inhibitory mechanisms by ICIs results in immune system hyperactivation, which, as expected, is associated with various adverse events defined by inflammation. These adverse events, known as immune-related adverse events (ir-AEs), may affect any type of tissue throughout the human body, which includes the digestive tract, endocrine glands, liver and skin, with reports of cardiovascular, pulmonary and rheumatic ir-AEs as well. The adverse events that arise from ICI therapy are both novel and unique compared to those of the conventional treatment options.

This study compares the safety and efficacy of transumbilical thoracoscopy and conventional thoracoscopy for lung wedge resection. METHODS The animals (n = 16) were randomly assigned to the transumbilical thoracoscopic approach group (n = 8) or conventional thoracoscopic approach group (n = 8). Transumbilical lung resection was performed via an umbilical incision and a diaphragmatic incision. In the conventional thoracoscopic group, lung resection was completed through a thoracic incision. For both procedures, we compared the surgical outcomes, for example, operating time and operative complications; physiologic parameters, for example, respiratory rate and body temperature; inflammatory parameters, for example, white blood cell count; and pulmonary parameters, for example, arterial blood gas levels. The animals were euthanized 2 weeks after the surgery for gross and histologic evaluations. RESULTS The lung wedge resection was successfully performed in all animals. There was no significant difference in the mean operating times or complications between the transumbilical and the conventional thoracoscopic approach groups. With regard to the physiologic impact of the surgeries, the transumbilical approach was associated with significant elevations in body temperature on postoperative day 1, when compared with the standard thoracoscopic approach.

METHODS Students (aged 11-14; grades 7-8) who received a 3-month teacher-delivered intervention embedded in the language arts curriculum (N=200) were compared to a wait-list control group (N=230) in the largest urban school board in Canada. Suicidality defined as a composite measure of self-reported suicidal ideation and attempts [primary outcome], self-reported emotion dysregulation, interpersonal chaos, confusion about self, and impulsivity [Life Problems Inventory (LPI)] and self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms [Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS)] were the outcomes of interest. Measurements occurred prior to and after curriculum delivery with independent t-tests used to compare mean change scores between groups clustered by class. RESULTS Thirty-seven English teachers in 46 classes across 15 schools comprised the planned study cohort. Composite suicidality scores were significantly worse in the control than intervention group at endpoint (0.05±0.54 vs. 0.17±0.47, t= -2.60, df=428, p=0.01). There were also significant improvements in LPI and RCADS scores in the intervention group compared to controls (LPI:-3.74±7.98 vs. 1.16±10.77 t=5.28, df=428, p<.001; RCADS: (-3.08±5.49 vs. -1.51±6.53 t=2.96, df=429, p=0.01). Sub-analyses revealed that these improvements were largely driven by a significant difference in scores in girls.

The rapidly (IKr) and slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) mediated by channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related- gene (hERG) and KCNQ1+KCNE1, respectively, are two main currents responsible for ventricular repolarization. The common cause for drugs to induce LQTS is through impairing the hERG channel. For the recent emergence of COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), several drugs have been investigated as potential therapies, however there are concerns about their QT prolongation risk. Here we study the effects of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir on hERG channels. Our results showed that while chloroquine acutely blocked hERG current (IhERG) with an IC50 of 3.0 µM, hydroxychloroquine acutely blocked IhERG 8-fold less potently, with an IC50 of 23.4 µM. Azithromycin and remdesivir did not acutely affect IhERG When these drugs at 10 µM were added to the cell culture medium for 24 h, remdesivir increased IhERG by two-fold, which was associated with an increased mature hERG channel expression. In addition, these four drugs did not acutely or chronically affect KCNQ1+KCNE1 channels. Our data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns. Significance Statement This work demonstrates that among off-label potential COVID-19 treatment drugs chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, the former two drugs block hERG potassium channels while the latter two drugs do not. All four drugs do not affect KCNQ1+KCNE1. As hERG and KCNQ1+KCNE1 are two main K+ channels responsible for ventricular repolarization, and most drugs that induce long QT syndrome (LQTS) do so by impairing hERG channels, our data provide insight into COVID-19 drug-associated LQTS and cardiac safety concerns.","Szendrey, Mark; Guo, Jun; Li, Wentao; Yang, Tonghua; Zhang, Shetuan",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.120.000484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33674391/,333

There is no adequate information to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute appendicitis and its surgical management. The present comparative study reports successful appendectomy and infection control in patients with appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic and last year covering the same period. METHODS This retrospective observational study was conducted in acute appendicitis-treated patients from 13.03.19 to 13.05.19 and from 13.03.20 to 13.05.20, respectively. RESULTS This study included 150 patients (110 patients in 2019; 40 patients in 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic)). The patients were named as Group A (Normal period) and Group B (Pandemic period), respectively. The groups were comparable as there was no significant difference between the mean age, mean BMI, and mean length of stay. There is a significant difference between the comorbidities of Group A and Group B (p=0.033). There was no significant difference between the laboratory and radiological findings of Group A and Group B. There was a significant difference between the perforation number of Group A and Group B (p=0.029). There was no significant difference between the needs of ICU and conversion from laparoscopic to conventional appendectomy of Group A and Group B. CONCLUSION The findings obtained in this study suggest that late admission to the hospital caused complicated cases and made acute appendicitis management more difficult during the pandemic period, which was already a troubling period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the principles applied to emergency surgery for infected patients should be applied to both suspected and confirmed cases.","Meriç, Serhat; Vartanoglu Aktokmakyan, Talar; Tokocin, Merve; Aktimur, Yunus Emre; Hacım, Nadir Adnan; Gülcicek, Osman Bilgin",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,https://doi.org/10.14744/tjtes.2020.46487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394473/,333

Gaming has been recognized as a coping mechanism against stress in the previously published literature. Objectives The current study aimed to assess the gaming behavior of college students during the lockdown following COVID-19. Methods Data were collected from a cohort of students that constituted the sampling frame of an ongoing project. A total of 393 college students were enrolled. All the eligible students were subsequently contacted through E-mail and WhatsApp messenger and invited to share the details. Results About half (50.8%) of the participants reported that their gaming behavior had increased, whereas 14.6% reported a decrease in their gaming during the lockdown period. In binary logistic regression analysis, hours of gaming per day (odds ratio [OR] 1.75 [1.29-2.36]), increase in gaming due to examination related stress (OR 4.96 [1.12-21.98]), and belief that gaming helps managing stress (OR 4.27 [1.65-11.04]), were found to be independently associated with gaming behavior during lockdown period. Conclusion In the lockdown period following COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in gaming behavior was associated with examination-related stress and the belief that gaming helps combat stress. These observations highlight the need to focus on the coping style of the students to ascertain the likelihood of them engaging in gaming behavior as a coping mechanism against stress.","Balhara, Yatan Pal Singh; Kattula, Dheeraj; Singh, Swarndeep; Chukkali, Surekha; Bhargava, Rachna",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_465_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32496250/,333
105117,Machine Learning-Based Early Warning Systems for Clinical Deterioration: Systematic Scoping Review.,2021-02-04,"OBJECTIVE To characterize symptoms and disease severity among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, along with laboratory findings, imaging, and clinical outcomes. METHODS Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection were identified at two affiliated hospitals in New York City from March 13 to April 19, 2020, for this case series study. Women were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on either universal testing on admission or testing because of COVID-19-related symptoms. Disease was classified as either 1) asymptomatic or mild or 2) moderate or severe based on dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia. Clinical and demographic risk factors for moderate or severe disease were analyzed and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Laboratory findings and associated symptoms were compared between those with mild or asymptomatic and moderate or severe disease. The clinical courses and associated complications of women hospitalized with moderate and severe disease are described. RESULTS Of 158 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, 124 (78%) had mild or asymptomatic disease and 34 (22%) had moderate or severe disease. Of 15 hospitalized women with moderate or severe disease, 10 received respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and one required intubation. Women with moderate or severe disease had a higher likelihood of having an underlying medical comorbidity (50% vs 27%, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26-6.02). Asthma was more common among those with moderate or severe disease (24% vs 8%, OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.26-9.75). Women with moderate or severe disease were significantly more likely to have leukopenia and elevated aspartate transaminase and ferritin. Women with moderate or severe disease were at significantly higher risk for cough and chest pain and pressure. Nine women received ICU or step-down-level care, including four for 9 days or longer. Two women underwent preterm delivery because their clinical status deteriorated. CONCLUSION One in five pregnant women who contracted COVID-19 infection developed moderate or severe disease, including a small proportion with prolonged critical illness who received ICU or step-down-level care.","Andrikopoulou, Maria; Madden, Nigel; Wen, Timothy; Aubey, Janice J; Aziz, Aleha; Baptiste, Caitlin D; Breslin, Noelle; DʼAlton, Mary E; Fuchs, Karin M; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Matseoane-Peterssen, Dara N; Miller, Russell S; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Simpson, Lynn L; Sutton, Desmond; Zork, Noelia; Friedman, Alexander M",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32459701/,333

The emergence of the technique can be of greater use both to patients and to the colorectal specialty if its principles can be merged into next-stage evolution by synergy with more conventional practice. In particular, rather than device specificity, what is needed is convergence of capability that can be applied by the same surgeon in differing scenarios depending on the individualized patient and disease characteristics. We detail here the global applicability of a simple access device construct that allows the provision of simple and complex single-port laparoscopy as well as contributing to multiport laparoscopic and transanal resections in a manner that is reliable, reproducible, ergonomical and economical.","Cahill, R A; Hompes, R; Cunningham, C; Mortensen, N J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2011.02771.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098509/,333
105952,Reassessing advance care planning in the light of covid-19.,2020-05-18,"BACKGROUND Cryptosporidium spp. are worldwide protozoan parasites which include species that can lead to cryptosporidiosis in humans. Different animal species can serve as reservoirs and sources of dissemination of the disease, such as rodent species due their potential in transmitting zoonotic pathogens to humans and other animals. In the Canary Islands (Spain), Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis have been identified in patients with diarrhea. However, the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. in possible reservoirs in this archipelago remains unclear. Considering the zoonotic potential of these protozoans, the aim of the present study was to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in peridomestic wild rodents and the possible role of these mammals as a source of transmission of these protozoans in Canary Islands. METHODS A total of 179 rodents belonging to Rattus rattus and Mus musculus domesticus from four Canary Islands, La Palma, El Hierro, Tenerife and Lanzarote, were analyzed. Feces were screened for Cryptosporidium spp. by nested PCR of the 18S ribosomal RNA fragment and the sequences used for phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS Cryptosporidium spp. were found widely distributed with an overall prevalence of 12.30% in rodents (13.86% for R. rattus and 10.25% for M. m. domesticus). The overall prevalence by island was 19.60% for Tenerife, 7.14% for La Palma, 5.71% for El Hierro and 0% for Lanzarote. Cryptosporidium tyzzeri, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium sp. rat genotype I and II/III were successfully identified, in addition to two unidentified Cryptosporidium genotypes. CONCLUSIONS This study contributes to the knowledge of the biodiversity and distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rodents from the Canary Islands, highlighting the presence of three zoonotic species, C. tyzzeri, C. meleagridis and C. muris, being the first detection of these three species in wild rodents in the Canary Islands and the first report of C. meleagridis in R. rattus. Given the results obtained in our study, future studies in non-sampled areas are required to better understand the epidemiology of these protozoans in wild rodents in the archipelago.","García-Livia, Katherine; Martín-Alonso, Aarón; Foronda, Pilar",Parasites & vectors,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04330-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887646/,333

RECENT FINDINGS Identifying predictors of adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery is vital in the decision-making process for surgeons and patients. Recently, automated risk calculators have been developed to quantify patient-specific preoperative risk associated with certain orthopedic procedures. Automated risk calculators may provide the orthopedic surgeon with a valuable tool for clinical decision-making, informed consent, and the shared decision-making process with the patient. Understanding how an automated risk calculator was developed is arguably as important as the performance of the calculator. Additionally, conveying and interpreting the results of these risk calculators with the patient and its influence on surgical decision-making are paramount. The most abundant research on automated risk calculators has been conducted in the spine, total hip and knee arthroplasty, and trauma literature. Currently, many risk calculators show promise, but much research is still needed to improve them. We recommend they be used only as adjuncts to clinical decision-making. Understanding how a calculator was developed, and accurate communication of results to the patient, is paramount.","Merrill, Robert K; Ibrahim, John M; Machi, Anthony S; Raphael, James S",Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12178-020-09632-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418072/,333

109181,Expanding coverage for essential care during COVID-19.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND Human connection is at the heart of medical care, but questions remain as to the effectiveness of interpersonal interventions. The purpose of this review was to characterize the associations between patient-provider interpersonal interventions and the quadruple aim outcomes (population health, patient experience, cost, and provider experience). METHODS We sourced data from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo (January 1997-August 2017). Selected studies included randomized controlled trials and controlled observational studies that examined the association between patient-provider interpersonal interventions and at least one outcome measure of the quadruple aim. Two abstractors independently extracted information about study design, methods, and quality. We characterized evidence related to the objective of the intervention, type and duration of intervention training, target recipient (provider-only vs. provider-patient dyad), and quadruple aim outcomes. RESULTS Seventy-three out of 21,835 studies met the design and outcome inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of research was moderate to high for most included studies; 67% of interventions targeted the provider. Most studies measured impact on patient experience; improvements in experience (e.g., satisfaction, patient-centeredness, reduced unmet needs) often corresponded with a positive impact on other patient health outcomes (e.g., quality of life, depression, adherence). Enhanced interpersonal interactions improved provider well-being, burnout, stress, and confidence in communicating with difficult patients. Roughly a quarter of studies evaluated cost, but the majority reported no significant differences between intervention and control groups. Among studies that measured time in the clinical encounter, intervention effects varied. Interventions with lower demands on provider time and effort were often as effective as those with higher demands. DISCUSSION Simple, low-demand patient-provider interpersonal interventions may have the potential to improve patient health and patient and provider experience, but there is limited evidence that these interventions influence cost-related outcomes.","Haverfield, Marie C; Tierney, Aaron; Schwartz, Rachel; Bass, Michelle B; Brown-Johnson, Cati; Zionts, Dani L; Safaeinili, Nadia; Fischer, Meredith; Shaw, Jonathan G; Thadaney, Sonoo; Piccininni, Gabriella; Lorenz, Karl A; Asch, Steven M; Verghese, Abraham; Zulman, Donna M",Journal of general internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-019-05525-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31919725/,333

109286,Cross-sectional Imaging Manifestations of Extrapulmonary Involvement in COVID-19 Disease.,2020-11-12,"PURPOSE Effective, consistent, and complication-free treatment of cerebral bifurcation aneurysms remains elusive despite a pressing need, with the majority of lesions presenting in such locations. Current treatment options focus either on aneurysm coil retention, supported by a stent-like device positioned in the parent vessel lumen, or intrasaccular devices that disrupt flow within the aneurysm dome. A third alternative, i.e., the use of conventional (intraluminal) flow-diverters to treat such bifurcation aneurysms raises the problem that at least one daughter vessel needs to be jailed in such a deployment. The eCLIPs is a stent-like device that offers the possibility of flow-diversion at the aneurysm neck, without the drawbacks of daughter vessel occlusion or those of intrasaccular deployment. METHODS In this study the eCLIPs device was virtually deployed in five cerebral bifurcation aneurysms and compared with a conventional tubular flow-diverter device. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the aneurysm haemodynamic environment pre- and post-implantation were conducted, and focussed on metrics associated with successful aneurysm occlusion. Absolute and relative reductions in aneurysm inflow rate (Q) and time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) were recorded. RESULTS The eCLIPs device was found to perform in a similar qualitative fashion to tubular flow-diverters, with overall reduction of metrics being somewhat more modest however, when compared to such devices. Aneurysm inflow reduction and TAWSS reduction were typically 10-20% lower for the eCLIPs, when compared to a generic flow diverter (FDBRAIDED) similar to devices currently in clinical use. The eCLIPs was less effective at diffusing inflow jets and at reducing the overall velocity of the flow, when compared to these devices. This result is likely due to the larger device pore size in the eCLIPs. Notably, it was found that the eCLIPs provided approximately equal resistance to flow entering and exiting the aneurysm, which was not true for the FDBRAIDED device, where high-speed concentrations of outflow were seen at the aneurysm neck along with local TAWSS elevation. The clinical implications of such behaviour are not examined in detail here but could be significant. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that the eCLIPs device acts as a flow-diverter for bifurcation aneurysms, with somewhat diminished occlusion properties comparing to tubular flow diverters but without the jailing and diminished flow evident in a daughter vessel associated with use of conventional devices.","Peach, T W; Ricci, D; Ventikos, Y",Cardiovascular engineering and technology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13239-019-00424-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286438/,333
109413,Number of Healthcare Workers Who Have Died of COVID-19.,2020-06-05,"Reduced maximal force capability of skeletal muscle, as a consequence of exercise, can be due to peripheral or central fatigue mechanisms. In upper-limb muscles, neuromuscular fatigue is concurrent with reduced corticospinal excitability and increased inhibition (lengthened corticospinal silent period [CSP]; reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition [SICI] ratio). However, it is unclear whether these adjustments occur in response to fatiguing exercise of locomotor muscles. This study examined the effect of fatiguing, maximal, knee-extensor exercise on motor cortical excitability and inhibition. Thirteen males performed three 30-s maximal, isometric contractions with the dominant knee-extensors (MVC1, MVC2 and MVC3), separated by 60 s. At the end of, and between each MVC, neuromuscular fatigue, corticospinal excitability, CSP and SICI were assessed with supramaximal stimulation of the femoral nerve, and motor cortical stimulation, respectively. Repeated MVCs caused progressive reductions in MVC (- 10, - 24 and - 29%, respectively, P ≤ 0.01), along with significant peripheral (reductions in potentiated twitch of - 23, -53 and - 60%, respectively, P < 0.001) and central (reductions in VA of - 10% and - 13% post-MVC2 and 3, respectively, P ≤ 0.01) fatigue. Following MVC1 corticospinal excitability was reduced, and remained depressed thereafter. CSP increased in duration and remained longer throughout the protocol; whereas, no change in SICI was observed. Repeated, sustained, maximal contractions of the knee-extensors elicited substantial peripheral and central fatigue that was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in corticospinal excitability. However, divergent responses exist between inhibitory networks within the motor cortex, the activity of inhibitory networks mediated by GABAB are increased, whereas those mediated by GABAA are not.","Goodall, Stuart; Howatson, Glyn; Thomas, Kevin",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-017-5142-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29214392/,333

Early on, increased loneliness has been publicly discussed as a harmful psychological side effect of these measures. Due to the serious adverse health consequences of loneliness, it is essential to take these concerns seriously and investigate them systematically to allow for evidence-based decision making. Thus far, however, high-resolution empirical evidence of such harmful side effects is rare. METHODS The present preregistered large-scale daily diary study assessed daily loneliness in 4,844 German adults between March 16 and April 12, 2020. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Daily loneliness slightly increased during the first two weeks since implementing the pandemic-related measures and slightly decreased thereafter. With increasing age, daily loneliness increased more strongly over the four weeks. Moreover, daily loneliness increased more strongly for parents compared to people without children. Thus, despite some increases in loneliness in some individuals, there was no linear increase in loneliness in response to the first pandemic-related measures in the present sample.","Buecker, Susanne; Horstmann, Kai T; Krasko, Julia; Kritzler, Sarah; Terwiel, Sophia; Kaiser, Till; Luhmann, Maike",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248868/,333

Historical accounts of influenza pandemics and contemporary reports on infectious diseases clearly demonstrate that poverty, inequality, and social determinants of health create conditions for the transmission of infectious diseases, and existing health disparities or inequalities can further contribute to unequal burdens of morbidity and mortality. Yet, to date, studies of influenza pandemic plans across multiple countries find little to no recognition of health inequalities or attempts to engage disadvantaged populations to explicitly address the differential impact of a pandemic on them. To meet the goals and objectives of the Global Health Security Agenda, we argue that international partners, from WHO to individual countries, must grapple with the social determinants of health and existing health inequalities and extend their vision to include these factors so that disease that may start among socially disadvantaged subpopulations does not go unnoticed and spread across borders. These efforts will require rethinking surveillance systems to include sociodemographic data; training local teams of researchers and community health workers who are able to not only analyze data to recognize risk factors for disease, but also use simulation methods to assess the impact of alternative policies on reducing disease; integrating social science disciplines to understand local context; and proactively anticipating shortfalls in availability of adequate healthcare resources, including vaccines. Without explicit attention to existing health inequalities and underlying social determinants of health, the Global Health Security Agenda is unlikely to succeed in its goals and objectives.","Quinn, Sandra Crouse; Kumar, Supriya","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",https://doi.org/10.1089/bsp.2014.0032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25254915/,333

To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the regulation of breathing during sedation with dexmedetomidine, the authors compared ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia during sedation with dexmedetomidine and propofol. METHODS Eleven healthy male volunteers entered this randomized crossover study. Sedation was administered as an intravenous bolus followed by an infusion and monitored by Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, and Bispectral Index Score. Hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses were measured at rest, during sedation (OAA/S 2 to 4), and after recovery. Drug exposure was verified with concentration analysis in plasma. RESULTS Ten subjects completed the study. The OAA/S at the sedation goal was 3 (3 to 4) (median [minimum to maximum]) for both drugs. Bispectral Index Score was 82 ± 8 and 75 ± 3, and the drug concentrations in plasma at the sedation target were 0.66 ± 0.14 and 1.26 ± 0.36 μg/ml for dexmedetomidine and propofol, respectively. Compared with baseline, sedation reduced hypoxic ventilation to 59 and 53% and the hypercapnic ventilation to 82 and 86% for dexmedetomidine and propofol, respectively. In addition, some volunteers displayed upper airway obstruction and episodes of apnea during sedation. CONCLUSIONS Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation reduces ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia to a similar extent as sedation with propofol. This finding implies that sedation with dexmedetomidine interacts with both peripheral and central control of breathing.","Lodenius, Åse; Ebberyd, Anette; Hårdemark Cedborg, Anna; Hagel, Eva; Mkrtchian, Souren; Christensson, Eva; Ullman, Johan; Scheinin, Mika; Eriksson, Lars I; Jonsson Fagerlund, Malin",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000001236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27483127/,333

A technique using single-incision laparoscopic surgery through the stoma site (SIL RoH) has been shown to be feasible and safe. In this study, we compared clinical outcomes of SIL RoH with conventional laparoscopic surgery (CL) and open surgery (OS). METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database between 2007 and 2017 in a UK colorectal unit. The access technique was decided by the surgeon on a case by case basis. RESULTS A total of 106 patients underwent RoH. It was carried out for diverticular disease (n = 71, 67.6%), cancer (n = 19, 17.9%) and anastomotic leak (n = 4, 3.8%). The remainder (n = 12, 11.3%) were for miscellaneous reasons including trauma. Most RoHs were performed via OS (n = 87, 81.1%). The most common intended approaches for RoH were SIL (n = 56, 52.8%) and OS (n = 34, 32.1%) with fewer starting with CL (n = 16, 15.1%). Conversion to OS took place in five (8.9%) patients with SIL and six (37.5%) with CL (P = 0.005). Postoperative complications occurred in 17 (30.4%) for SIL, seven (43.8%) for CL and 17 (50.0%) for OS (P = 0.162). Median operating time for SIL was 146 min (range 44-389), 211 min (109-320) for CL and 211 min (85-420) for OS (P < 0.001). Median length of stay was 4 days (2-44) for SIL compared to 6 (3-34) for CL and 7 (4-34) for OS (P < 0.001). Discharge on or before day 5 was achieved in 41 (74.5%) patients for SIL compared to six (37.5%) for CL and seven (20.6%) for OS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Compared to OS and CL, SIL RoH appears to have shorter operating times and hospitalization, with no discernible difference in morbidity; this finding requires further evaluation in a randomized setting.","Thambi, P; Borowski, D W; Sathasivam, R; Obuobi, R-B; Viswanath, Y K S; Gill, T S",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.14617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897258/,333
114855,Risks associated with opioid use.,2013,"BACKGROUND Polypharmacy is a key challenge in healthcare especially in older and multimorbid patients. The use of multiple medications increases the potential for drug interactions and for prescription of potentially inappropriate medications. eHealth solutions are increasingly recommended in healthcare, with big data analysis techniques as a major component. In the following we use the term analysis of big data as referring to the computational analysis of large data sets to find patterns, trends, and associations in large data sets collected from a wide range of sources in contrast to using classical statistics programs. It is hypothesized that big data analysis is able to reveal patterns in patient data that would not be identifiable using conventional methods of data analysis. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether there are existing big data analysis techniques that can help to identify patients consuming multiple drugs and to assist in the reduction of polypharmacy in patients. METHODS A computerized search was conducted in February 2019 and updated in May 2020, using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. The search strategy was defined by the principles of a systematic search, using the PICO scheme. All studies evaluating big data analytics about patients consuming multiple drugs were considered. Two researchers assessed all search results independently to identify eligible studies. The data was then extracted into standardized tables. RESULTS A total of 327 studies were identified through the database search. After title and abstract screening, 302 items were removed. Only three studies were identified as addressing big data analysis techniques in patients with polypharmacy. One study extracted antipsychotic polypharmacy data, the second introduced a decision support system to evaluate side-effects in patients with polypharmacy and the third evaluated a decision support system to identify polypharmacy-related problems in individuals. CONCLUSIONS There are few studies to date which have used big data analysis techniques for identification and management of polypharmacy. There may be a need to further explore interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and healthcare professionals, to develop and evaluate big data analysis techniques that can be implemented to manage polypharmacy.","Wilfling, D; Hinz, A; Steinhäuser, J",BMC family practice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01247-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883227/,333

METHODS Educational needs in the target group were investigated using a questionnaire. Themes and subthemes extracted from responses informed the curriculum formulation of the CPD programme, which was completed using a variety of learning, assessment and evaluation methods. RESULTS Forty-six paediatricians identified 355 clinical situations. Competencies in general paediatrics and educational skills were incorporated in a CPD programme, implemented in western Sweden between 13 October 2016 and 23 May 2019, with 23 learning modules and 18 participants (male/female 3/15, median age 55 years). The participants' evaluation emphasised the importance of adult learning principles. Their responses to open reflective questions on 23 May 2109 suggested that the programme offered a learning environment in which they could develop their paediatric and educational practices and improve their mentorship, networks and work-based learning environment. They also described an enhanced feeling of joy at work. CONCLUSION The involvement of experienced paediatricians in the programme formulation may be inspirational to clinicians and contribute to the definition, revitalisation and prioritisation of general paediatrics in Sweden in the future.","Wekell, Per; Kullberg-Lindh, Carola; Vallo Hult, Helena; Velander, Helena; Holmgren, Daniel",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905561/,333
118658,Case Report of an Influenza Outbreak in the Sports Medicine Setting.,2021-04-01,"The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly altered people's daily lives and created multiple societal challenges. One important challenge of this unique stressor is maintaining well-functioning intimate relationships, which are inextricably tied to emotional and physical health. Yet research on romantic relationships shows that external stressors such as economic hardship, demanding jobs, and disasters can threaten the quality and stability of couples' relationships. Research within relationship science investigating how external stressors and existing vulnerabilities shape couple functioning can inform predictions about how the current pandemic will impact couples' relationships and which couples in which contexts may be most at risk for adverse relationship consequences. Drawing on theory and research from relationship science, the presented conceptual framework, adapted from the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995), suggests that facing COVID-19-related external stress is likely to increase harmful dyadic processes (e.g., hostility, withdrawal, less responsive support), which will undermine couples' relationship quality. These harmful effects are likely to be exacerbated by the broader preexisting context in which couples' relationships are situated (e.g., social class, minority status, age), and their individual vulnerabilities (e.g., attachment insecurity, depression). The framework presented identifies the essential factors that need to be addressed in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current crisis on relationships, and offers key directions for future research.

Here, we investigate whether maternal influenza infection has adverse effects on immune responses in offspring. We establish a two-hit mouse model to study the effect of maternal influenza A virus infection (first hit) on vulnerability of offspring to heterologous infections (second hit) in later life. Offspring born to influenza A virus infected mothers are stunted in growth and more vulnerable to heterologous infections (influenza B virus and MRSA) than those born to PBS- or poly(I:C)-treated mothers. Enhanced vulnerability to infection in neonates is associated with reduced haematopoetic development and immune responses. In particular, alveolar macrophages of offspring exposed to maternal influenza have reduced capacity to clear second hit pathogens. This impaired pathogen clearance is partially reversed by adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages from healthy offspring born to uninfected dams. These findings suggest that maternal influenza infection may impair immune ontogeny and increase susceptibility to early life infections of offspring.","Jacobsen, Henning; Walendy-Gnirß, Kerstin; Tekin-Bubenheim, Nilgün; Kouassi, Nancy Mounogou; Ben-Batalla, Isabel; Berenbrok, Nikolaus; Wolff, Martin; Dos Reis, Vinicius Pinho; Zickler, Martin; Scholl, Lucas; Gries, Annette; Jania, Hanna; Kloetgen, Andreas; Düsedau, Arne; Pilnitz-Stolze, Gundula; Jeridi, Aicha; Yildirim, Ali Önder; Fuchs, Helmut; Gailus-Durner, Valerie; Stoeger, Claudia; de Angelis, Martin Hrabe; Manuylova, Tatjana; Klingel, Karin; Culley, Fiona J; Behrends, Jochen; Loges, Sonja; Schneider, Bianca; Krauss-Etschmann, Susanne; Openshaw, Peter; Gabriel, Gülsah",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25220-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400653/,333

121090,Buprenorphine Opioid Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic-Reply.,2021-04-12,"INTRODUCTION/AIMS Cortical hyperexcitability is a feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cortical excitability can be measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Resting motor threshold (MT) is a measure of cortical excitability, largely driven by glutamate. Perampanel, a glutamate α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor blocker, is predicted to increase the cortical excitability threshold. This study aimed to evaluate TMS tp functionally assess target engagement in a study of perampanel in ALS. METHOD We studied the MT of ALS patients randomized to a single dose of perampanel or placebo 5:1 hourly for 4 hours. Twelve patients participated at 4 mg and 7 returned for dosing and retesting at 8 mg. The study was terminated in April 2020 due to COVID-19-related restrictions, after 7 out of 12 planned patients had received the 8mg dose. Serum concentrations were also measured. RESULTS Ten patients received the 4mg dose (2 received placebo) and 5 received the 8mg dose (2 received placebo). Motor Threshold increased at two hours after dosing in the combined treatment group +7% of maximal stimulator output (MSO) (p<0.01). Change could be detected in the larger 4 mg group (p=0.02), but not in the smaller 8 mg dose group (p=0.1). No side effects were reported after single dose exposure. DISCUSSION This study shows that perampanel effects the physiology of upper motor neurons. Studies aiming at gauging the effect of perampanel on ALS disease progression are already ongoing. Motor threshold may serve as a marker of biological target engagement. This article is protected by copyright.

122366,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Intestinal Failure Healthcare Delivery.,2020-09-17,"COVID-19 is an acute infectious respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The disease is highly communicable and produces mild to severe symptoms, generating a high demand for intensive care and thousands of deaths. In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and has already surpassed five million cases and 300,000 deaths in the world. The natural history of the disease has still not been fully established, hindering the elaboration of effective clinical protocols and preventive measures. Nevertheless, the disease requires a systemic approach, since there is evidence of acute and chronic complications, in addition to the catastrophic effects on the population's mental health. This highlights the need for a methodology that more effectively captures the effect of COVID-19, considering such aspects as severity, duration, and the potential to generate chronic complications that will increase the demands on Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). DALYs, or disability-adjusted life years, are thus an extremely useful indictor that adds mortality, an estimate of years of life lost (YLLs), and morbidity, an estimate of years of life lived with disability (YLDs). This article discusses the relevance and difficulties of studying the burden of COVID-19 and its complications in the Brazilian context, highlighting the natural history of the disease and estimating indicators such as YLDs, considering the high burden of disease in planning strategies to deal with the consequences of COVID-19 after the pandemic. The article also discusses the future challenges to deal with the disease in the SUS and the effects on the calculation of DALYs.","Campos, Mônica Rodrigues; Schramm, Joyce Mendes de Andrade; Emmerick, Isabel Cristina Martins; Rodrigues, Jéssica Muzy; Avelar, Fernando Genovez de; Pimentel, Thiago Goes",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00148920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33146278/,333

123820,"Out of sight, out of mind: the invisibility of female African athletes in sports and exercise medicine research.",2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND Embolization might complicate device closure of large atrial septal defects (ASDs) with deficient margins. When margins are deficient, a precariously placed device can appear to be held in good position by the rigid delivery cable. Once the cable is unscrewed, the device adopts the natural lie of the interatrial septum. This can occasionally expose the inadequately captured margins and lead to device embolization. Most embolizations occur immediately after release. Retrieval of the embolized device required prolonged fluoroscopy and sometimes open heart surgery. OBJECTIVE To evolve a new strategy of retrieval of a malpositioned device after unscrewing the cable before impending embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS After deploying the device in place, a snare is passed through the delivery sheath around the cable to grip the screw on the right atrial disc of the device. With the snare holding the screw end, the device is released by unscrewing the cable. The device position is reconfirmed on echocardiography. The snare is subsequently removed if the device was stable. In case of device migration, the same snare is used to retrieve the device before it embolizes completely. RESULTS Snare assistance was used in 24 patients considered as high-risk for device embolization. Its usefulness was demonstrated in two patients with deficient posterior margin and small inferior margin where the device got malpositioned immediately after release. As the snare was still holding on to the screw end, the device could be retrieved into the sheath easily. CONCLUSION This novel snare assisted device release strategy safeguards against device embolization in large ASDs with deficient rims and allows simplified retrieval.","Pavithran, Sreeja; Sivakumar, Kothandam",Annals of pediatric cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/0974-2069.164685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26556964/,333
124747,"Emergency hospital admissions associated with non-communicable diseases 1998-2018 in England, Wales and Scotland: an ecological study.",2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with increased complication rates postoperatively. Current literature does not provide adequate guidance on management of these patients. This study used the STOP-Bang questionnaire to diagnose patients with possible obstructive sleep apnea (score ≥3). We hypothesized that a STOP-Bang score of 3 or greater would significantly correlate with the number of oxygen desaturation episodes during the first 48 hours after total knee arthroscopy. METHODS The STOP-Bang questionnaire was administered to 110 patients preoperatively. All patients underwent spinal-epidural anesthesia with a saphenous nerve block and sedation and were connected to the Nellcor OxiMax N-600x pulse oximeter for 48 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Final analysis included 98 patients. There was no significant difference in the total number of desaturation events between STOP-Bang groups (score <3 vs ≥3 and score <5 vs ≥5). The total number of desaturation events on postoperative day 1 was greater than that on day 0 (32.8 ± 42.7 vs 4.1 ± 10.0, P < 0.0001). The total number of desaturation events correlated with length of hospital stay (r = 0.329, P = 0.0001). Patients with a preoperative serum CO2 of 30 mmol/L or greater had significantly longer episodes of desaturation on postoperative day 0 compared with CO2 of less than 30 mmol/L (233.7 ± 410.1 vs 82.0 ± 126.2 seconds, P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS A high preoperative value of CO2 should be a warning for possible prolonged episodes of desaturation postoperatively. An attempt to limit postoperative desaturation events should be made to minimize length of stay.","Jules-Elysée, Kethy M; Desai, Natasha A; Ma, Yan; Zhang, Wei; Luu, Thuyvan H; Memtsoudis, Stavros G; Liguori, Gregory A",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/aap.0000000000000666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206803/,333

We conducted a systematic review to assess whether there is an association between exposure to antibiotics and subsequent risk of community-acquired infections. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science for studies published before 30 June 2017, examining the association between antibiotic use and subsequent community-acquired infection. Infections caused by Clostridium difficile and fungal organisms were excluded. Studies focusing exclusively on resistant organism infections were also excluded. Results Eighteen of 22588 retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria. From these, 16 studies reported a statistically significant association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent risk of community-acquired infection. Infections associated with prior antibiotic use included Campylobacter jejuni infection (one study), recurrent furunculosis (one study), invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b infection (one study), infectious mastitis (one study), meningitis (one study), invasive pneumococcal disease (one study), Staphylococcus aureus skin infection (one study), typhoid fever (two studies), recurrent boils and abscesses (one study), upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection (one study) and Salmonella infection (five studies), although in three studies on Salmonella infection the effect was of marginal statistical significance. Conclusions We found an association between prior antibiotic use and subsequent risk of a diverse range of community-acquired infections. Gastrointestinal and skin and soft tissue infections were most frequently found to be associated with prior antibiotic exposure. Our findings support the hypothesis that antibiotic use may predispose to future infection risk, including infections caused by both antibiotic-resistant and non-resistant organisms.","Malik, Umer; Armstrong, David; Ashworth, Mark; Dregan, Alex; L'Esperance, Veline; McDonnell, Lucy; Molokhia, Mariam; White, Patrick",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkx374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29149266/,333

Yolk sac erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMP) contribute substantially to adventitial macrophages and give rise to a defined cluster of resident immune cells with homeostatic functions that is stable in adult mice, but declines in numbers during ageing and is not replenished by bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages. In response to AngII inflammation, increase in adventitial macrophages is driven by recruitment of BM monocytes, while EMP-derived macrophages proliferate locally and provide a distinct transcriptional response that is linked to tissue regeneration.

In March 2017, the Turlock branch of the California Animal Health and Food Safety laboratory system encountered an unusual clinical and pathologic presentation of infectious coryza in 6 live, 29-d-old, commercial broiler chickens that were submitted for diagnostic investigation. Antemortem evaluation revealed severe neurologic signs, including disorientation, torticollis, and opisthotonos. Swollen head-like syndrome and sinusitis were also present. Histologically, severe sinusitis, cranial osteomyelitis, otitis media and interna, and meningoencephalitis were noted, explaining the clinical signs described. A. paragallinarum was readily isolated from the upper and lower respiratory tract, brain, and cranial bones. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was also detected by PCR, and IBV was isolated in embryonated chicken eggs. Based on sequencing analysis, the IBV appeared 99% homologous to strain CA1737. A synergistic effect between A. paragallinarum and IBV, resulting in exacerbation of clinical signs and increased mortality, may have occurred in this case. A. paragallinarum should be considered among the possible causes of neurologic signs in chickens. Appropriate media should be used for bacterial isolation, and the role of additional contributing factors and/or complicating agents should be investigated in cases of infectious coryza.","Crispo, Manuela; Sentíes-Cué, C Gabriel; Cooper, George L; Mountainspring, Grace; Corsiglia, Charles; Bickford, Arthur A; Stoute, Simone T","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638718792964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30129392/,333

METHODS A retrospective review of patients who underwent LLR from 2006 to 2014 at our institution was performed. To explore the evolution of LLR, the study was divided into three equal consecutive time periods (Period 1: 2006-2008, Period 2: 2009-2011, and Period 3: 2012-2014). RESULTS Among 195 patients who underwent LLR, 24 (12.3%) required open conversions, 68 (34.9%) had resection of tumours in the difficult posterosuperior segments and 12 (6.2%) underwent major (≥ 3 segments) hepatectomies. Median operation time was 210 (range 40-620) minutes and median postoperative stay was 4 (range 1-26) days. Major postoperative morbidity (> Grade II) occurred in 11 (5.6%) patients and 90-day/in-hospital mortality was 1 (0.5%). During the study, the number of LLRs performed showed an increasing trend (Period 1: n = 22; Period 2: n = 19; Period 3: n = 154). Other statistically significant trends were: (a) increase in malignant neoplasms resected; (b) increase in resections of difficult posterosuperior segments; (c) longer median operation time; and (d) decrease in open conversion rates. CONCLUSION Over the study period, the number of LLRs increased rapidly. LLR was increasingly performed for malignant neoplasms and lesions located in the difficult posterosuperior segments, resulting in longer operation times. However, open conversion rates decreased, and there was no change in postoperative morbidity and other perioperative outcomes.","Goh, Brian Kp; Teo, Jin-Yao; Chan, Chung-Yip; Lee, Ser-Yee; Cheow, Peng-Chung; Chow, Pierce Kh; Ooi, London Lpj; Chung, Alexander Yf",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2016188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27957584/,333
129751,Risk factors of multidrug-resistant bacteria in community-acquired urinary tract infections.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are rare and occur most frequently in young women. They have an uncertain pathogenesis and unclear clinical behavior. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical presentation of solid pseudopapillary tumors and assess the efficacy of treatment with minimally invasive surgery. METHODS From March 1997 to February 2011, 13 of 273 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedures on the pancreas were found to have solid pseudopapillary tumors. There were 12 female patients and 1 male patient. The median age was 21 years (range, 15-77 years). Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom (n=9). Tumors were incidentally found in 3 patients on computed tomography scans obtained for other reasons. RESULTS Enucleation of the tumor was performed in 4 patients, including 3 in whom the tumor was located in the head of the pancreas. Eight patients underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, whereas spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed in one case. The median tumor size was 6 cm (range, 1.5-11 cm), the median operative time was 197 minutes (range, 68-320 minutes), and the median blood loss was 50 mL (range, <50-750 mL). Distal resections were performed with a linear stapler. Four patients had postoperative complications. The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (range, 2-12 days). During a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 3-121 months), no local recurrences or distant metastases were found. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic resections and enucleations of solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas can be performed safely and with adequate resection margins even if the tumors are located in the head of the organ.","Afridi, Shabbir A; Kazaryan, Airazat M; Marangos, Irina Pavlik; Røsok, Bård I; Fretland, Åsmund A; Yaqub, Sheraz; Edwin, Bjørn",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13753907291837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24960486/,333

Besides ramping up capacity and adapting operations quickly to handle the patient surge, NYC H+H had to find new ways to provide emotional and psychological support for patients, families, and staff. To help families keep in touch, dedicated staff provided daily updates by phone and used tablets for virtual visits. An expanded palliative care team held virtual consultations with families to discuss advance care planning and end-of-life decisions. Bereavement hotlines were set up for families who lost loved ones. Enhanced staff support included one-one-one and group sessions with behavioral health specialists, a behavioral health hotline, a webinar series, respite rooms, as well as complimentary lodging and child care. NYC H+H created new rituals to celebrate recoveries and mourn losses. As regular operations resume, NYC H+H plans to sustain and build upon emotional and psychological support initiatives developed during the surge.

This systematic review is a critical synthesis of studies evaluating DTN reduction strategies. METHOD Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, ProQuest dissertations and LILACS were used as bibliographic databases for primary literature. CIHI, Health Quality Council of Alberta, Health Quality Ontario and websites of heart and stroke associations in Canada, USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand were used as sources of grey literature. Searched reports were screened by title and abstract, and full texts were located for review. Articles quality was evaluated using National Institute of Health's Study Quality Assessment tools. Methods for improving DTN were categorised under 13 DTN reduction strategies, primarily adapted from the Target: Stroke Phase II recommendations, and including two additional categories: Strategies not encompassed by any Target: Stroke recommendation, and Combinations of Interventions. RESULTS 96 studies (4 randomised control trials, 1 review, 91 observational pre/post studies) were included in the review. All strategies and interventions resulted in a reduction of DTN. Approaches using combinations of interventions were the most effective at reducing DTN (33.77% DTN reduction, standard mean difference=1.857, 95% CI=1.510-2.205), and were more effective than approaches using only a single strategy (p=0.040). DTN reduction was associated with the duration of the DTN reduction programme at each facility (p=0.006). INTERPRETATION The greatest reductions in DTN were observed when implementing combinations of DTN reduction strategies, although there was no significant advantage to implementing more than two strategies simultaneously.

There are no standard techniques for correcting many of these deformities, and several different techniques are described in literature. Stahl ear is one such anomaly, characterized by an accessory third crus in the ear cartilage, giving rise to an irregular helical rim. The conventional techniques of correcting this deformity include either excision of the cartilage, repositioning of the cartilage, or scoring techniques. We recently encountered a case of Stahl ear deformity and undertook correction using internal sutures with very good results.

Evidence is growing for a role of AL in viral infection. AL have been observed early in the life cycles of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting a specific induction of mechanisms potentially useful to these pathogens. Like other positive-strand RNA viruses, these viruses induce host cells membranes rearrangements. The NPCs of AL could potentially mediate exchanges between these partially sealed compartments and the cytoplasm. AL may also be involved in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis or cell cycle control. They were recently observed in cells infected with Theileria annulata, an intracellular protozoan parasite inducing cell proliferation.

Developing potent radiosensitizers is therefore critical for improving outcomes. The use of drugs that have already undergone clinical testing is an appealing approach once the side effects and tolerated doses are established. Here, we demonstrate that the aminopeptidase inhibitor, CHR-2797/tosedostat, increases the radiosensitivity of esophageal cancer cell lines (FLO-1 and OE21) in vitro in both normoxic and physiologically relevant low oxygen conditions. To our knowledge, the effective combination of CHR-2797 with radiation exposure has not been reported previously in any cancer cell type. The mechanism of increased radiosensitivity was not dependent on the induction of DNA damage or DNA repair kinetics. Our data support the need for further preclinical testing of CHR-2797 in combination with radiotherapy for the treatment of esophageal cancer.","Anbalagan, Selvakumar; Biasoli, Deborah; Leszczynska, Katarzyna B; Mukherjee, Somnath; Hammond, Ester M",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rr14150.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26291737/,333

In this work, we present for the first time a variational multi-task framework that allows joining three relevant tasks in MRI: reconstruction, registration and super-resolution. Our framework takes a set of multiple undersampled MR acquisitions corrupted by motion into a novel multi-task optimisation model, which is composed of an L2 fidelity term that allows sharing representation between tasks, super-resolution foundations and hyperelastic deformations to model biological tissue behaviors. We demonstrate that this combination yields significant improvements over sequential models and other bi-task methods. Our results exhibit fine details and compensate for motion producing sharp and highly textured images compared to state of the art methods while keeping low CPU time.

137434,"Telemedicine Yes, But No Telepathy.",2020-09-01,"Overactivation of neuroimmune signaling has been linked to excessive ethanol consumption. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major component of innate immune signaling and initiate anti- and pro-inflammatory responses via intracellular signal transduction cascades. TLR7 is upregulated in post-mortem brain tissue from humans with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and animals with prior exposure to ethanol. Despite this evidence, the role of TLR7 in the regulation of voluntary ethanol consumption has not been studied. We test the hypothesis that TLR7 activation regulates voluntary ethanol drinking behavior by administering a TLR7 agonist (R848) during an intermittent access drinking procedure in mice. Acute activation of TLR7 reduced ethanol intake, preference, and total fluid intake due, at least in part, to an acute sickness response. However, chronic pre-treatment with R848 resulted in tolerance to the adverse effects of the drug and a subsequent increase in ethanol consumption. To determine the molecular machinery that mediates these behavioral changes, we evaluated gene expression after acute and chronic TLR7 activation. We found that acute TLR7 activation produces brain region specific changes in expression of immune pathway genes, whereas chronic TLR7 activation causes downregulation of TLRs and blunted cytokine induction, suggesting molecular tolerance. Our results demonstrate a novel role for TLR7 signaling in regulating voluntary ethanol consumption. Taken together, our findings suggest TLR7 may be a viable target for development of therapies to treat AUD.","Grantham, E K; Warden, A S; McCarthy, G S; DaCosta, A; Mason, S; Blednov, Y; Mayfield, R D; Harris, R A","Brain, behavior, and immunity",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726684/,333

The secondary objective was to determine the characteristics of LUS manifestations in different subgroups of ICU patients. METHODS This prospective multi-center cohort study was conducted in 17 ICUs. A total of 1702 patients admitted between August 31, 2017 and February 16, 2019 were included. LUS was performed according to the bedside lung ultrasound in emergency (BLUE)-plus protocol, and LUS scores were calculated. Data on the outcomes and oxygenation indices were analyzed and compared between different primary indication groups. RESULTS The LUS scores were significantly higher for non-survivors than for survivors and were significantly different between the oxygenation index groups, with higher scores in the lower oxygenation index groups. The LUS score was an independent risk factor for the 28-day mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.663 for prediction of the 28-day mortality and 0.748 for prediction of an oxygenation index ≤100.

Health regulations indicate a limit up to 160 µg/kg for OA/DTXs, PTXs or AZAs, and 3.75 mg/kg for YTXs.Argopecten purpuratus is one of the most important commercial marine products exploited in Perú. Despite its importance and the periodic reports of the presence of HABs in Peruvian coastal waters, the lack of information regarding potential contamination by LMTs is noteworthy.In this work, we report a study performed with 115 samples of A. purpuratus collected between November 2013 and March 2015 from 18 scallop production areas distributed along the Peruvian coast in search of LMTs. To magnify positive results, the hepatopancreas tissue was analyzed by an LC-MS/MS method implemented to quantify OA, YTX, AZA-1, and PTX-2. Baseline separation was achieved in 19 min. The method showed satisfactory linearity (R 2 > 0.997), precision (coefficient of variation < 15 %), and limit of quantification (0.155-0.479 ng/mL). The study revealed the presence of YTX in 72 samples and of PTX-2 in 17 samples, with both biotoxins found at concentrations below the regulatory limits. Free OA and AZA-1 were not detected in any scallop sample. This atypical profile, presence of PTX-2 in the absence of OA, has been previously reported and may be linked to presence of the dinoflagellate D. acuminata . The production of YTX could be associated to the phytoplankton G. spinifera and P. reticulatum .This is the first systematic assessment of the four groups of LMTs in shellfish from Peruvian coastal waters. The results attained suggest low prevalence of marine biotoxins in Peruvian bay scallops yet support the necessity of future surveillance and analysis of LMTs in Perú.","Leyva, Vanessa; Maruenda, Helena",Journal of food protection,https://doi.org/10.4315/jfp-20-212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977333/,333

142256,Patient navigation in epilepsy care.,2020-11-21,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of nursing supply flows, domestically and internationally. Its impact at the country-level has further highlighted preexisting nurse supply gaps and the effect of staffing shortages. Internationally, the pandemic has disrupted global supply chains. The world has witnessed the closing of borders, the interruption of travel, and, in some countries, the restriction of outflows. The State of the World's Nursing Report (SOWN) (WHO, 2020) noted a shortfall of almost six million nurses immediately pre-COVID-19, a shortage suffered particularly by low- and middle-income countries. This is of major concern given that increased international outflows of nurses in the new post-COVID era could undermine, even more than before, the readiness of those countries to meet healthcare demands (ICN, 2020). In this default scenario, some, but not all, highincome destination countries will continue to rely on international inflow of nurses to a significant extent, as they did pre-COVID- 19, further exacerbating the suffering of poor countries. Put simply, without country-level policy changes related to the nursing workforce and backed by international organisations, pre-COVID-19 trends of increased nurse flows from low- to high-income countries will likely continue. In this scenario, the iniquitous maldistribution of nurses may become more pronounced. This ""do nothing"" option risks undermining both country-level progress towards the attainment of Universal Health.","Shaffer, Franklin A; Rocco, Gennaro; Stievano, Alessandro",Professioni infermieristiche,https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2020.733129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355771/,333
143131,"USS Theodore Roosevelt, COVID-19, and Ships: Lessons Learned.",2020-10-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRNT) is characterized by systemic administration of radiolabelled drugs, targeting specific molecular alterations expressed on the tumour cells. Small molecules, labelled with β- or α- emitting radioisotopes, are used to deliver radiation directly to the tumour sites. Pretreatment imaging to visualize whole body biodistribution of the target, using the same drugs labelled with positron or γ-emitting radionuclides, completes the concept of theranostic. This review will briefly summarize the current clinical research findings and applications of TRNT in solid tumours, mostly focusing on neuroendocrine and prostate neoplasms. RECENT FINDINGS Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is a major component in the management of gastroentropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, with favourable safety profile, quality-of-life improvement and survival benefit. On the NETTER-1 study, it proved to be more effective than high-dose long-acting-release octreotide, leading to its regulatory approval. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an excellent target for TRNT in prostate cancer. 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy demonstrated higher response rates in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, when compared with second-line chemotherapy. New developments, including targeting of fibroblast activation proteins overexpressed in the tumour stroma, show promising preliminary results in the theranostic setting. SUMMARY Recent research has demonstrated and consolidated the use of TRNT against well established targets in neuroendocrine tumours and prostate cancer. The identification of new promising molecular targets for TRNT, will further expand the theranostic applications of radionuclides in the field of nuclear medicine.","Artigas, Carlos; Mileva, Magdalena; Flamen, Patrick; Karfis, Ioannis",Current opinion in oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0000000000000762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183491/,333
143240,Psychometric Testing of the Self-care of Hypertension Inventory Version 3.0.,2021-06-09,"PURPOSE The choice of mesh and anchoring device in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is controversial. Clinically important long-term properties of mesh and anchoring device such as mesh shrinkage have been sparsely investigated. Furthermore, the effect of various anchoring devices on mesh properties has never been examined. METHODS In 20 sheep, using laparoscopy, we inserted three PhysiomeshTM (large pore, lightweight) and three VentralightTMST (small pore, mediumweight), anchored with ProTackTM, SecurestrapTM or GlubranTM, respectively. After 6 and 12 months, 10 sheep at each time-point, we euthanized the animals, harvested the meshes with fascia, and measured the exact size and area of the mesh, expressing mesh shrinkage as a percentage of the initial area. RESULTS The shrinkage of PhysiomeshTM was 35.7 %, 23.8 % and 17.7 % when anchored with ProtackTM, GlubranTM or SecurestrapTM, respectively. Shrinkage with ProtackTM was significantly higher than with either GlubranTM or SecurestrapTM, respectively (p<0.01 and p<0.01). The shrinkage of VentralightTMST was 19.3 %, 22.2 % and 19.6 % when anchored with ProtackTM, GlubranTM and SecurestrapTM, respectively (p>0.05 for all pairwise comparisons). Overall shrinkage of PhysiomeshTM anchored with ProtackTM was significantly higher for all comparisons (p<0.01). CONCLUSION Our results suggest that mesh shrinkage in sheep takes place within 6 months after implantation. A significant interaction between mesh and type of anchoring indicates that shrinkage may depend on both mesh properties and anchoring device. The results of the current study imply that the combined effect of mesh and anchoring device should be evaluated in future studies.","Harsløf, S; Zinther, N; Harsløf, T; Danielsen, C; Wara, P; Friis-Andersen, H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-016-1528-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515807/,333

Neither antivirals nor vaccines are available at present. We previously demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies specific for SFTSV glycoprotein (Gn) played a vital role in the survival of patients with SFTS. Nanobodies from camels present unique properties, such as thermostability, high affinity, and low immunogenicity. In the current study, mammalian expressed SFTSV Gn was used to immunize a camel, and functional nanobodies were isolated from the B cell nanobody library constructed from the immunized animal. Clone SNB02 was selected for in-depth analysis for its inhibition of SFTSV replication both in vitro and in vivo.

A preliminary study was carried out with two experimental intact male horses and subsequently the procedure was performed in two clinical cases. These horse owners want to keep their animals in the most possible natural way, preserving its stallion behaviour in a herd without generating offspring. The horses were sedated and restrained in stocks and laparoscopic vasectomy was performed using three portal sites in both paralumbar fossae recording surgical times. A 4-cm segment of each ductus deferens (DD) was occluded with laparoscopic vessel sealing devices and subsequently excised. Semen collection was performed using an artificial vagina before the laparoscopic procedure and at 15 and 60 days postoperatively. Sexual behaviour and spermiogram were analysed. Two months after vasectomy, control laparoscopy was performed in experimental horses to assess the surgical site. Bilateral vasectomy could be performed without intraoperative complications in a mean surgical time of 20 min per DD. Success of the procedure was confirmed in all cases by azoospermic ejaculates 60 days after vasectomy.

We aimed to study the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) relationship before, during, and after chest trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation in swine. Twenty-four swine were intubated, anesthetized, and monitored in an animal intensive care unit during three phases: phase 1 (day 1, healthy animals); phase 2 (day 2, injury), which consisted of blunt chest trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation; and phase 3 (day 2, after injury). ""Respiratory maneuvers"" (changes in respiratory rate and tidal volume [TV], intended to vary the PaCO(2) over a range of 25 to 85 mmHg, were performed during phases 1 and 3. End-tidal CO(2) and PaCO(2) were recorded after each respiratory maneuver and analyzed using linear regression. During phase 1, PaCO(2) and EtCO(2) were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.01). During phase 2, animals developed decreased oxygenation (PaO(2):FiO(2) [fraction of inspired oxygen] ratio <200) and hypotension (mean arterial pressure, 20-50 mmHg); the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) relationship deteriorated (r(2) = 0.25, P < 0.0001). During phase 3, oxygenation, hemodynamics, and the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) relationship recovered (r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.01). End-tidal CO(2) closely correlates to PaCO(2) in healthy animals and after injury/resuscitation across a wide range of respiratory rates and tidal volumes. Once oxygenation and hemodynamics are restored, EtCO(2) can be used to predict PaCO(2) following chest trauma/hemorrhage and should be considered for patient monitoring. This work demonstrated that EtCO(2) alone can reliably be used to estimate PaCO(2) in uninjured subjects and in those subjects who have been resuscitated from severe injury. Immediately after blunt chest injury, the correlation between EtCO(2) and PaCO(2) is temporarily unstable. Under these circumstances (with abnormal oxygenation and/or hemodynamics), greater caution and other monitoring tools may be required.","Isbell, Claire Larson; Batchinsky, Andriy I; Hetz, Katherine M; Baker, William L; Cancio, Leopoldo C",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0b013e3182391862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21993447/,333

Using both the disk diffusion test and checkerboard assay, we initially examined the effects of combinations of retapamulin with MLS antibiotics against standard strains of these species. Combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and quinupristin showed synergistic activity against E. faecalis only. Synergy of retapamulin with clindamycin and dalfopristin was not observed. Then, a checkerboard assay was performed to evaluate the effects of the combinations against 15 clinical strains of E. faecalis. Retapamulin and quinupristin, the most synergistic combination, showed activity against all erythromycin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant strains tested. Among the eight strains with high-level erythromycin resistance, five strains were synergistically inhibited in the presence of only 1 μg of retapamulin per ml. Time-kill assay revealed that combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin and quinupristin were bacteriostatic.

Given the intertwined relationships between patients and family caregivers, their interdependence should be considered to understand how perceived spiritual needs affect the quality of life of their own and of their partner. This study used the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model as the conceptual model to investigate the mutual effects of perceived spiritual needs on the quality of life in patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers after being admitted to hospice. This cross-sectional study used the baseline data of a large clinical trial and identified that patients with cancer and their family caregivers perceived similar spiritual needs associated with the community and outlook needs and had fewer unmet spiritual needs. After controlling for partner effects, perceived outlook needs shown in patients significantly predicted their own functional well-being and social/spiritual well-being. Outlook and community needs perceived by family caregivers also significantly predicted their own mental health. Although partner effects were not shown as expected, the findings provide insight into the mutuality of spirituality and demonstrate the necessity of providing timely and ongoing spiritual assessment and care.","Huang, Li-Ting; Tai, Chun-Yi; Longcoy, Joshua; McMillan, Susan C",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185726/,333

HYPOTHESIS The use of a single tibial tunnel arthroscopic technique without bone plugs will reduce symptoms (pain) and improve knee function at a minimum 3-year follow-up. STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS Thirty-two meniscal transplantations (16 medial, 16 lateral; 23 men, 9 women) were prospectively evaluated at a minimum of 36 months (mean, 40.4 ± 6.90 months; range, 36-66 months) after surgery. The average age at the time of surgery was 35.6 ± 10.3 years (range, 15-55 years). The transplantation was performed using an arthroscopic bone plug-free technique with a single tibial tunnel plus ""all-inside"" meniscal sutures. The anterior meniscal horn was sutured to the capsule. Follow-up included a visual analog scale (VAS) score for knee pain and subjective and objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Lysholm, Tegner, and SF-36 scores. All patients underwent radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of the involved knee before the surgery and at the final follow-up. The MRI outcomes were evaluated with the modified Yulish score. RESULTS Regarding clinical evaluation, there was a significant improvement in scores at follow-up compared with preoperatively: the VAS score decreased from 70.6 ± 21.7 to 25.2 ± 22.7 (P < .0001), the SF-36 physical component score increased from 37.31 ± 7.2 to 49.69 ± 8.3 (P < .0001), the SF-36 mental component score increased from 49.69 ± 10.8 to 53.53 ± 7.5 (P = .0032), the Tegner activity score increased from 3 (range, 3-5) to 5 (range, 3-6) (P < .0121), the Lysholm score increased from 59.78 ± 18.25 to 84.84 ± 14.4 (P < .0001), the subjective IKDC score increased from 47.44 ± 20.60 to 77.20 ± 15.57 (P < .0001), and the objective IKDC score changed from 1 A, 21 B, 6 C, and 4 D to 22 A, 9 B, and 1 C (P < .0001). No significant difference was found in this study between patients who received medial allografts and patients who received lateral allografts. There was no significant difference between outcomes of patients with isolated and combined procedures. The MRI findings showed 69% extruded allografts (8 medial and 14 lateral). In detail, we found 50% of the medial allografts and 87% of the lateral allografts extruded. No significant difference in clinical outcomes and modified Yulish score was found between patients with extruded allografts and with in situ allografts. The MRI results also showed a significant decrease of the modified Yulish score from baseline to 3-year minimum follow-up (P < .0001 for femur and P < .0001 for tibia). Only one patient underwent arthroscopic selective meniscectomy because of a medial posterior horn retear of the graft. One patient developed lack of flexion and underwent an arthroscopic arthrolysis. These 2 patients did not draw benefit from allografting and therefore were considered failures. In all remaining cases (94%), meniscal allograft transplantation was able to reduce symptoms (pain measured by VAS) and improve knee function (as measured by IKDC and Lysholm scores). CONCLUSION This study found that a single tibial tunnel arthroscopic technique without bone plugs for meniscal allograft transplantation significantly reduced pain and improved knee function in 94% of patients at a minimum 3-year follow-up.","Marcacci, Maurilio; Zaffagnini, Stefano; Marcheggiani Muccioli, Giulio Maria; Grassi, Alberto; Bonanzinga, Tommaso; Nitri, Marco; Bondi, Alice; Molinari, Massimo; Rimondi, Eugenio",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546511424688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22056296/,333

METHODS From a prospective database, all patients operated between 2010 and 2014 received IPC in addition to LMWH and were compared to a historical cohort of patients treated LMWH only (2004-2009). RESULTS Of the 313 included patients, 195 (62%) received IPC. Patients with IPC received neoadjuvant chemoradiation more often (45% vs. 3%, P < 0.001), whereas, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was equally distributed (31% vs. 34%, P = 0.631). There were no differences with regard to surgical approach, operative time, blood loss, and ICU stay. Patients treated without IPC had a longer hospital stay (18 vs. 15 days, P = 0.014). Overall, 12 clinical VTE's occurred in 11 patients, which consisted of two deep venous thromboses and 10 pulmonary embolisms. In the group of patients, who received IPC 1.5% developed a symptomatic VTE compared to 6.8% in patients without IPC (OR = 0.215; 95% CI = 0.06-0.83).

The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with the quality of perceived patient-physician communication and whether this variable was associated with increased odds of vaccination. METHODS We used cross-sectional data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study conducted from October 2016 to January 2017. The participants were 22,253 physically and cognitively independent individuals aged 65 or older living in 39 municipalities in Japan. Multilevel logit models were used to estimate the odds of vaccination. RESULTS Among the participants, 40.0% and 58.8% had received pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations as per the recommended schedule, respectively. People with low educational levels were more likely to have a family physician but rate their experience in asking questions lower than those with higher educational levels. Having a family physician and high rating for physicians' listening attitude were positively associated with increased odds of pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations. High rating for patients' questioning attitude and shared decision-making, compared to an ambiguous attitude toward medical decision-making, were positively associated with increased odds of pneumococcal vaccination. CONCLUSION The results suggest that promotion of having a family physician, better patient-physician communication, and shared decision-making may encourage older adults to undergo recommended vaccinations.","Sato, Koryu; Kondo, Naoki; Murata, Chiyoe; Shobugawa, Yugo; Saito, Kousuke; Kondo, Katsunori",Journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.je20200505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551389/,333

In a few of the studies, surgical site infection (SSI) rates are mentioned and none of the studies emphasize the effect of decreased surgical time on postoperative cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. In this study, the authors compared the PCF rates, SSI rates, operation times between 30 mechanical stapler and 40 manual esophageal closure during total laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer patients. National Nasocomial Infections Surveillance system (NNISS) scores were recorded and compared between groups. Total laryngectomy and total operation times were lower in the stapler group patients (P < 0.001 for total laryngectomy time, P = 0.024 for total operation time). There were lower rates of pharyngocutaneous fistula (P = 0.032), surgical site infection (P = 0.019), and NNISS scores (P = 0.009) in the stapler group. There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding postoperative systemic complications (P = 0.451). In conclusion, stapler esophageal closure decreases operation time, PCF, SSI rates, and NNISS scores but not the systemic complication rates. Comorbid illnesses and prolonged surgical time are risk factors for postoperative systemic complications in total laryngectomy patients, but patients with additional illnesses must not encourage the surgeon to use stapler for decreasing postoperative systemic complications.","Ismi, Onur; Unal, Murat; Vayisoglu, Yusuf; Yesilova, Mesut; Helvaci, Ilter; Gorur, Kemal; Ozcan, Cengiz",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000003196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893554/,333

However, the association of obesity with biomechanical alterations of walking in the early stages of life have not yet been systematically reviewed. Thus, this review aims to summarize the biomechanical characteristics of walking in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity (OW/OB) versus their normal-weight (NW) counterparts. PubMed and Web of Science were systematically searched until November 2018. We found strong and moderate evidence supporting biomechanical differences in the gait pattern of OW/OB with respect to NW. Based on strong evidence, the gait patterns of OW/OB present greater pelvis transversal plane motion, higher hip internal rotation, higher hip flexion, extension and abduction moments and power generation/absorption, greater knee abduction/adduction motion, and higher knee abduction/adduction moments and power generation/absorption. Based on moderate evidence, OW/OB walk with greater step width, longer stance phase, higher tibiofemoral contact forces, higher ankle plantarflexion moments and power generation, and greater gastrocnemius and soleus activation/forces. These biomechanical alterations during walking in OW/OB could play a major role in the onset and progression of MSKD.","Molina-Garcia, Pablo; Migueles, Jairo H; Cadenas-Sanchez, Cristina; Esteban-Cornejo, Irene; Mora-Gonzalez, Jose; Rodriguez-Ayllon, Maria; Plaza-Florido, Abel; Vanrenterghem, Jos; Ortega, Francisco B",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30942558/,333

METHODS We conducted two workshops in which participants were immersed in the speculative scenario of an interplanetary mission in which health problems emerged that required medical trials to resolve. The workshops used virtual reality and live simulation to mimic a zero-gravity environment and visual perception shifts and were followed by group discussion. RESULTS Some key aspects for the framework that emerged from the workshops included: (a) approaches to be inclusive in the management of the trial, (b) approaches to be inclusive in designing the research project (patient preference trials, n-of-1 trials, designing clinical trials to be part of a future prospective meta-analysis, etc), (c) balancing the research needs and the community needs (eg, allocation of the participants based on both research and community need), (d) ethics and partnerships (ethics and consent issues and how they relate to partnerships and relationships). CONCLUSION In identifying some key areas that need to be incorporated in future planning of clinical trials for interplanetary missions, we also identified areas that are relevant to engaging patients in clinical trials on Earth. We will suggest using the same methodology to facilitate more in-depth discussions on specific aspects of clinical trials in aerospace medicine. The methodology can be more widely used in other areas to open new inclusive conversations around innovating research methodology.","Nasser, Mona; Peres, Nicholas; Knight, Jacqui; Haines, Agatha; Young, Charlie; Maranan, Diego; Wright, Julian; Carvil, Philip; Robinson, Karen; Westmore, Matthew; Griffin, Joanna; Halkes, Matthew",Journal of evidence-based medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449984/,333

Animal model was established, and lung tissue histopathologic status and permeability were detected by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) or Evans blue dye assay respectively. Levels of inflammation cytokines, lncRNA TUG1, miR-221-3p, sprouty related EVH1 domain-containing 2 (SPRED2), and phosphorylated (p)-ERK1/2 were determined by ELISA, qRT-PCR or Western blot. Pulmonary impairment and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. We observed that LPS up-regulated levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-1β (1L-1β), and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and reduced SPRED2 levels, which were rescued by overexpressed lncRNA TUG1. StarBase and dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that miR-221-3p was targeted by lncRNA TUG1. MiR-221-3p could reverse the effect of lncRNA TUG1 on cell apoptosis, levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, SPRED2, and p-ERK1/2. Therefore, overexpressed lncRNA TUG1 attenuated LPS-induced pulmonary impairment in ARDS mice via regulating miR-221-3p/SPRED2 axis.","Hu, Lili; Ye, Hongwei; Liao, Jianjun","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",https://doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2020.1806704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841583/,333

Failure of the first OXPHOS enzyme complex, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase or complex I (CI), is associated with multiple signs and symptoms presenting at variable ages of onset. There is no approved drug treatment yet to slow or reverse the progression of CI-deficient disorders. Here, we present a comprehensive human metabolic network model of genetically characterized CI-deficient patient-derived fibroblasts. Model calculations predicted that increased cholesterol production, export, and utilization can counterbalance the surplus of reducing equivalents in patient-derived fibroblasts, as these pathways consume considerable amounts of NAD(P)H. We show that fibrates attenuated increased NAD(P)H levels and improved CI-deficient fibroblast growth by stimulating the production of cholesterol via enhancement of its cellular efflux. In CI-deficient (Ndufs4-/-) mice, fibrate treatment resulted in prolonged survival and improved motor function, which was accompanied by an increased cholesterol efflux from peritoneal macrophages. Our results shine a new light on the use of compensatory biological pathways in mitochondrial dysfunction which may lead to novel therapeutic interventions for mitochondrial diseases for which currently no cure exists.","Schirris, Tom J J; Rossell, Sergio; de Haas, Ria; Frambach, Sanne J C M; Hoogstraten, Charlotte A; Renkema, G Herma; Beyrath, Julien D; Willems, Peter H G M; Huynen, Martijn A; Smeitink, Jan A M; Russel, Frans G M; Notebaart, Richard A",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

160453,Epileptologists telling their experiences caring for patients with epilepsy.,2020-12-26,"BACKGROUND In the past decade, several new surgical tools have revived the hope for an improved technique to treat radically hemorrhoids with less postoperative pain. Among these radiofrequency (RF), excisional surgery seems to be safe, fast, and accompanied by less postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare RF (ligasure TM) to conventional diathermy Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy (MMH). PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2003 and July 2009, 210 symptomatic patients were randomized to undergo RF (118 patients) or diathermy MMH (92 patients). Mean follow-up was 39 ± 16 months. Clinical outcome was assessed by validated questionnaire on postoperative symptoms and satisfaction. Primary endpoints were pain and wound healing. Secondary endpoints were operative time, early and late complications (including recurrences), and patient satisfaction. Data was analyzed using chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Despite postoperative pain was less after RF, this difference was significant only for severe pain (expressed as VAS score >7). Significant differences were observed in terms of wound healing. The two techniques were similar in terms of early and late complications. CONCLUSIONS RF hemorrhoidectomy is followed by reduced severe pain and better wound healing. However, in our experience, this is not followed by earlier return to daily activities.","Franceschilli, Luana; Stolfi, Vito M; D' Ugo, Stefano; Angelucci, Giulio P; Lazzaro, Sara; Picone, Emanuele; Gaspari, Achille; Sileri, Pierpaolo",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-011-1216-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21519801/,333

Despite these interventions, confirmed COVID-19 infection rates have been high in the United Kingdom. Prevalence of asymptomatic disease in an adult hemodialysis population has not been reported. Also, to our knowledge, the development of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been previously reported in this population. Although serologic testing does not provide information on the infectivity of patients, seroprevalence studies may enable investigation of exposure within dialysis units and hence, assessment of current screening strategies. METHODS To investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a hemodialysis population, we used the Abbott IgG assay with the Architect system to test serum samples from 356 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS Of 356 patients, 121 had been symptomatic when screened before a dialysis session and received an RT-PCR test; 79 (22.2% of the total study population) tested positive for COVID-19. Serologic testing of all 356 patients found 129 (36.2%) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Only two patients with PCR-confirmed infection did not seroconvert. Of the 129 patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 52 (40.3%) had asymptomatic disease or undetected disease by PCR testing alone. CONCLUSIONS We found a high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. Serologic evidence of previous infection in asymptomatic or PCR-negative patients suggests that current diagnostic screening strategies may be limited in their ability to detect acute infection.","Clarke, Candice; Prendecki, Maria; Dhutia, Amrita; Ali, Mahrukh A; Sajjad, Hira; Shivakumar, Oshini; Lightstone, Liz; Kelleher, Peter; Pickering, Matthew C; Thomas, David; Charif, Rawya; Griffith, Megan; McAdoo, Stephen P; Willicombe, Michelle",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020060827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732391/,333

General practice registrars are responsible for a significant proportion of immunisations in this age group and are also in the process of developing patterns of practice. Despite their role, little is known about general practice registrars' attitudes towards immunisation of older adults, the barriers faced, and the role supervisors play in developing adult immunisation skills. METHOD This was a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with general practice registrars and supervisors purposively sampled from around Australia. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS The five key themes were grouped in terms of perceptions of registrars' role in immunisation of older adults, consultation barriers, health system barriers, managing vaccine hesitancy, and a team approach to vaccination. DISCUSSION Vaccine positivity is an important attitude to cultivate within the general practice environment as it has an impact on registrar behaviour. Immunisation-skilled nurses could play a role in training general practice registrars in immunisation.

We present a clinical-pathological correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis. Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intraalveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphological alterations suspicious for viral cytopathic effect. However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation. This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.","Yan, Lei; Mir, Mahnoor; Sanchez, Paloma; Beg, Moeezullah; Peters, Jay; Enriquez, Omar; Gilbert, Andrea",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0217-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422081/,333

Experience from a Tertiary Care Hospital in South India,2021,"Introduction: Radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 has shifted from the use of routine chest X-rays (CXRs) early on during the pandemic to high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest to accurately describe the pattern of COVID involvement of the lungs. The morphological patterns seen at HRCT are increasingly being tapped into by a clinician in the management of this uncharted territory, for example, HRCT lung findings are categorized into three distinct phenotypes by an intensivist for guiding advanced ventilatory management of COVID patients. However, in resource-limited settings, HRCT places a heavy burden on the radiology departments and poses an enormous challenge to infection control in the CT suite. Our study aims to describe CXR patterns of COVID-19 acquired by portable radiography units and correlate them to symptom onset and progression in an attempt to enroll it as a reliable tool to assist clinical management including intensive unit care and ventilatory support. Methodology: Our study was a retrospective observational study of portable CXR findings in all patients diagnosed as COVID-19 positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction at a tertiary medical center from April to May 2020. Results: A total of fifty patients were included in the study, and the presence or absence of CXR findings in the presence or absence of clinical symptoms was analyzed. Our study showed that 24 (48%) patients had baseline features of lung involvement on CXR. Patients who presented with fever or breathlessness were found to be highly likely to show changes on the CXR. The most commonly noted changes were ground-glass opacities in 31 (63%) of patients with a bilateral, peripheral pattern of involvement seen in the lower zones of the lungs. Conclusion: While the higher sensitivity of the HRCT is of great clinical value, the portable CXR offers a feasible alternative to screen, follow clinical progress, and assist management of COVID-19 patients and should be considered as a means to reduce radiological service demands and reduce the risk of cross-infection.","Khandediya, O.; Narasimhan, D.; Kapoor, P.; Sinha, S.",Journal of Marine Medical Society,https://doi.org/10.4103/jmms.jmms_130_20,333

Over the years, migrants’ remittances have played an important role in the social and economic development of Albania and Albanian families. The health emergency caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to reshape our economy and could be devastating for migrants too. This pandemic is expected to change the context for international migration and potentially cause a decrease in remittances from Albanian migrants. And yet, surprisingly, there is a lack of effective mechanisms, policies, and recovery paths for increasing the positive impact of remittances on the country's development. The paper suggests that the way remittances are managed is important.

169464,The four watches: a small Island approach to COVID-19 in the emergency department,2020,"Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic called for rapid deployment of telehealth. To assess utility of telehealth in pediatric T1D, we compared CGM glucose values in youth with T1D using CGM before and during the pandemic. Methods: The EHR provided visit frequency and CGM metrics. Data during pandemic (3/16/20 to 10/29/20) were compared with data from the same calendar months in 2019. Youth (N=469) using CGM and seen in both periods were included based on pre-pandemic characteristics: age 1-18 yr, T1D duration ≥6 mo (if age <6) or ≥1 yr (if age ≥6 yr). CGM metrics included mean and SD glucose, coefficient of variation (CV), and glucose management index (GMI). Each youth's CGM data were averaged in each time period and compared in paired analyses. Results: Youth (46% male) had a mean age 12.4±3.5 yr, T1D duration 6.1±3.6 yr, HbA1c 7.8±0.9%;80% were pump-treated. Pre-pandemic, 0.1% of visits were telehealth, increasing to 99.6% during pandemic. Mean number of visits during each 7-mo period increased from 2.5 in 2019 to 2.7 in 2020 (p=.006). CGM metrics generally improved during the pandemic period (Table). Those whose visit frequency increased with telehealth had the greatest improvement in CGM glucose, from 192±72 to 183±67 (p<.001). Conclusions: Telehealth allowed increased visit frequency and improved CGM glucose metrics, supporting non-inferiority and potential benefit of telehealth for youth with T1D using CGM.","Kaushal, Tara Tinsley Liane J.; Volkening, Lisa K.; Turcotte, Christine Laffel Lori M.",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-309-or,333
171138,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviour: update of living systematic review,2020,"Background: COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide. Clinical manifestations range from severe cases with a lethal outcome to mild or asymptomatic cases. Although there is the same proportion of infected genders, men are more susceptible to severe COVID-19, with a higher risk of death than women. This sex-bias may be explained by biological pathways. Methods: We performed an epidemiological survey from July 2020 to July 2021 including 1744 unvaccinated adult Brazilian couples with at least one infected spouse despite living together during the COVID-19 infection without protective measures. The presence or absence of infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and/or serology results. The couples were divided between groups where both partners were infected (concordant couples) or only one spouse remained asymptomatic despite the close contact with the infected one (discordant couples). Statistical analysis of the collected data was performed aiming to verify a differential transmitter potential between genders in household contact. Results: The combination of our data collected from concordant and discordant couples showed that the man is the first (or the only) affected in the major occurrences when compared to women. Our findings support other published surveys and are in concordance with previous studies of our group. Conclusions: These observations support the hypothesis according to which male individuals are more efficient virus transmitters than females, independently of the use of protective masks. In short, the present study confirmed the existence of gender differences not only for susceptibility to infection and resistance to COVID-19 but also in the transmission rate.","Silva, M. V.

Little is known about landlord and tenant behaviors during the eviction moratorium. The current study used three waves of data from May 2020-April 2021 from a nationally representative sample of U.S. middle- and low-income tenants (n= 3,393 in Wave 1, n= 1,311 in Wave 2, and 814 in Wave 3) to examine tenants who were evicted during the eviction moratorium and the reported effects of the moratorium on tenant rental payments and tenant-landlord relationships. Across three Waves, 4.3% of tenants reported experiencing an eviction during the moratorium and 6-23% of tenants reported delaying paying rent because of the moratorium. Multivariable analyses found that tenants who delayed paying their rent, were female, or had a history of mental illness or substance use disorder were significantly more likely to report the eviction moratorium had a negative effect on the relationship with their landlord. Analyses also revealed that testing positive for COVID-19 was not a significant predictor of eviction but tenants with a history a homelessness were more than 9 times as likely to report an eviction than those without such a history. Together, these findings suggest the eviction moratorium has had some unintended consequences on rent payments and tenant-landlord relationships that need to be considered in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tsai, J.; Huang, M.; Blosnich, J.; Elbogen, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.27.21262736v1?rss=1,333

Contact tracing, as a pillar of communicable disease control in public health for decades, has shown its effectiveness on pandemic control. Despite intensive research on contact tracing, existing schemes are vulnerable to attacks and can hardly simultaneously meet the requirements of data integrity and user privacy. The design of a privacy-preserving contact tracing framework to ensure the integrity of the tracing procedure has not been sufficiently studied and remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose P2B-Trace, a privacy-preserving contact tracing initiative based on blockchain. First, we design a decentralized architecture with blockchain to record an authenticated data structure of the user's contact records, which prevents the user from intentionally modifying his local records afterward. Second, we develop a zero-knowledge proximity verification scheme to further verify the user's proximity claim while protecting user privacy. We implement P2B-Trace and conduct experiments to evaluate the cost of privacy-preserving tracing integrity verification. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system. © 2021 ACM.","Peng, Z.; Xu, C.; Wang, H.; Huang, J.; Xu, J.; Chu, X.","2021 International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3448016.3459237,333

Estimates of morbidity and mortality amongst homeless populations is limited due to the lack of recording of housing status across health datasets. The aim of this study is to: (1) identify a homelessness e-cohort by linking routine health data, and (2) explore whether a period of reported past homelessness, places this population at greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Methods: Homelessness identified through linkage across primary, secondary care, and substance misuse datasets in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Mortality was examined through linkage to the Office for National Statistics mortality data. Results: E-cohort of 15,472 individuals with lived experience of homelessness identified. Of those, 21 individuals died between February and July 2020 from COVID-19. Those with lived experience of homelessness had increased mortality from many causes including COVID-19, i.e. accidents, liver diseases and suicides. Conclusion: Linking multiple routine datasets provides a more comprehensive dataset of a marginalised population. Application of the cohort demonstrated that individuals with lived experience of homelessness have increased mortality from COVID-19 and other causes. The underlying reasons, health needs, and causes of death warrant further exploration.","Song, J.; Grey, C. N. B.; Davies, A. R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248252v1?rss=1,333

A human model of LF formation would provide a tool to understand LF development and an alternative to non-human primate models for preclinical evaluation of vaccines. Here, we show that primary human blood B- and T-lymphocytes autonomously assemble into ectopic LFs when cultured in a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix gel within an organ-on-a-chip microfluidic device. Dynamic fluid flow is required for LF formation and prevention of lymphocyte autoactivation. These germinal center-like LFs contain B cells expressing Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase and exhibit plasma cell (PC) differentiation upon activation. To explore their utility for vaccine testing, autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells were integrated into LF Chips. The human LF chips demonstrated improved antibody responses to split virion influenza vaccination compared to 2D cultures, which were enhanced by addition of a squalene-in-water emulsion adjuvant, and this was accompanied by increases in LF size and number.

In the refrigeration part, two different paradigms of cooling, namely coherent and incoherent, are defined. The connection that these paradigms have with other existing refrigeration techniques such as heat bath algorithmic cooling (HBAC), the resource theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics, and autonomous cooling is then made. Each paradigm is then investigated on its own. This in particular allows for the derivation of a general and attainable bound. The bound is striking in its simplicity: it depends on a single parameter of the environment/machine used to cool the system of interest. The creation of correlations part is devoted to the quantitative study of how much correlations can be created for a given amount of energy. After having precisely formulated the problem of interest, we solve it for arbitrary finite dimensional bipartite systems for vanishing background temperatures. For non-vanishing background temperature the symmetry of the problem breaks down, making it much harder to tackle. When both systems are copies of each other, enough symmetry is restored to formulate an upper bound valid for all (finite) dimensional systems and prove its attainability for dimension 3 and 4. We furthermore conjecture, as well as show evidence for, the bound to be attainable in any dimension.","Clivaz, Fabien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04321v1.pdf,333

Displacement and insecurity due to conflict, natural disasters, and epidemics place women and girls at higher risk of SRHR-related morbidity and mortality and reduce the coverage of essential SRHR services. This scoping review describes the measurement tools, methods, and indicators used to measure SRHR coverage and outcome indicators in humanitarian settings in the past 15 years and presents an accessible dashboard that can be used by governments, researchers and implementing organizations to identify available SRHR measurement tools. Methods: Scientific articles published between January 2004 and May 2019 were identified using Embase, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, PAIS index as well as relevant non-peer-reviewed literature available through websites of humanitarian organizations. Publications including data from low- or middle-income countries (LMICs), focused on women and/or girls living in areas impacted by a humanitarian crisis, where data was collected within five years of the crisis were included. Indicators extracted from these publications were categorized according to validated SRHR indicators recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Measurement tools, sampling and data collection methods, gap areas (geographical, topical and contextual), and indicators were catalogued for easy access in an interactive Tableau dashboard. Results: Our search yielded 42,081 peer-reviewed publications and 2,569 non-peer-reviewed reports. After initial title and abstract screening, 385 publications met the inclusion criteria. SRHR indicators were categorized into nine domains: abortion, antenatal care, family planning, gender-based violence, HIV and sexually transmitted infections, maternal health, maternal mortality, menstrual and gynecological health, and obstetric care (delivery). A total of 65 tools and questionnaires measuring SRHR were identified, of which 25 were designed specifically for humanitarian settings. Discussion: Although SRHR was measured in humanitarian settings, several gaps in measurement were identified. Abortion and gynaecological health were not consistently measured across included studies or validated WHO indicators. Toolkits and indicators identified in this review may be used to inform future SRHR data collection in humanitarian settings. However, identifying and/or developing innovative data collection methodologies should be a research priority, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic.","Goulart, C.

176766,P.99 Empowering midwives with arterial-line management,2021,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remodels the cell surface of infected cells to facilitate viral dissemination and promote immune evasion. The membrane-associated Vpu accessory protein encoded by HIV-1 plays a key role in this process by altering cell surface levels of multiple host proteins. Using an unbiased quantitative plasma membrane profiling approach, we previously identified CD47 as a putative host target downregulated by Vpu. CD47 is a ubiquitously-expressed cell surface protein that interacts with the myeloid cell inhibitory receptor SIRPα to deliver a “don’t-eat-me” signal, thus protecting cells from phagocytosis. In this study, we investigate whether CD47 modulation by HIV-1 Vpu might promote the susceptibility of macrophages to viral infection via phagocytosis of infected CD4+ T cells. Indeed, we find that Vpu downregulates CD47 expression on infected CD4+ T cells leading to an enhanced capture and phagocytosis by macrophages. Interestingly, it is through this process that a CCR5-tropic transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, which otherwise poorly infects macrophages in its cell-free form, becomes infectious in macrophages. Importantly, we show that HIV-1-infected cells expressing a Vpu-resistant CD47 mutant are less prone to infect macrophages through phagocytosis. Mechanistically, Vpu forms a physical complex with CD47 through its transmembrane domain and targets the latter for lysosomal degradation. These results reveal a novel role of Vpu in modulating macrophage infection, which has important implications for HIV-1 transmission in early stages of infection and the establishment of viral reservoir. IMPORTANCE Macrophages play critical roles in HIV transmission, viral spread early in infection, and as a reservoir of virus. Selective capture and engulfment of HIV-1 infected T cells was shown to drive efficient macrophage infection suggesting that this mechanism represents an important mode of infection notably for weakly macrophage-tropic T/F viruses. In this study, we provide insight into the signals that regulate this process. We show that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu downregulates cell surface levels of CD47, a host protein that interacts with the inhibitory receptor SIRPα to deliver a “don’t-eat-me” signal to macrophages. This allows for enhanced capture and phagocytosis of infected T cells by macrophages, ultimately leading to their productive infection even with T/F virus. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms governing the intercellular transmission of HIV-1 to macrophages with implications for the establishment of the macrophage reservoir and early HIV-1 dissemination in vivo.","Cong, Lijun; Sugden, Scott M.; Leclair, Pascal; Lim, Chinten James; Pham, Tram NQ.; Cohen, Éric A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.16.435750,333

Using the platform, we detect widespread differences in cell type-specific gene expression between subjects that are stable over multiple days. Summary Increasing evidence implicates the immune system in an overwhelming number of diseases, and distinct cell types play specific roles in their pathogenesis.1,2 Studies of peripheral blood have uncovered a wealth of associations between gene expression, environmental factors, disease risk, and therapeutic efficacy.4 For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple mechanistic paths have been found that lead to disease, and gene expression of specific immune cell types can be used as a predictor of therapeutic non-response.12 Furthermore, vaccines, drugs, and chemotherapy have been shown to yield different efficacy based on time of administration, and such findings have been linked to the time-dependence of gene expression in downstream pathways.21,22,23 However, human immune studies of gene expression between individuals and across time remain limited to a few cell types or time points per subject, constraining our understanding of how networks of heterogeneous cells making up each individual’s immune system respond to adverse events and change over time.","Dobreva, Tatyana; Brown, David; Park, Jong Hwee; Thomson, Matt",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.25.210468,333

185199,Emergency Department Adaptations to COVID-19.,2021,"This research proposes a global forecasting and inference method based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict policy interventions’ causal effects on an outcome over time through the counterfactual approach. The traditional univariate methods that operate within the well-established synthetic control method have strong linearity assumptions in the covariates. This has recently been addressed by successfully using univariate RNNs for this task. We use an RNN trained not univariately per series but globally across all time series, which allows us to model treated and control time series simultaneously over the pre-treatment period. Therewith, we do not need to make equivalence assumptions between distributions of the control and treated outcomes in the pre-treatment period. This allows us to achieve better accuracy and precisely isolate the effect of an intervention. We compare our novel approach with local univariate approaches on two real-world datasets on 1) how policy changes in Alcohol outlet licensing affect emergency service calls, and 2) how COVID19 lockdown measures affect emergency services use. Our results show that our novel method can outperform the accuracy of state-of-the-art predictions, thereby estimating the size of a causal effect more accurately. The experimental results are statistically significant, indicating our framework generates better counterfactual predictions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Grecov, P.; Bandara, K.; Bergmeir, C.; Ackermann, K.; Campbell, S.; Scott, D.; Lubman, D.","25th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, PAKDD 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75765-6_23,333

This emerging phenomenon was undeniable yet understudied. We investigated menstrual bleeding patterns among currently and formerly menstruating people, with a research design based off our expectations that these bleeding changes related to changes in clotting or inflammation, affecting normal menstrual repair. In this sample, 42% of people with regular menstrual cycles bled more heavily than usual, while 44% reported no change, after being vaccinated. Among people who typically do not menstruate, 71% of people on long-acting reversible contraceptives, 39% of people on gender-affirming hormones, and 66% of post-menopausal people reported breakthrough bleeding. We found increased/breakthrough bleeding was significantly associated with age, other vaccine side effects (fever, fatigue), history of pregnancy or birth, and ethnicity. Changes to menstrual bleeding are not uncommon nor dangerous, yet attention to these experiences is necessary to build trust in medicine.","Lee, K. M.; Junkins, E. J.; Fatima, U. A.; Cox, M.

Complexed antigen, in fact, is taken up with high efficiency thanks to Fc receptors borne by APC. Antibody/antigen ratio in the complexes proved to be a critical parameter in enhancing antigen presentation. Complexes in moderate antibody excess provided optimal T cell activation independently of the physical state of the complexes (precipitated by a second antibody or solubilized by complement). Complexes in extreme antibody excess, on the contrary, did not yield T cell activation although taken up by APC efficiently. The effect of antibodies at extreme excess was observed with substimulatory dose of antigen (loss of potentiation) and with optimal dose of antigen (loss of stimulation). An excess of specific polyclonal antibodies hampers proteolytic degradation of antigen in vitro, supporting the view that a similar mechanism may operate within the APC that have internalized immune complexes in extreme antibody excess. The possibility that immune complex forming in extreme antibody excess may turn off the T cell response is proposed as a regulatory mechanism.",,J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2118742/,333

186375,Augmented reality in clinical dental training and education.,2021-01-01,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for the new pandemic, which remains an important health and economic challenge worldwide. The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones. Diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of children are the most effective ways to control the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rohani, Pejman; Ahmadi Badi, , Sara; Moshiri, Arfa; Siadat, Seyed Davar",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682976/,333

DESIGN Retrospective descriptive cohort study. SETTING A regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS Children younger than 18 yrs with SARS. RESULTS Twenty-one children were included, with a mean age of 10.7 +/- 5.1 yrs. Children with SARS presented with fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, chills, headache, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Examination of the chest showed minimal auscultatory findings. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mild elevations of activated partial thromboplastin time, alanine transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase. Bacteriologic and virologic studies were all negative for common pathogens. Unilateral focal opacity was the commonest finding in chest radiography. High-resolution computerized tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic tool if the chest radiograph was negative. The clinical course was less severe in comparison with adult patients. However, adolescents (age, > or =12 yrs) resembled adults in their clinical features. When compared with the younger age group, the adolescents had significantly higher temperatures, more constitutional upset, and a greater need for steroid treatment. Children younger than 12 yrs seemed less ill but had more coughing. On the whole, the outcome was favorable. CONCLUSION Severe acute respiratory syndrome affects children, but the course is less severe. Nevertheless, the disease could have a significant psychosocial impact on children because of the potential seriousness of the disease in their adult family members.","Chiu, Wa-keung; Cheung, Patrick C H; Ng, K L; Ip, Patricia L S; Sugunan, V K; Luk, David C K; Ma, Louis C K; Chan, Bill H B; Lo, K L; Lai, W M",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12831407/,333

In two large-scale breeds with a mass occurrence of diarrhoea of the known etiology the state of health of calves before the vaccine application was compared with the state of health of calves born in the period after the vaccination. The following traits were selected for evaluating the severity of the disease: the age of calf at the beginning of the disease, character and intensity of diarrhoea, length of disease and results of treatment. In all the selected indicators, statistically significant differences were determined pointing to the fact that the vaccine used for increasing the immunity against enteropathogenic viruses and bacteria, applied in high pregnant cows and heifers before parturition, protected the sucking calves and calves fed the milk of their mothers against the disease in the first week after birth. The diarrhoea, occurring in the calves of the vaccinated cows and heifers mostly during the second week of age was easy to treat therapeutically and ended in most cases after a short period of a tea diet. After the vaccination, the death loss in both localities decreased more than eight times.","Mensík, J; Pecka, F; Stĕpánek, J; Zuffa, A; Salajka, E",Veterinarni medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2538950/,333

190640,Treatment of pediatric diaphyseal femur fractures.,2009,"Cell fusion induced by infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) varied markedly in extent and time course in four different murine cell lines. When inoculated at a multiplicity of 3 to 5 PFU per cell, the Sac-, L2, and DBT cell lines began to fuse by 7 h, were fused into confluent syncytia by 9 to 12 h, and peeled from the substrate by 10 to 14 h. These virulent virus-cell interactions were in striking contrast to the moderate interaction of MHV-A59 with the 17 Cl 1 cell line, in which only small syncytia were observed 18 h postinoculation, and greater than 50% of the cells remained unfused by 24 h. The yield of infectious virus produced by 17 Cl 1 cells was 10-fold higher than the yields from the other three cell lines. The processing of the nucleocapsid protein, the membrane glycoprotein E1, and the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 were found to differ significantly in the four cell lines. Since the E2 glycoprotein is responsible for virus-induced cell fusion, we attempted to correlate differences in cellular processing of E2 with differences in fusion of infected cells. The predominant intracellular form of E2 in all cell lines was the 180K species. Pulse-chase experiments showed that a small portion of the 17 Cl 1 cell-associated 180K E2 was cleaved by 1 h after synthesis to yield 90K E2, shown in the preceding paper to consist of two different glycoproteins called 90A and 90B (L. S. Sturman, C. S. Ricard, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 56:904-911, 1985). This cleavage occurred shortly before the release of virions from cells, as shown by pulse-chase experiments. After budding at intracellular membranes, virions released into the medium by the four cell lines contained different ratios of 180K to 90K E2. Virions from Sac- cells, which contained 100% 90K E2, fused L2 cells rapidly without requiring virus replication, whereas virions from 17 Cl 1 cells, which had 50% 90K E2, required trypsin activation to induce rapid fusion (Sturman et al., J. Virol. 56:904-911, 1985). The addition of protease inhibitors to the medium markedly delayed L2 cell fusion induced by MHV infection. The extent of coronavirus-induced cell fusion does not depend solely upon the percent cleavage of the E2 glycoprotein by cellular proteases, since extensive fusion was induced by infection of L2 and DBT cells but not 17 Cl 1 cells, although all three cell lines cleaved E2 to the same extent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Frana, M F; Behnke, J N; Sturman, L S; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2999444/,333

Recovery from alphavirus encephalitis can occur without apparent neurological damage through the effects of antibody and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). To establish an in vitro cell culture system that will allow the study of mechanisms of IFN-gamma-mediated control of Sindbis virus (SINV) replication in neurons, we have characterized the susceptibility to SINV infection and IFN-gamma responsiveness of two neuronal cell lines that can be differentiated in vitro: CSM14.1, a rat nigral cell line, and NSC34, a mouse motor neuron cell line. Undifferentiated CSM14.1 and NSC34 cells were permissive for SINV and susceptible to virus-induced cell death. With differentiation, CSM14.1 cells reduced virus replication and became progressively resistant to virus-induced cell death, resulting in prolonged virus replication. NSC34 cells did not differentiate completely and became only partially resistant to SINV infection. Both CSM14.1 and NSC34 cells responded to pretreatment with IFN-gamma by decreasing SINV replication. Differentiated CSM14.1 cells treated 24 h after infection with IFN-gamma responded with increased cell viability and clearance of infectious virus. IFN-gamma treatment sequentially altered the ratio of genomic to subgenomic viral RNA synthesis, promoted recovery of cellular protein synthesis, reduced viral protein synthesis, and inhibited viral RNA transcription within 24 h after treatment. We conclude that CSM14.1 cells provide an excellent model for the study of IFN-gamma-mediated noncytolytic clearance of SINV from mature neurons.","Burdeinick-Kerr, Rebeca; Griffin, Diane E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15827152/,333

In this regards, medicinal plants and natural products offer safe and inexpensive platforms for discovery of efficient and novel anti-viral agents. We have investigated the potential anti-viral activities of Veronica persica Poir. as a medicinal plant against herpes simplex viruses (HSVs). In vitro screening of the ethanol plant extract against HSV-1 and HSV-2 infected Vero cells revealed the extract to show a dose-dependent inhibitory activity against both virus strains. After fractionation of the extract by a stepwise methanol gradient and evaluation of each fraction, the 80% methanol fraction displayed a pronounced inhibitory activity against the herpes viruses. The highest antiviral activity was observed when the Vero cells were treated with the extract both during and after infection by viruses. Moreover, the extract showed a prominent synergistic activity in combination with acyclovir anti-HSV therapy.

However, rhinovirus (RV) infection can lead to exacerbation of asthma, with worsening in airway hyperresponsiveness and bronchial inflammation. The current authors questioned whether such involvement of the intrapulmonary airways is disease specific. Twelve nonatopic, healthy subjects (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) >80% predicted, provocation concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) >8 mg x mL(-1)) were experimentally infected with RV16. Next to PC20 and the maximal response to methacholine (MFEV1 and MV'40p), the numbers of mucosal inflammatory cells and epithelial intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression in bronchial biopsies were assessed before and 6 days after RV16 inoculation. RV16 infection induced a small but consistent increase in maximal airway narrowing, without a change in PC20. There was a significant increase in bronchial epithelial ICAM-1 expression after RV16, whereas inflammatory cell counts did not change. Nevertheless, the change in the number of submucosal CD3+ cells was correlated with the change in MV'40p. In conclusion, rhinovirus infection in normal subjects induces a limited, but significant increase in maximal airway narrowing, which is associated with changes in bronchial T-cell numbers. Together with the upregulation of bronchial epithelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1, these findings indicate that, even in healthy subjects, rhinovirus infection affects the intrapulmonary airways.","de Kluijver, J; Grünberg, K; Sont, J K; Hoogeveen, M; van Schadewijk, W A A M; de Klerk, E P A; Dick, C R; van Krieken, J H J M; Sterk, P J",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12212955/,333

194373,Silent or 'Happy' Hypoxemia: An Urgent Dilemma for COVID-19 Patient Care.,2020-10-01,"Intestinal cholesterol absorption is an important regulator of serum cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe is a specific inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption recently introduced into medical practice; its mechanism of action, however, is still unknown. Ezetimibe neither influences the release of cholesterol from mixed micelles in the gut lumen nor the transfer of cholesterol to the enterocyte brush border membrane. With membrane-impermeable Ezetimibe analogues we could demonstrate that binding of cholesterol absorption inhibitors to the brush border membrane of small intestinal enterocytes from the gut lumen is sufficient for inhibition of cholesterol absorption. A 145-kDa integral membrane protein was identified as the molecular target for cholesterol absorption inhibitors in the enterocyte brush border membrane by photoaffinity labeling with photoreactive Ezetimibe analogues (Kramer, W., Glombik, H., Petry, S., Heuer, H., Schafer, H. L., Wendler, W., Corsiero, D., Girbig, F., and Weyland, C. (2000) FEBS Lett. 487, 293-297). The 145-kDa Ezetimibe-binding protein was purified by three different methods and sequencing revealed its identity with the membrane-bound ectoenzyme aminopeptidase N ((alanyl)aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.2; APN; leukemia antigen CD13). The enzymatic activity of APN was not influenced by Ezetimibe (analogues). The uptake of cholesterol delivered by mixed micelles by confluent CaCo-2 cells was partially inhibited by Ezetimibe and nonabsorbable Ezetimibe analogues. Preincubation of confluent CaCo-2 cells with Ezetimibe led to a strong decrease of fluorescent APN staining with a monoclonal antibody in the plasma membrane. Independent on its enzymatic activity, aminopeptidase N is involved in endocytotic processes like the uptake of viruses. Our findings suggest that binding of Ezetimibe to APN from the lumen of the small intestine blocks endocytosis of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, thereby limiting intestinal cholesterol absorption.","Kramer, Werner; Girbig, Frank; Corsiero, Daniel; Pfenninger, Anja; Frick, Wendelin; Jähne, Gerhard; Rhein, Matthias; Wendler, Wolfgang; Lottspeich, Friedrich; Hochleitner, Elisabeth O; Orsó, Evelyn; Schmitz, Gerd",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15494415/,333

OBJECTIVE The objective was to study the relative effect of tocotrienol supplements of different compositions (mixed alpha- plus gamma-, high gamma-, or P25-complex tocotrienol) on blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, and the excretion of 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha), a measure of oxidative stress, in healthy hypercholesterolemic men and women. DESIGN This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-design study in which subjects (n = 67 men and women) consumed 1 of 3 commercially available tocotrienol supplements or a safflower oil placebo for 28 d. Blood and urine samples were obtained before and after the 28-d supplementation phase for analysis of fasting blood lipids, glucose, tocotrienols and tocopherols, and 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha). RESULTS Overall, serum tocotrienols were increased in subjects who consumed tocotrienols, which showed that the putatively active components were absorbed. No significant differences in mean lipid or glucose concentrations were observed among the 4 treatment groups at the end of the 28-d supplementation phase. However, when the values were expressed as a percentage change from the concentrations during the presupplementation run-in phase, LDL cholesterol increased slightly (7 +/- 2%) but significantly (P < 0.05) in the group consuming the mixed alpha- plus gamma-tocotrienol supplement when compared with LDL cholesterol in the group consuming the P25-complex tocotrienol. Neither mean concentrations nor the percentage change in 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) differed significantly among treatments. CONCLUSION Supplementation with 200 mg tocotrienols/d from 3 commercially available sources has no beneficial effect on key cardiovascular disease risk factors in highly compliant adults with elevated blood lipid concentrations.","Mustad, Vikkie A; Smith, Carla A; Ruey, Peter P; Edens, Neile K; DeMichele, Stephen J",The American journal of clinical nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12450888/,333

METHODS A retrospective survey was conducted in Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Taiyuan according to the epidemic situations of SARS, and 2532 subjects were randomly selected from constructive industry, school, and commercial business and residents in urban and rural areas. The perceive stress was measured by Chinese perceived stress scale (CPSS), and health related behavior during SARS was tested by uniform and self-made questionnaire. EpiData 2.0 was used for data management and CPSS value was calculated according to answer to 14 questions contained in the scale. Health risk stress among different population group and health related behavior among low, medium and high stress state were analyzed by SPSS 11.5. RESULTS 2424 subjects were involved in the survey. The CPSS value was measured from 0 - 49 (22.7 +/- 6.8), M = 24.0. 39.3% (953/2379) subjects were under the health risk stress. The health related behaviors such as washing hands, opening the window for air, keeping away from others when cough and sneeze, doing exercises etc were reduced with the stress increased. Logistic regression indicated that compared with the persons with the thoughts of nothing serious of SARS, without any dread of SARS, and knowing nothing about prevention of SARS, the perceived stress was significantly related with perceiving of the thread to certain extent (beta = 0.41, Wald chi(2) = 4.84, P = 0.03), worrying little about the epidemic (beta = 0.50, Wald chi(2) = 6.69, P = 0.01), worrying about it to certain extent (beta = 1.39, Wald chi(2) = 48.59, P = 0.00) and scared so much (beta = 1.77, Wald chi(2) = 53.59, P = 0.00), and knowing little about the prevention (beta = 0.74, Wald chi(2) = 4.48, P = 0.03), knowing something about prevention (beta = -0.98, Wald chi(2) = 8.29, P = 0.00) and knowing the prevention very well (beta = -1.18, Wald chi(2) = 10.66, P = 0.00). CONCLUSION The adoption of health related behaviors declined with increase of perceived stress. Opening connection to authority and government, enhancing the awareness of outburst affairs among general public and providing positive social support may be effective ways to reduce the population perceived stress.","Lü, Shu-Hong; Tian, Ben-Chun; Yang, Ting-Zhong; Chen, Ding-Wan; Chi, Yan-Hua",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20388333/,333

The workshop was held virtually because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Twenty-three participants attended from 8 countries: Canada, Guyana, Kenya, Nigeria, Switzerland, Tanzania, Uganda and the United States. More participants were able to attend the virtual meeting than the traditional in-person meetings. Web-based videoconference software was used, participants presented prerecorded PowerPoint videos, and questions were raised using a written chat. The review proved successful, with discussions and recommendations for improvements surrounding course quality, lecture content, skills sessions, curriculum variations and clinical practical scenarios. The CNIS's successful experience conducting an online curriculum review involving international participants may prove useful to others proceeding with collaborative projects during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lett, Ronald; Bola, Rajan; Boniface, Respicious; Eamer, Gilgamesh; Gathecha, Gladwell",Canadian journal of surgery.

198806,The Impact of Systematic Safety Precautions on COVID-19 Risk Exposure and Transmission Rates in Outpatient Healthcare Workers.,2020,"One important therapeutic goal during CNS injury from trauma or demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis is to develop methods to promote remyelination. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous remyelination in the toxic nonimmune model of lysolecithin-induced demyelination can be enhanced by manipulating the inflammatory response. In PBS-treated SJL/J mice, the number of remyelinating axons per square millimeter of lesion area increased significantly 3 and 5 weeks after lysolecithin injection in the spinal cord. However, methylprednisolone or a monoclonal antibody (mAb), SCH94.03, developed for its ability to promote remyelination in the Theiler's virus murine model of demyelination, further increased the number of remyelinating axons per lesion area at 3 weeks by a factor of 2.6 and 1.9, respectively, but did not increase the ratio of myelin sheath thickness to axon diameter or the number of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in the lesion. After 3 weeks, the number of remyelinating axons in the methylprednisolone or mAb SCH94.03 treatment groups was similar to the spontaneous remyelination in the 5 week PBS control-treated group, indicating that these treatments promoted remyelination by increasing its rate rather than its extent. To address a mechanism for promoting remyelination, through an effect on scavenger function, we assessed morphometrically the number of macrophages in lesions after methylprednisolone and mAb SCH94.03 treatment. Methylprednisolone reduced the number of macrophages, but SCH94.03 did not, although both enhanced remyelination. This study supports the hypothesis that even in toxic nonprimary immune demyelination, manipulating the inflammatory response is a benefit in myelin repair.","Pavelko, K D; van Engelen, B G; Rodriguez, M",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9502810/,333
199101,Correction to: Periprosthetic fractures after medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty: a narrative review,2021,"The spike (S) protein of murine coronavirus JHMV, variant cl-2, comprises two polypeptides, N-terminal S1 (with an N-terminal signal peptide) and C-terminal S2 (with a C-terminal transmembrane domain). In order to express these subunits, we constructed three different vaccinia virus transfer vectors (VV-TVs) containing cDNAs encoding the S1 protein without a transmembrane domain (pSFS1utt), the S1 protein with a C-terminal transmembrane domain derived from S2 (pSFS1tmd) or the S2 protein with an N-terminal signal peptide derived from S1 (pSFssS2). The S1 and S2 proteins were expressed in DBT cells by infection with vaccinia virus and transfection of these VV-TVs. In cells transfected with the pSFS1utt and pSFS1tmd, 96K and 106K proteins, respectively, were detected by Western blotting. The ssS2 protein expressed by pSFssS2 was 96K, which was slightly larger than the authentic S2 protein. The S1utt and S1tmd proteins were shown by binding studies using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to be antigenically indistinguishable from the authentic S1 protein. The S1tmd and ssS2 proteins were detected on the cell surface by immunofluorescence, whereas the S1utt protein was not. However, when the S1utt protein was expressed together with the ssS2 protein, the S1utt was detected on the cell membrane. This suggested that the S1utt was associated with ssS2 on the cell membrane. These observations indicate that the expressed S1 and S2 proteins associated in a similar manner to the authentic S1 and S2 proteins produced in DBT cells infected with cl-2. However, cell fusion was not observed in cells expressing either S1 or S2 nor in cells coexpressing both S1 and S2, although the whole S protein expressed by VV-TV did induce fusion.","Kubo, H; Taguchi, F",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8245853/,333

We have analysed the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) infection. Surprisingly, we detected only a very clear virus-specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted cytotoxicity in mice infected with MHV-A59. We found no evidence of activation of the classical CD8+ MHC class I-restricted CTL. The virus-specific CD4+ CTL derived from two different mouse strains having different MHC haplotypes recognized the same immunodominant epitope. This epitope, comprising the amino acid residues 329-343 of the viral S-glycoprotein, was recognized both at the polyclonal level and by virus-specific CTL clones. Transfer studies using a MHV-A59-specific CD4+ CTL clone showed significant protection against a lethal challenge with MHV-A59, implicating that these CD4+ CTL play a pivotal role in the protection against MHV-A59 infections.","Heemskerk, M H; Schoemaker, H M; Spaan, W J; Boog, C J",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7790024/,333
200925,Response of L V Prasad Eye Institute to COVID-19 outbreak in India: Experience at its tertiary eye care centre and adoption to its Eye Health Pyramid,2021,"Friend virus (FV) and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) are endemic mouse viruses that can cause long-term chronic infections in mice. We found that numerous mouse-passaged FV isolates also contained LDV and that coinfection with LDV delayed FV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses during acute infection. While LDV did not alter the type of acute pathology induced by FV, which was severe splenomegaly caused by erythroproliferation, the immunosuppression mediated by LDV increased both the severity and the duration of FV infection. Compared to mice infected with FV alone, those coinfected with both FV and LDV had delayed CD8(+) T-cell responses, as measured by FV-specific tetramers. This delayed response accounted for the prolonged and exacerbated acute phase of FV infection. Suppression of FV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses occurred not only in mice infected concomitantly with LDV but also in mice chronically infected with LDV 8 weeks prior to infection with FV. The LDV-induced suppression was not mediated by T regulatory cells, and no inhibition of the CD4(+) T-cell or antibody responses was observed. Considering that most human adults are carriers of chronically infectious viruses at the time of new virus insults and that coinfections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus are currently epidemic, it is of great interest to determine how infection with one virus may impact host responses to a second infection. Coinfection of mice with LDV and FV provides a well-defined, natural host model for such studies.","Robertson, Shelly J; Ammann, Christoph G; Messer, Ronald J; Carmody, Aaron B; Myers, Lara; Dittmer, Ulf; Nair, Savita; Gerlach, Nicole; Evans, Leonard H; Cafruny, William A; Hasenkrug, Kim J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959678/,333

Of the 392 questionnaires circulated, 251 (64 per cent) were returned, and 209 of these were usable. Negative binomial regression analysis indicated that the isolation of bought-in sheep, and the separation and individual treatment of diseased sheep with parenteral antibiotics, foot trimming and topical foot sprays were associated with a significantly lower prevalence of footrot in a flock. In contrast, ewe flocks which were routinely foot trimmed more than once a year had a significantly higher prevalence of footrot. No evidence was found that footbathing a flock reduced the level of footrot, except on the 14 per cent of farms where the penning and race facilities for footbathing were reported by the farmer to be excellent.

201356,Diabetic foot ulceration in COVID-19 lockdown: cause for concern or unexpected benefit?,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) contains a single spike (S) protein, which binds to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), induces membrane fusion and serves as a neutralizing antigen. A SARS-CoV-S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype using the VSVDeltaG* system was generated. Partial deletion of the SARS-CoV-S protein cytoplasmic domain allowed efficient incorporation into VSV particles and led to the generation of a pseudotype (VSV-SARS-St19) at high titre. Green fluorescent protein expression was demonstrated as early as 7 h after infection of Vero E6 cells with VSV-SARS-St19. VSV-SARS-St19 was neutralized by anti-SARS-CoV antibody and soluble ACE2, and its infection was blocked by treatment of Vero E6 cells with anti-ACE2 antibody. These results indicated that VSV-SARS-St19 infection is mediated by SARS-CoV-S protein in an ACE2-dependent manner. VSV-SARS-St19 will be useful for analysing the function of SARS-CoV-S protein and for developing rapid methods of detecting neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS-CoV infection.","Fukushi, Shuetsu; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Saijo, Masayuki; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Miyajima, Naoko; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Itamura, Shigeyuki; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16033974/,333

Two vaccines were granted for emergency use by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in India, Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin® (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). Sputnik - V has been granted EUA in the month of April 2021. The purpose of this study is to determine the association of COVID-19 infection, its severity and outcome in COVID-19 vaccinated people. METHODS This was a hospital based prospective cohort study done between March to June 2021 at PBM Associated Group of Hospitals (AGH), Bikaner, Raj. Total 1028 COVID suspected cases consulted in COVID OPD or hospitalized under department of medicine, out of which 146 satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, out of these 146, first 100 cases who gave consent for part of study were selected. RESULTS Among 100 COVID-19 infected cases, 49 received first dose while rest got both doses. After first dose of vaccination 42.86% had mild and 32.65% had severe clinical infection while after both doses 80.39% had mild and 11.76% had severe clinical infection. On evaluation of HRCT Chest, after first dose 8.16% had normal 40.82% were in severe category while those who got both doses it was 52.82% 3.92% respectively.

203878,Assessing the risk of dupilumab use for atopic dermatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To outline strategies for the treatment of migraine which do not require in-person visits to clinic or the emergency department, and to describe ways that health insurance companies can remove barriers to quality care for migraine. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global pandemic causing widespread infections and death. To control the spread of infection we are called to observe ""social distancing"" and we have been asked to postpone any procedures which are not essential. Since procedural therapies are a mainstay of headache care, the inability to do procedures could negatively affect our patients with migraine. In this manuscript we review alternative therapies, with particular attention to those which may be contra-indicated in the setting of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN/RESULTS: The manuscript reviews the use of telemedicine visits and acute, bridge, and preventive therapies for migraine. We focus on evidence-based treatment where possible, but also describe ""real world"" strategies which may be tried. In each section we call out areas where changes to rules from commercial health insurance companies would facilitate better migraine care. CONCLUSIONS: Our common goal as health care providers is to maximize the health and safety of our patients. Successful management of migraine with avoidance of in-person clinic and emergency department visits further benefits the current urgent societal goal of maintaining social distance to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szperka, Christina L; Ailani, Jessica; Barmherzig, Rebecca; Klein, Brad C; Minen, Mia T; Halker Singh, Rashmi B; Shapiro, Robert E",Headache,,333
203992,Healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile infection during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in Romania,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several countries have released digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps to complement manual contact tracing for combatting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. DPT aims to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. The success of DPT apps depends on user acceptance and the embedding of DPT into the pandemic mitigation strategy. OBJECTIVE: By searching for media articles published during the first 3 months after DPT launch, the implementation of DPT in Switzerland was evaluated to inform similar undertakings in other countries. The second aim of the study was to create a link between reported DPT implementation challenges and normalization process theory for planning and optimizing complex digital health interventions, which can provide useful guidance for decision-making in DPT design and implementation. METHODS: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app (SwissCovid) published in German or French between July 4 and October 3, 2020. In a structured process, topics were extracted and clustered manually from articles that were deemed pertinent. Extracted topics were mapped to four NPT constructs, which reflected the flow of intervention development from planning, stakeholder onboarding, and execution to critical appraisal. Coherence constructs describe sense-making by stakeholders, cognitive participation constructs reflect participants' efforts to create engagement with the intervention, collective actions refer to intervention execution and joint stakeholder efforts to make the intervention work, and reflexive monitoring refers to collective risk-benefit appraisals to create improvements. RESULTS: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. Five challenge areas were identified: communication challenges, challenges for DPT to interface with other processes, fear of resource competition with established pandemic mitigation measures, unclear DPT effectiveness, and obstacles to greater user coverage and compliance. Specifically, several articles mentioned unclear DPT benefits to affect commitment and to raise fears among different health system actors regarding resource competition. Moreover, media reports indicated process interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs from health system actors. Finally, reports suggested misaligned incentives, not only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors in the app notification cascade. NPT provided a well-fitting framework to contextualize the different DPT implementation challenges and to highlight improvement strategies, namely a better alignment of stakeholder incentives, or stakeholder-specific communication to address their concerns about DPT. CONCLUSIONS: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate that nontechnical implementation challenges may affect the effectiveness of DPT. The NPT analysis provides a novel perspective on DPT implementation and stresses the need for stakeholder inclusion in development and operationalization.","von Wyl, Viktor",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,333

The purpose of this article is to answer the question of whether the change in the composition of liposomes affected the parameters of generated aerosol and whether the nebulization process affected observed properties of liposomes. Firstly, liposomes with different composition were prepared and their properties were checked by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering. The membrane properties were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy - especially generalized polarization (Laurdan) and anisotropy (Diphenylhexatriene). The same characteristic of liposomes was measured after the nebulization by vibrating mesh nebulizer. Cholesterol was capable of liposome stabilization because of increased membrane fluidity. The membrane properties of the outer and inner parts were not influenced by the nebulization process. Electrostatic stabilization was successful for the lowest concentration of phosphatidic acid, but after the nebulization process the hydration of the membrane outer part was changed. Higher amount of PEG needs to be added for successful steric stabilization. The nebulization process of the two lowest concentrations of PEG slightly influenced immobilized water and the rigidity of inner part of the membrane (especially around the phase transition temperature).","Szabová, Jana; Misík, Ondrej; Havlíková, Martina; Lízal, Frantisek; Mravec, Filip",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,333

METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using an electronic survey that was distributed to orthodontic patients who were not seen in clinic for 2 to 3 months due to clinic closure. The survey included demographics, types of orthodontic emergencies, Numerical Rating Scale, and Manchester Orofacial Pain Disability Scale. RESULTS: There were a total of 150 respondents with mean age of 20 years; 57.33% were female patients. The most common reported orthodontic emergencies were poking wire 30%, debonded brackets 27.3%, bad odor 24%, sharp ligature tie 20%, inflammation and bleeding 9.3%, ulcer 8.7%, and problematic palatal device 8%. Pain was significantly associated with poking wire (P < 0.001), sharp ligature tie (P < 0.01), ulcer (P < 0.05), and problematic palatal device (P < 0.01). Poking wire, sharp ligature tie, and problematic palatal device were found to be significant predictors of pain intensity. Median pain intensity was 3, similar to the median disability score. There was a significant association between pain intensity and disability score (P < 0.01). With each unit increase in pain intensity, the disability score increased by 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in receiving orthodontic care could result in an orthodontic emergency, yet pain and disability resulting from these events are minimal. The decision to resume clinical service should be evaluated considering risks and benefits in case of the pandemic. Further studies are required.","Turkistani, Khadijah A",J World Fed Orthod,,333

211792,Establishing and managing a quarantine and isolation centre in COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread all over the world, becoming pandemic. Several studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor that increases mortality and other adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may bind dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for entering cells of the respiratory tract. Besides, DPP4 takes part in immune system regulation. Thus, DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) may play a role against COVID-19. METHODS: We focused on the impact of DPP4i treatment on COVID-19-related outcomes in people with DM. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on this topic. RESULTS: Retrospective observational studies provide inconsistent results on the association between use of DPP4i and outcomes of COVID-19. While two studies reported significantly lower mortality rates among patients with DM who received DPP4i versus those who did not, a series of other studies showed no effect of DPP4i or even worse outcomes. A meta-analysis of 7 studies yielded a neutral estimate of the risk ratio of COVID-19-related mortality among users of DPP4i (0.81; 95% CI 0.57-1.15). CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized controlled trials, observational research available so far provides inconclusive results and insufficient evidence to recommend use of DPP4i against COVID-19.","Bonora, B M; Avogaro, A; Fadini, G P",J. endocrinol. invest,,333

The setup is simulated using the Volume-Of-Fluid method with octree mesh adaptation, the latter allowing grid sizes small enough to capture the Kolmogorov length scale. The results confirm the trend to an intermediate distribution between a Log-Normal and a Pareto distribution $P(d) \propto d^{-3.3}$ for the distribution of droplet sizes in agreement with a previous re-analysis of experimental results by one of the authors. The mechanism of atomisation does not differ qualitatively from the multiphase mixing layer experiments and simulations. No mechanism for a bimodal distribution, also sometimes observed, is evidenced in these simulations.","Pairetti, Cesar; Villiers, Raphael; Zaleski, St'ephane",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05662v2.pdf,333

214032,Working in the era of COVID-19: An organization model for maxillofacial surgery based on telemedicine and video consultation,2021,"Remote consultations are likely to grow in importance in the following years, especially if the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues. Patients' opinions on teledermatology have already been analyzed, but a current analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. The purpose of this survey was to investigate the satisfaction of patients who had received dermatological advice via telephone during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze their general opinion about eHealth as well as possible limitations for a broad implementation. Ninety-one patients managed in the dermatology department using telephone consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic were interviewed. An anonymous questionnaire, including the established quality of life questionnaire (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI]), was used. It was found that men were more satisfied with telephone consultations than women (p = 0.029), educational level and age did not correlate with satisfaction (p = 0.186 and 388, respectively), and the longer the waiting time for a telephone consultation, the lower the satisfaction (p = 0.001). Grouped analysis of all participants showed that the majority (54.0% n = 38/71) were ""very happy"" with the telephone consultation. Higher disease burden (DLQI) was associated with lower satisfaction (p = 0.042). The main stated reasons for using telemedicine were shorter waiting times (51.6% n = 47/91) and no travel requirement (57.1% n = 47/91). Almost one-quarter (23.1% n = 21/89) of patients would use teledermatology in the future, 17.6% (n = 16/89) would not, and 57.1% (n = 51/89) would only use it in addition to a traditional consultation with personal contact. In conclusion, most patients in the study group still preferred traditional face-to-face medical consultations to telephone consultations, but also desired an add-on telemedical tool. Dermatological care using more modern telemedicine technologies than telephone conferencing is needed to better address patients' desires, especially in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stadler, Pia-Charlotte; Senner, Sonja; Frey, Surina; Clanner-Engelshofen, Benjamin M; H Frommherz, Leonie; French, Lars E; Reinholz, Markus",J Dermatol,,333

It poses a grave threat to human life and health. The purpose of the study is to investigate the chest CT findings and progression of the disease observed in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Forty-nine confirmed cases of adult COVID-19 patients with common type, severe and critically severe type were included in this retrospective single-center study. The thin-section chest CT features and progress of the disease were evaluated. The clinical and chest imaging findings of COVID-19 patients with different severity types were compared. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score (a prediction of mortality risk) were calculated in those patients. RESULTS: Among the 49 patients, 35 patients (71%) were common type and 14 patients (28%) were severe and critically severe type. Nearly all patients (98%) had pure ground-glass opacities (GGO) in CT imaging. Of the severe and critically severe type patients, 86% exhibited GGO with consolidation, in comparison with 54% of the patients with common type. Fibrosis presented in 79% of the severe and critically severe type patients and 43% of the common type patients. The severe and critically severe type patients were significantly more prone to experience five-lobe involvement compared to the common type patients (p = 0.002). The severe and critically severe type patients also had higher CT severity and MuLBSTA scores than the common type patients (5.43 ± 2.38 vs 3.37 ± 2.40, p < 0.001;and 10.21 ± 3.83 vs 4.63 ± 3.43, p < 0.001, respectively). MuLBSTA score was positively correlated with admittance to the intensive care unit (p = 0.005, r = 0.351). Nineteen patients underwent three times CT scan. The interval between first and second CT scan was 4[4,8] days, second and third was 3[2,4] days. There were greater improvements in the third CT follow-up findings compared to the second (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The severe and critically severe type patients often experienced more severe lung lesions, including GGO with consolidation. The CT severity score and MuLBSTA score may be helpful for the assessment of COVID-19 severity and progression. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Chest CT has the value of evaluated radiographical features of COVID-19 and allow for dynamic observation of the disease progression. Considering coagulation disorder of COVID-19, MuLBSTA score may need to be updated to increase new understanding of COVID-19.","Xie, Linjun; Hou, Keke; Xu, Huayan; Fu, Hang; Xu, Rong; Liu, Hui; Zhou, Zhongqin; Li, Zhenlin; Yang, Ming; Guo, Yingkun",Br J Radiol,,333

METHODS: We described all adults with COVID-19 or influenza discharged from inpatient medical services and medical-surgical intensive care units (ICUs) between Nov. 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patient outcomes using multivariable regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic factors and comorbidity level. We validated the accuracy of 7 externally developed risk scores to predict mortality among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 1027 hospital admissions with COVID-19 (median age 65 yr, 59.1% male) and 783 with influenza (median age 68 yr, 50.8% male). Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater in-hospital mortality (unadjusted 19.9% v. 6.1%, adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56-4.68), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% v. 18.0%, adjusted RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25-1.80) and hospital length of stay (unadjusted median 8.7 d v. 4.8 d, adjusted rate ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.25-1.69). Thirty-day readmission was not significantly different (unadjusted 9.3% v. 9.6%, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70-1.39). Three points-based risk scores for predicting in-hospital mortality showed good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] ranging from 0.72 to 0.81) and calibration. INTERPRETATION: During the first wave of the pandemic, admission to hospital for COVID-19 was associated with significantly greater mortality, ICU use and hospital length of stay than influenza. Simple risk scores can predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 with good accuracy.","Verma, Amol A; Hora, Tejasvi; Jung, Hae Young; Fralick, Michael; Malecki, Sarah L; Lapointe-Shaw, Lauren; Weinerman, Adina; Tang, Terence; Kwan, Janice L; Liu, Jessica J; Rawal, Shail; Chan, Timothy C Y; Cheung, Angela M; Rosella, Laura C; Ghassemi, Marzyeh; Herridge, Margaret; Mamdani, Muhammad; Razak, Fahad",CMAJ,,333

Previous studies described the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, but knowledge gaps remain in the Middle East region. Identifying these features will help in mapping the disease and guiding pandemic management. A multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional study was initiated to describe the demographic data, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 cases across all the regions of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The analysis included all laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients from the 1st of March 2020 to 31st of March 2020 across all regions of Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, incubation periods, laboratory findings, and patient outcomes data were retrieved from 1519 cases in the Health Electronic Surveillance Network Database. RESULTS: The median age was 36 years and 54.3% (n = 825) of the patients were men. Patients working in health care facilities represented 12.5% of the cases (n = 190) and 9.3% of cases were asymptomatic. The median incubation period was 6 days. The most common symptoms were cough (89.4%), fever (85.6%), and sore throat (81.6%); 20.1% of the patients had underlying comorbidities. Hypertension was seen in 8.8% and diabetes in 7.6% of all the cases. The percentage of cases with temperatures >38Ö¯C was 20.3% (n = 129), and 1.6% of patients had heart rates &#8805;125 beats/min and 4.7% of them had respiratory rates of >24 breaths/min. Lymphocytopenia occurred in 37.5% of cases. Overall, 71.6% of patients were admitted to hospitals and 4.7% required ICU treatment. We could not completely assess the clinical courses or final outcomes of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: In this multi-center retrospective study, fever and cough were common symptoms. Special attention should be addressed toward asymptomatic carriers and workers in health care facilities as they play a key role in disease transmission.","Alsofayan, Yousef M; Althunayyan, Saqer M; Khan, Anas A; Hakawi, Ahmed M; Assiri, Abdullah M",J Infect Public Health,,333

This article situates the pandemic within a historical conjuncture in which various post-neoliberal formations are being struggled over. These emergent formations will in turn be indelibly impacted by the pandemic’s social, cultural, and political economic dimensions. Key to this uncertain future is a phenomenon we call collective disorientation, a concept that is implicated in the emergence, experience, and effects of the pandemic, as well as the political prospects for surviving the cascading crises of the pandemic conjuncture. Though the pandemic is a historically disorienting force, the cultural studies tradition is remarkably well-equipped to contribute to collective struggles seeking loci for new articulations beyond the COVID-19 conjuncture.","Means, Alexander J.; Slater, Graham B.",Cultural Studies,,333

Due to the risk of infection, in Germany no sports events with live spectators were allowed for weeks starting on March 13. The question arises, what would be the impact on spectators and with that on live broadcasting for different sports? While professional sport leagues like handball and hockey (ice hockey) stopped, the football (soccer) league restarted games without spectators on May 16. Using two approaches of sports action as a public presentation of performance and the consumption capital theory, the share of revenues like media, spectators, sponsoring of the biggest sport leagues in Germany is compared. Following this up, the economic impact of COVID-19 on professional sports in Germany is explained. As a result games without spectators (‘ghost games’), the gap between major sports and minor sports seems to be becoming larger.","Horky, Thomas",Soccer Soc.,,333

The disease has claimed many fatalities as it has transcended from one country to another since it was first discovered in China in late 2019. To prevent further morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, most of the countries initiated a countrywide lockdown. While physical distancing and lockdowns helped in curbing the spread of this novel coronavirus, it led to massive economic losses for the nations. Positive impacts have been observed due to lockdown in terms of improved air quality of the nations. In the current research, ten tropical and subtropical countries have been analysed from multiple angles, including air pollution, assessment and valuation of health impacts and economic loss of countries during COVID-19 lockdown. Countries include Brazil, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Validated Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) binning model is used on data collated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) for all the countries for the month of January to May 2019 and 2020. The concentration results of PM2.5 show that air pollution has drastically reduced in 2020 post lockdown for all countries. The highest average concentration obtained by converting aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2020 is observed for Thailand as 121.9 µg/m3 and the lowest for Mexico as 36.27 µg/m3. As air pollution is found to decrease in the April and May months of 2020 for nearly all countries, they are compared with respective previous year values for the same duration to calculate the reduced health burden due to lockdown. The present study estimates that cumulative about 100.9 Billion US$ are saved due to reduced air pollution externalities, which are about 25% of the cumulative economic loss of 435.9 Billion US$.","Bherwani, Hemant; Kumar, Suman; Musugu, Kavya; Nair, Moorthy; Gautam, Sneha; Gupta, Ankit; Ho, Chang-Hoi; Anshul, Avneesh; Kumar, Rakesh",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

METHODS: Fifty-six patients, who were admitted to the emergency clinic and diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, were included in the study. Data on clinical characteristics, inflammatory parameters and vitamin D status were recorded for each patient. All the participants had data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D status within the last 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The patients were stratified as those with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL and higher than 20 ng/mL. A group with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL had lower lymphocyte counts and lower haemoglobin levels that was statistically significant (respectively; p = 0.021, p = 0.035). Higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were seen in the vitamin D-deficient group (p = 0.013). It was observed that vitamin D status of the patients who required oxygen therapy were lower than those who did not require oxygen therapy, not statistically significant (p = 0.05). Patients who did not use vitamin D supplementation within 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection had more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Cases with lower vitamin D status had increased inflammatory markers and worse clinical outcomes than patients with higher vitamin D status. This study suggests that vitamin D status can be used as a prognostic factor in COVID-19 patients, and vitamin D supplementation can be recommended to improve the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection.","Ünsal, Y A; Gül, Ö Ö; Cander, S; Ersoy, C; Aydemir, E; Ates, C; Uzun, Z; Armagan, E; Ünsal, O; Ertürk, E",J. endocrinol. invest,,333

We performed a systematic review to assess whether ethnicity has been reported in patients with COVID-19 and its relation to clinical outcomes. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and PROSPERO for English-language citations on ethnicity and COVID-19 (1stDecember 2019-15thMay 2020). We also reviewed: COVID-19 articles in NEJM, Lancet, BMJ, JAMA, clinical trial protocols, grey literature, surveillance data and preprint articles on COVID-19 in MedRxiv to evaluate if the association between ethnicity and clinical outcomes were reported and what they showed. PROSPERO:180654. Findings: Of 207 articles in the database search, five reported ethnicity; two reported no association between ethnicity and mortality. Of 690 articles identified from medical journals, 12 reported ethnicity; three reported no association between ethnicity and mortality. Of 209 preprints, 34 reported ethnicity – 13 found Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals had an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 12 reported worse clinical outcomes, including ITU admission and mortality, in BAME patients compared to White patients. Of 12 grey literature reports, seven with original data reported poorer clinical outcomes in BAME groups compared to White groups. Interpretation: Data on ethnicity in patients with COVID-19 in the published medical literature remains limited. However, emerging data from the grey literature and preprint articles suggest BAME individuals are at an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to White individuals and also worse clinical outcomes from COVID-19. Further work on the role of ethnicity in the current pandemic is of urgent public health importance.

232458,Learning From COVID-19 and Looking to Technology Ahead,2020,"Case fatality rate (CFR) is used to calculate mortality burden of COVID-19 under different scenarios, thus informing risk-benefit balance of interventions both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical. However, observed CFR is driven by testing: as more low-risk cases are identified, observed CFR will decline. This report quantifies test bias by modeling observed CFR as log-log-linear function of test density (tests per population) in 163 countries. CFR declined almost 20% (e.g. from 5% to 4%) for each doubling of test density (p < 0.0001); this association did not vary by continent (interaction p > 0.10) although at any given test density CFR was higher in Europe or North America than in Asia or Africa. This effect of test density on observed CFR is adequate to hide all but the largest true differences in case survivorship. Published estimates of CFR should specify test density, and comparisons should correct for it such as by applying the provided model.","Smith, Maia P",J Epidemiol Glob Health,,333

This should be done in a uniform and transparent way for the study programs of the Medical University of Graz. Methodology: We built on the Virtual Medical Campus, which has existed since 2003. For the summer semester 2020, we focused on an expansion of the automatic lecture recording system, microlearning and the implementation of video conferences as well as the learning platform LT. Results: The number of lecture recordings increased from 170 to more than 700, weekly accesses reached more than 80,000, with nearly 4,200 students. In the Microlearning system, an average of 82,516+-12,071 SEM learning steps per week were completed, which represented a highly significant increase compared to the same period of the previous year (15,101+-4,278 SEM; t-test: t=5,2638, p<0,0001). Video conferencing via WebEx was a newly introduced tool that was used extensively for interactive seminars, but also for oral exams. The LT platform from AdInstruments was successfully used as a replacement for practical training, especially in physiology. Conclusions: Based on sufficient preparatory work, a rapid expansion of e-learning ensured that teaching could be continued in the form of home learning despite the exceptional situation caused by COVID-19. Success factors were the provision of selected technical tools, consistent communication of the university management and technical and content support for teachers and students by a central staff unit.","Smolle, Josef; Rössler, Andreas; Rehatschek, Herwig; Hye, Florian; Vogl, Sabine",GMS J Med Educ,,333

234207,Evaluation of dermatology consultations in the era of COVID-19,2020,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disease for which an accurate, cost-effective prediction of motor function recovery is in pressing need. A plethora of neurochemical changes involved in the pathophysiological process of SCI may serve as a new source of biomarkers for patient outcomes. Five dogs were included in this study. We characterized the plasma cytokine profiles in acute phase (0, 1, and 3 days after SCI) and subacute phase (7, 14, and 21 days after SCI) with microarray analysis. The motor function recovery following SCI was monitored by Olby scores. The expression level of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then, correlations with the Olby scores and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed. We identified 12 DEPs including 10 pro-inflammatory and 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines during the 21-day study period. Among those, the expression levels of erythropoietin (EPO), IL-17A, and IFNÎ³ significantly correlated with the Olby scores with R2 values of 0.870, 0.740, and 0.616, respectively. The results of the ROC analysis suggested that plasma EPO, IL-17A, and IFNÎ³ exhibited a significant predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.656, 0.848, and 0.800 for EPO, IL-17A, and IFNÎ³, respectively. Our results provide a longitudinal description of the changes in plasma cytokine expression in the acute and subacute stages of canine SCI. These data reveal novel panels of inflammation-related cytokines which have the potential to be evaluated as biomarkers for predicting motor function prognosis after SCI.","Zhang, Lijian; Zhuang, Xiaoqing; Chen, Yao; Niu, Zhanfeng; Xia, Hechun",J. mol. neurosci,,333
235311,Challenges in Feeding Children Posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Systematic Review of Changes in Dietary Intake Combined with a Dietitian's Perspective,2021,"PURPOSE: With the COVID-19 crisis, recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) are necessary for protection in orthopaedics and traumatology. The primary purpose of this study is to review and present current evidence and recommendations for personal protective equipment and safety recommendations for orthopaedic surgeons and trauma surgeons. METHODS: A systematic review of the available literature was performed using the keyword terms ""COVID-19"", ""Coronavirus"", ""surgeon"", ""health-care workers"", ""protection"", ""masks"", ""gloves"", ""gowns"", ""helmets"", and ""aerosol"" in several combinations. The following databases were assessed: Pubmed, Cochrane Reviews, Google Scholar. Due to the paucity of available data, it was decided to present it in a narrative manner. In addition, participating doctors were asked to provide their guidelines for PPE in their countries (Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, UK) for consideration in the presented practice recommendations. RESULTS: World Health Organization guidance for respiratory aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as intubation in a COVID19 environment was clear and included the use of an FFP3 (filtering face piece level 3) mask and face protection. However, the recommendation for surgical AGPs, such as the use of high-speed power tools in the operating theatre, was not clear until the UK Public Health England (PHE) guidance of 27 March 2020. This guidance included FFP3 masks and face protection, which UK surgeons quickly adopted. The recommended PPE for orthopaedic surgeons, working in a COVID19 environment, should consist of level 4 surgical gowns, face shields or goggles, double gloves, FFP2-3 or N95-99 respirator masks. An alternative to the mask, face shield and goggles is a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly if the surgeons fail the mask fit test or are required to undertake a long procedure. However, there is a high cost and limited availabilty of these devices at present. Currently available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a permeable top for air intake. During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids contain virus particles. Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used during orthopaedic surgery. In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regard.

It was however presumed that extreme preventive measures of entire lockdown in India might have reduced the air pollution level and therefore decreased the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) daily AOD product was deployed to investigate the change in AOD level during lockdown phases across the Indian Territory as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000-2019) of the same periods. The key findings of the study revealed that AOD level over the Indian Territory is greatly reduced (~45%) during the lockdown periods as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000-2019). Furthermore, a noteworthy negative AOD anomaly (~6 to 37%) was observed across the four metropolitan cities in India during the entire lockdown period (25th March to 15th May 2020). However, coal mining regions of the various coalfields in India showed a positive anomaly (~+11 to 40%) during the lockdown periods due to ongoing mining operations. In a nutshell, the study results indicated a huge drop in the AOD level over Indian Territory during lockdown periods. It is expected that the pandemic can influence some policy decisions to propose air pollution control methods. Lockdown events possibly may play a crucial role as a potential solution for air pollution abatement in the future. It may not be uncommon in future when the governments may implement deliberately selective lockdowns at pollution hotspots to control the pollution level.","Ranjan, Avinash Kumar; Patra, A K; Gorai, A K",Sci Total Environ,,333
238424,Covid-19 and Tuberculosis Are Still with Us,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is novel corona virus infection outbreak that has gone global in 2020. Current prevention policies consist of hand hygiene and social distancing. Emergencies overloaded health services and shocked the logistics chains in many countries, especially Italy and China. Having more than a quarter of its population being elderly, Japan is at high risk for COVID-19 induced morbidity and mortality. This situation cancelled schedules of all routine group exercise activities for the seniors in Japan. While the outbreak is ongoing, staying at home is safe. However, successive days of being house-ridden and limited movement can lead to excessive physical inactivity. Some elderly who are not moving much can lose a significant amount of muscle strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity. It can accelerate the frailty and dependency of the seniors, and subsequently, claiming of care and health services. Moreover, existing and new evidences showed that physical activity can promote antiviral immunity. An alternative to usual group exercise activities is crucial to keep seniors active without affecting social distancing. While staying at home for long, functional exercises maintaining basic level of physical activity and movements are urgently required to be introduced to the seniors in Tokyo and around the world to prevent functional decline. Home exercise is a practical option. Therefore, we made a home-version of the functional training exercise video with different sets of 10-minutes exercise for 7 days a week. This breakthrough alternative may sustain health promotion for the elderly persons to preserve their active aging and maintain optimal health.","Aung, Myo Nyein; Yuasa, Motoyuki; Koyanagi, Yuka; Aung, Thin Nyein Nyein; Moolphate, Saiyud; Matsumoto, Hiromichi; Yoshioka, Takashi",J Infect Dev Ctries,,333

However, the origin of excessive damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is able to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damages in vitro and in vivo. 2-E proteins were found to form a type of pH-sensitive cation channels in bilayer lipid membranes. As observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, heterologous expression of 2-E channels induced rapid cell death in various susceptible cell types and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damages in lung and spleen. A dominant negative mutation lowering 2-E channel activity attenuated cell death and SARS-CoV-2 production. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent cell protective activity in vitro and these activities were positively correlated with inhibition of 2-E channel. Importantly, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of the channel inhibitor effectively reduced both the viral load and secretion of inflammation cytokines in lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). Our study supports that 2-E is a promising drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","Xia, Bingqing; Shen, Xurui; He, Yang; Pan, Xiaoyan; Liu, Feng-Liang; Wang, Yi; Yang, Feipu; Fang, Sui; Wu, Yan; Duan, Zilei; Zuo, Xiaoli; Xie, Zhuqing; Jiang, Xiangrui; Xu, Ling; Chi, Hao; Li, Shuangqu; Meng, Qian; Zhou, Hu; Zhou, Yubo; Cheng, Xi; Xin, Xiaoming; Jin, Lin; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Yu, Dan-Dan; Li, Ming-Hua; Feng, Xiao-Li; Chen, Jiekai; Jiang, Hualiang; Xiao, Gengfu; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Shen, Jingshan; Li, Jia; Gao, Zhaobing",Cell Res,,333

The 2019-nCOV belongs to the Coronaviridae family, principally consists of virulent pathogens showing zoonotic property, has emerged as a pandemic outbreak with high mortality and high morbidity rate around the globe and no therapeutic vaccine or drugs against 2019-nCoV are discovered till now. In this study, in silico methods and algorithms were used for sequence, structure analysis and molecular docking on Mpro of 2019-nCOV. The co-crystal structure of 2019-nCOV protease, 6LU7 have â¼99% identity with SARS-CoV protease. The 6LU7 residues, Cys145 and His164 are playing a significant role in replication and are essential for the survival of 2019-nCOV. Alongside, 2019-nCOV Mpro sequence is non-homologous to human host-pathogen. Complete genome sequence analysis, structural and molecular docking results revealed that Remdesivir is having a better binding affinity with -8.2 kcal/mol than the rest of protease inhibitors, and peptide. Remdesivir is strongly forming h-bonds with crucial Mpro residues, Cys145, and His164. Further, MD simulation analysis also confirmed, that these residues are forming H-bond with Remdesivir during 100 ns simulations run and found stable (â¼99%) by RMSD and RMSF. Thus, present in silico study at molecular approaches suggest that, Remdesivir is a potent therapeutic inhibitor against 2019-nCoV.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Materials and Methods Robotic nephrectomy was performed on sample group of five gilts using the EDGE SP1000 single-port robotic system. The continuous vital signs of all gilts were monitored throughout the operation to examine the safety of the operation. Data regarding surgical complications and technical difficulties throughout the operation were recorded for future evaluation. Lastly, the survival of the sample gilts two weeks after the operation were recorded. Results The robotic assisted nephrectomy yielded an impressive result that all sample gilts successfully survived after two weeks. Furthermore, there is no surgical complications nor technical difficulties were encountered during the operation. The average duration to establish the operation channel was 12.4 ± 1.52 min, the average time taken to install EDGE SP1000 single-port robotic system was 2.8 ± 0.84 min, the average time to dissociate and remove the kidney was 47 ± 5.61 min, and average total operational duration was 71 ± 5.24 min. Most importantly, the surgeon and assistant who were using the system, found it convenient and performed excellently during the operation. Conclusions This study shows that the EDGE SP1000 single-port robotic surgical system is safe and feasible for the use of nephrectomy in gilts. Our further work will expand the application of the EDGE SP1000 system to other urological procedures and accumulate more preclinical data for further clinical trial.","Liu, Cheng; Lai, Cong; Yao, Xuefeng; Kuiqing, Li; Wang, Jianchen; Huang, Jian; Xu, Kewei",J. endourol,,333
244627,Tablet-based patient educational interventions in care and management of complex movement disorders,2021,"In this paper, we introduce the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) as an enabler for semantics-empowered communication, a newly advocated communication paradigm centered around data's role and its usefulness to the communication's goal. First, we shed light on how the traditional communication paradigm, with its role-blind approach to data, is vulnerable to performance bottlenecks. Next, we highlight the shortcomings of several proposed performance measures destined to deal with the traditional communication paradigm's limitations, namely the Age of Information (AoI) and the error-based metrics. We also show how the AoII addresses these shortcomings and captures more meaningfully the purpose of data. Afterward, we consider the problem of minimizing the average AoII in a transmitter-receiver pair scenario where packets are sent over an unreliable channel subject to a transmission rate constraint. We prove that the optimal transmission strategy is a randomized threshold policy, and we propose a low complexity algorithm that finds both the optimal threshold and the randomization parameter. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical comparison between the AoII framework and the standard error-based metrics counterpart. Interestingly, we show that the AoII-optimal policy is also error-optimal for the adopted information source model. At the same time, the converse is not necessarily true. Finally, we implement our proposed policy in various real-life applications, such as video streaming, and we showcase its performance advantages compared to both the error-optimal and the AoI-optimal policies.","Maatouk, Ali; Assaad, Mohamad; Ephremides, Anthony",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13214v2.pdf,333

(Research Theme: COVID-19 pandemic.),2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic challenged program leaders to respond rapidly to changes in health care delivery, protect trainee safety, and transform educational activities. The pandemic demanded that program directors prioritize and address myriad threats to trainees' well-being. In this paper, we adapt Maslow's needs framework to systematically address trainee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential interventions to meet trainee needs at the program, institution, and extrainstitutional levels. Transforming education to effectively respond to trainee well-being needs requires leadership, and we use Kotter's 8-step change management model as an example of a framework to effectively lead change. Program leaders can take this opportunity to reflect upon their training programs and take the opportunity to improve them. Some of the systems of education we develop during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as telehealth, tele-education, and ways to stay connected may provide advantages and will be important to continue and expand upon post-COVID-19.","Weiss, Pnina G; Li, Su-Ting T",Acad Pediatr,,333

METHODS: Prospective study based on the SNOT-22, item ""sense of smell or taste"" and additional outcomes. RESULTS: 268/315 patients (85.1%) completing the survey at baseline also completed the follow-up interview. The 12 months prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 associated chemosensory dysfunction was 21.3% (95% CI 16.5-26.7%). Of the 187 patients who complained of COVID-19 associated chemosensory dysfunction at baseline, 130 (69.5%; 95% CI 62.4-76.0%) reported complete resolution of smell or taste impairment, 41 (21.9%) reported a decrease in the severity, and 16 (8.6%) reported the symptom was unchanged or worse 1 year after onset.

Considering the current knowledge on the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of COVID-19, it is safe to state that both COVID-19 and inflammatory rheumatic disorders cause a cytokine storm and merit treatment with anti-rheumatic drugs. Three patients, who were on regular follow-up due to the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), contracted COVID-19 infection; and their pre-clinical and post-clinical data as well as laboratory, prognosis and treatment data were investigated. Effects of colchicine in FMF patients who contracted COVID-19 infection were presented in this study. All the cases recovered from COVID-19 without complications. The present study suggests that colchicine can positively affect the prognosis of COVID-19 in FMF patients; therefore, experience of rheumatologists in the use of anti-inflammatory drugs can be highly instrumental in management of COVID-19 patients.","Nas, Kemal; Eryilmaz, Nuran; Geyik, Mehmet Faruk; Altas, Ayfer",Rheumatol Int,,333

250410,Impact of COVID-19 outbreak in acute bronchiolitis: Lesson from a tertiary Italian Emergency Department,2021,"Activation of the RIG-I-like receptors, retinoic-acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), establishes an antiviral state by upregulating interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Among these is ISG15, the mechanistic roles of which in innate immunity still remain enigmatic. In the present study, we report that ISG15 conjugation is essential for antiviral IFN responses mediated by the viral RNA sensor MDA5. ISGylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domains of MDA5 promotes its oligomerization and thereby triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses, including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses. The ISG15-dependent activation of MDA5 is antagonized through direct de-ISGylation mediated by the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work demonstrates a crucial role for ISG15 in the MDA5-mediated antiviral response, and also identifies a key immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which may be targeted for the development of new antivirals and vaccines to combat COVID-19.","Liu, GuanQun; Lee, Jung-Hyun; Parker, Zachary M; Acharya, Dhiraj; Chiang, Jessica J; van Gent, Michiel; Riedl, William; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E; Wies, Effi; Chiang, Cindy; Gack, Michaela U",Nat Microbiol,,333

However, only a few cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate a case of concomitant GBS with COVID-19 in Colombia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 39-year-old woman was admitted to a teaching hospital in Barranquilla, Colombia with a history of progressive general weakness with lower limb dominance. Previous symptoms such as ageusia, anosmia and intense headache were reported. Upon admission, facial diplegia, quadriparesis with lower extremity predominance and Medical Research Council muscular strength of 2/5 in the lower limbs and 4/5 in the upper limbs were reported. During clinical evolution, due to general areflexia, hypertensive emergency and progressive diaphragmatic weakness, the patient was admitted to an intensive care unit. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed protein-cytological dissociation and the GBS diagnosis was confirmed via a nerve conduction and electromyography test. With regard to the symptoms before hospitalisation, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was performed with positive results in the second test. The patient was managed with supportive care and was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Only a few cases of COVID-19 with GBS have been reported. Different subtypes have been previously identified, such as Miller-Fisher syndrome and dysautonomic GBS with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study investigated the first confirmed case of COVID-19 with concomitant GBS in Colombia. In patients with GBS, several viral and bacterial pathogens have been found in case-control studies but the factors that induce the immune-mediated destruction of the nerve tissues have not been determined. Further studies are needed to determine the possible association between COVID-19 exposure and GBS.","Mackenzie, Nuvia; Lopez-Coronel, Eva; Dau, Alberto; Maloof, Dieb; Mattar, Salvador; Garcia, Jesus Tapia; Fontecha, Briyis; Lanata, Cristina M; Guillen-Burgos, Hernan Felipe",BMC Neurol,,333

This study identifies comorbidities that predict death among a large sample of COVID-19 patients from Nigeria. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of medical records for 2184 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Lagos, southwest Nigeria. Extracted data included age, sex, severity of condition at presentation and self-reported comorbidities. The outcomes of interest were death or discharge from facility. RESULTS: Most of the cases were male (65.8%) and the median age was 43 years (IQR: 33-55). Four hundred and ninety-two patients (22.5%) had at least one comorbidity and the most common amongst them were hypertension (74.2%) and diabetes (30.3%). The mortality rate was 3.3% and a significantly higher proportion of patients with comorbidities died compared to those with none. The comorbidities that predicted death were hypertension (OR: 2.21, 95%CI: 1.22-4.01), diabetes (OR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.99-6.85), renal disease (OR: 12.53, 95%CI: 1.97-79.56), cancer (OR: 14.12, 95% CI: 2.03-98.19) and HIV (OR: 1.77-84.15].

251946,The paleopathological evidence on the origins of human tuberculosis: a review,2020,"Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to identify its genetic diversity. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

A new model structure is proposed with segmentation of anatomical structures on DNNs-based (deep learning neural network) methods, relying on an abundance of labeled data for proper training. The model improves the existing techniques used for CT images inspection through an application of Stacked Autoencoders (SAEs) structures using the segmentation function for the area object detection model on Fast-RCNN. As a result, the proposed approach can quickly analyze X-ray images in detecting abnormalities in patients with lab-confirmed coronavirus even before clinical symptoms appear. In addition to detecting early abnormalities, area object detection model reveals a finding not seen in the latest cases of COVID-19. Most noteworthy, the study has shown that all COVID-19 patients exhibit an associated bilateral pleural effusion. The features are augmented to the model for the improvement of detection quality improvement and the shorten of the examination period.","Chen, Z. H.; Juang, J.

The city of Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, China, is responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness known as COVID 19 and it has been rapidly spread across the world claiming millions of lives. The sudden outbreak of novel Coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV), is a big concern for their speedy mitigation using the predictable treatment and creating its approach around the world. Researchers and doctors are in search of rapid diagnosis kit, drugs, and viral-resistant personal protective equipment (PPE) to clinical diagnosis, medication, and prevent the spread of COVID 19. A rational approach with adaptability and broad viewpoint to challenge the growing pain could be overcome by the application of appropriate technology. The nanotechnology-based approach can significantly serve the purpose of the current pandemic situation of COVID 19. But same time implementation of innovative and creative nanotech approach, there is a decisive need for the full knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Moreover, to defeat COVID 19, particularly nanotech-based system with their viral inhibitory properties to increase the effective nanotech approach is essential. In this scenario, this review aims to summarize the past, present, and future of nanotech-based systems that can be used to treat COVID 19, highlighting Nano-based compounds. Lastly, the potential application of the different category of Inorganic Nanomaterials/Inorganic organic conjugate /hybrid system and their practical applicability as suitable means for inspiring against COVID 19 has also been discussed.","Shukla, Brijesh Kumar Tyagi Himanshi Bhandari Hema Garg Seema",Macromolecular Symposia,,333

Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 appears to be lower than that of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the total fatality to surpass other viral diseases, reaching more than 1 million globally as of October 6, 2020. The rate at which the disease is spreading calls for a therapy that is useful for treating a large population. Multiple intersecting viral and host factor targets involved in the life cycle of the virus are being explored. Because of the frequent mutations, many coronaviruses gain zoonotic potential, which is dependent on the presence of cell receptors and proteases, and therefore the targeting of the viral proteins has some drawbacks, as strain-specific drug resistance can occur. Moreover, the limited number of proteins in a virus makes the number of available targets small. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share common mechanisms of entry and replication, there are substantial differences in viral proteins such as the spike (S) protein. In contrast, targeting cellular factors may result in a broader range of therapies, reducing the chances of developing drug resistance. In this Review, we discuss the role of primary host factors such as the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cellular proteases of S protein priming, post-translational modifiers, kinases, inflammatory cells, and their pharmacological intervention in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.","Tharappel, Anil Mathew; Samrat, Subodh Kumar; Li, Zhong; Li, Hongmin",ACS Infect Dis,,333
255811,"Letter to the Editor ""Changes to Neurosurgery Resident Education Since Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic""",2020,"For last months, humanity has faced a formidable unknown enemy, which is presented as a new coronavirus infection. Despite the fact that the causative agents of new diseases appear at a certain frequency and that the virus SARS-CoV-2 has certain common properties with its predecessors, at the moment we are dealing with a new unknown pathogenesis of the development of severe complications in patients with risk factors. A final understanding of pathological process mechanisms is the goal of the scientific community. Summarizing research data from different countries, it became obvious that in severe cases of viral infection, we are dealing with a combination of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Thrombotic microangiopathy is represented by a group of different conditions in which thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiple organ failure occur. The article reflects the main types of TMA, pathogenesis and principles of therapy. The main participants in the process are described in detail, including the von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS-13. Based on the knowledge available, as well as new data obtained from patients with COVID-19, we proposed possible models for the implementation of conditions such as sepsis, TMA, and DIC in patients with severe new coronavirus infection. Through a deeper understanding of pathogenesis, it will be possible to develop more effective diagnosis and therapy.","Makatsariya, A D; Slukhanchuk, E V; Bitsadze, V O; Khizroeva, J K H; Tretyakova, M V; Tsibizova, V I; Elalamy, I; Gris, J-C; Grandone, E; Makatsariya, N A; Mashkova, T",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,333

257111,Surgical Training during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preparing for Future Uncertainty,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit not only respiratory symptoms but also symptoms of chemo-sensitive disorders. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins using immunohistochemistry, in the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, and lung of rats. RESULTS: Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the taste buds of the tongue, nasal epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, and alveoli with varying degrees of expression. Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was more distinct in the peripheral alveoli than in the central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, and respiratory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Differential distribution of TMPRSS2 in the lung indicated the COVID-19 symptoms to possibly be exacerbated by TMPRSS2 expression. This study might provide potential clues for further investigation of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in November-19 in Wuhan, China. The preventive measures taken did not prevent the rapid spread of the virus to all countries around the world. To date, there are about 2.54 million deaths, effective vaccines are in clinical trials. SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 protein as an intracellular gateway. ACE-2 is a key component of the Renin Angiotensin (RAS) system, a key regulator of cardiovascular function. Considering the key role of ACE-2 in COVID-19 infection, both as an entry receptor and as a protective role, especially for the respiratory tract, and considering the variations of ACE-2 and ACE during the stages of viral infection, it is clear the important role that the pharmacological regulation of RAS and ACE-2 can assume. This biological knowledge suggests different pharmacological approaches to treat COVID-19 by modulating RAS, ACE-2 and the ACE/ACE2 balance that we describe in this article.","Ferrara, F; Vitiello, A",Cardiovasc Toxicol,,333

These include non-specific symptoms (e.g., headaches and fatigue) which were found to be affected by psychological processes in other disorders (e.g., post-concussion syndrome, PCS, after mild traumatic brain injury). The current study assessed the impact of diagnosis threat (i.e., information regarding the long-term neurological impact of COVID-19) and suggestibility on endorsed symptoms of both recovered patients and healthy controls. Method: Recovered patients (nâ¯=â¯90) and healthy controls (nâ¯=â¯210) described their cognitive functioning after being randomly assigned to: (a) Experimental group: These participants read an article that explored long-term neurological symptoms among COVID-19 survivors. (b) Control group: These participants read an article providing general information regarding the disease. Results: Recovered patients, but not healthy controls, endorsed more symptoms in the experimental condition compared to the control condition. Moreover, suggestibility was correlated with endorsement of symptoms. Conclusions: Post COVID-19 neurological symptoms may, at least partially, be affected by non-neurological factors such as diagnosis threat. Information regarding long-term effects of COVID-19 may skew reported symptoms with highly suggestible individuals particularly susceptible to these effects. Further research, however, is needed to validate and elaborate upon these initial findings.","Winter, Daniella; Braw, Yoram",Int J Clin Health Psychol,,333

This brief review provides an overview about some aspects of the placental pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 11 papers were included. The current literature suggests that there are no specific histopathological characteristics in the placenta related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but placentas from infected women are more likely to show findings of maternal and/or fetal malperfusion. The most common findings in placentas from infected women were fibrin deposition and intense recruitment of inflammatory infiltrates. The transplacental transmission of this virus is unlikely to occur, probably due to low expression of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in placental cell types. Further studies are needed to improve our knowledge about the interaction between the virus and the mother-fetus dyad and the impact on maternal and neonatal/fetal outcomes.","Leal, Caio Ribeiro Vieira; Maciel, Rayra Amana Macêdo; Corrêa Júnior, Mário Dias",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,,333

This has led to an increase in the interest of studying relevant cardiovascular variables, in order to establish their association with clinical outcomes in this population. Objective: To describe the prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers in disease caused by COVID-19. Methods: A non-systematic review of the literature was carried out in data bases that included PubMed, Google Scholar, Clinical Key, SciELO, using the key words, plain terms, and MeSH terms. Results: A total of 22 articles were chosen. They consisted of review articles on the subject, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, observational studies, and original articles published up until 13 May 2020. The majority of them described the changes in cardiac biomarkers and their relationship with the clinical outcome of patients COVID-19. Discussion: It was found that Troponin and Natriuretic Peptide behaved as independent risk factors for severe clinical compromise, requiring ventilatory or haemodynamic support, admission to ICU, and an increase in mortality. Conclusions: It is reasonable to recommend the use of these biomarkers in the risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 and an established cardiovascular disease.","Ocampo-Salgado, Carolina; Palacio-Uribe, Jorge; Duque-Ramírez, Mauricio; Orrego-Garay, María José",Rev.

Structural Equation Model Analysis,2021,"PURPOSE: To report four cases of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with high blood concentrations of neutralizing autoantibodies against type I interferons (IFNs), who were treated with plasma exchange (PE) as a rescue therapy. METHODS: Prospective case series, which included patients, diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and positive autoantibodies against type I IFNs in two French intensive care units (ICUs) between October 8 and November 14, 2020. Six critically ill COVID-19 patients with no anti-IFN antibodies were used as controls. Anti-IFN autoantibodies and IFN concentrations, together with the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, were measured sequentially in serum. Viral load was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Patients were followed during hospital stay. RESULTS: Three men and one woman were included. Three of the patients had four PE sessions each, while another had three PE sessions. PE decreased the concentrations of autoantibodies against type I IFN in all four patients, whereas anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels remained stable. Autoantibodies against type I IFN levels were high in tracheal aspirates of one patient and decreased after three PE sessions. By contrast, anti-IFN autoantibodies were not detected in tracheal aspirates from five control patients without detectable anti-IFN autoantibodies in serum. During PE, serum IFN-&#945; levels slightly increased in three out of four patients, and upper respiratory tract viral load decreased in all patients. All patients were alive at day 28 of ICU admission. Two patients eventually died in the ICU, while the two survivors were discharged from the ICU at days 50 and 66. CONCLUSIONS: PE efficiently removes autoantibodies against type I IFNs, including those detected in tracheal aspirates, without affecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical benefit of PE in patients with autoantibodies against type I IFNs should be tested in a larger study.","de Prost, Nicolas; Bastard, Paul; Arrestier, Romain; Fourati, Slim; Mahévas, Mathieu; Burrel, Sonia; Dorgham, Karim; Gorochov, Guy; Tandjaoui-Lambiotte, Yacine; Azzaoui, Iname; Fernandes, Ignacio; Combes, Alain; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Mekontso-Dessap, Armand; Luyt, Charles-Edouard",J Clin Immunol,,333

Denmark and Sweden adopted different COVID-19 management strategies. Aim: This study aimed to compare search strategies, perceptions and effects of COVID-19 information, in general and specifically in social media, in residents in Denmark and Sweden. Subject and methods: Quantitative data from a sample of respondents (n = 616) from Denmark and Sweden on an international web-based survey was analysed using descriptive and analytical statistics. Results: The results showed similarities between the countries regarding preferred and trusted information sources, use of (social) media, and psychosocial and behavioural effects of such information. Traditional media and social media were frequently used for COVID-19 information. Especially health authorities and researchers were trusted sources, representing the dominant medico-political discourse. There were no differences in negative effect and social behaviour. Residents in Denmark experienced significantly more positive effects than residents in Sweden. Conclusion: Summarily, the study showed similarities and small differences among residents in both countries related to usage patterns, perceptions and effects of COVID-19 information from (social) media, despite diverging strategies.","Stjernswärd, Sigrid; Ivert, Anna-Karin; Glasdam, Stinne",Z Gesundh Wiss,,333

We aimed to examine the psychological impact of the MCO among clinical undergraduates. A cross-sectional study was conducted using self-reported questionnaires that were distributed online using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS 21), Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS), and the newly designed MCO effect questionnaire. Seven hundred seventy-two students completed the survey. The prevalence of psychological distress was 52.8%, with around 60% of respondents reporting disruption to their daily lives. Older (p = 0.015) and more senior students (p < 0.001) were less likely to be anxious than their younger and junior counterparts, respectively. A greater number of social support (three or more) was linked to a lower score of depression (p = 0.005) and stress (p = 0.045). Undergraduates who received family support demonstrated lower depression scores (p = 0.037) and higher mental wellbeing (p = 0.020) compared to those without. Government support was independently associated with a lesser risk of depressive symptoms (Adjusted odds ratio, AOR 0.68; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.47-0.99) and a greater sense of mental wellbeing (AOR 1.54; 95% CI 1.06-2.22). The present finding provides evidence of a high prevalence of psychological distress among clinical undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate social support is important in alleviating anxiety and stress and promoting greater mental wellbeing amongst students during the nationwide quarantine.","Kalok, Aida; Sharip, Shalisah; Abdul Hafizz, Abdul Muzhill; Zainuddin, Zulkifli Md; Shafiee, Mohamad Nasir",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,333

270929,Perspectives on the recommendations for skin cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Although COVID-19 is known to be caused by human-to-human transmission, it remains largely unclear whether ambient air pollutants and meteorological parameters could promote its transmission. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to study whether air quality index (AQI), four ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO) and five meteorological variables (daily temperature, highest temperature, lowest temperature, temperature difference and sunshine duration) could increase COVID-19 incidence in Wuhan and XiaoGan between Jan 26th to Feb 29th in 2020. RESULTS: First, a significant correlation was found between COVID-19 incidence and AQI in both Wuhan (R2=0.13, p<0.05) and XiaoGan (R2=0.223, p<0.01). Specifically, among four pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was prominently correlated with PM2.5 and NO2 in both cities. In Wuhan, the tightest correlation was observed between NO2 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.329, p<0.01). In XiaoGan, in addition to the PM2.5 (R2=0.117, p<0.01) and NO2 (R2=0.015, p<0.05), a notable correlation was also observed between the PM10 and COVID-19 incidence (R2=0.105, p<0.05). Moreover, temperature is the only meteorological parameter that constantly correlated well with COVID-19 incidence in both Wuhan and XiaoGan, but in an inverse correlation (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AQI, PM2.5, NO2, and temperature are four variables that could promote the sustained transmission of COVID-19.","Li, He; Xu, Xiao-Long; Dai, Da-Wei; Huang, Zhen-Yu; Ma, Zhuang; Guan, Yan-Jun",Int J Infect Dis,,333

Data visualisations and models related to the spread of the disease became ubiquitous. In this paper, we survey 25 different data analytics dashboards, highlight the modelling approach taken by each, and develop a multi-attribute utility theory model to assess their effectiveness in communicating key features that explain the spread of infectious disease. We show that the dashboards that feature dimensions that span the categories associated with compartmental epidemiology models tend to be relatively robust data visualisations, and we highlight that information systems need to be improved to include data on actions to reduce the spread of the disease. We analyse the actions taken by countries around the world and show that when governments employ strict measures early, particularly those that enforce social distancing and include widespread testing and comprehensive contact tracing, they are more likely to experience better outcomes. Recommendations for how countries should respond in future pandemics are detailed.","Pietz, Jesse; McCoy, Scott; Wilck, JosephH.",Eur. J. Inf. Syst.,,333

The H NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy studies showed that in nonpolar solvents, the amphiphiles formed reverse micelles in which the hydrophilic imidazole heads aggregated inside the micelles through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and the nonpolar alkyl chains were located at the periphery of the micelles. In concentrated solutions, they formed lyotropic liquid crystals having columnar hexagonal structures. The molecules were arranged in a disk hydrogen bonding between successive imidazole moieties. When dilute solutions of the amphiphiles in -hexane (0.1 wt%) were spin-coated on to a plasma-cleaned Si wafer, a band-like structure with a width of 60-100 nm was imaged by AFM. Microscopic fiber bundles with a diameter as large as 13 µm were observed by SEM when the lyotropic liquid crystals in 30 wt% hexane solution were dried on the glass.","Seo, Sang Hyuk; Tew, Gregory N; Chang, Ji Young",Soft Matter,,333

Survey among primary care physicians,2020,"BACKGROUND: Most patients including health care workers (HCWs) survived the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, knowledge about the sequelae of COVID-19 after discharge remains limited. METHODS: A prospectively observational 3-month follow-up study evaluated symptoms, dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG and IgM, lung function, and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of survivors of COVID-19 after discharge at Wuhan Union Hospital, China. RESULTS: Seventy-six survivors (55 females) with a mean age of 41.3 ± 13.8 years were enrolled, and 65 (86%) were HCWs. A total of 69 (91%) patients had returned to their original work at 3-months after discharge. Most of the survivors had symptoms including fever, sputum production, fatigue, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness on exertion and palpitations in the three months after discharge. The serum troponin-I levels during the acute illness showed high correlation with the symptom of fatigue after hospital discharge (r = 0.782; P = 0.008) and lymphopenia was correlated with the symptoms of chest tightness and palpitations on exertion of patients after hospital discharge (r = -.285, P = 0.027; r = -.363, P = 0.004, respectively). The mean values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity and diffusion capacity were all normal (> 80% predicted) and lung HRCTs returned to normal in most of the patients (82%), however, 42% of survivors had mild pulmonary function abnormalities at 3-months after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 IgG turned negative in 11% (6 of 57 patients), 8% (4 of 52 patients) and 13% (7 of 55 patients), and SARS-CoV-2 IgM turned negative in 72% (41 of 57 patients), 85% (44 of 52 patients) and 87% (48 of 55 patients) at 1-month, 2-months and 3-months after discharge, respectively. CONCLUSION: Infection by SARS-CoV-2 caused some mild impairments of survivors within the first three months of their discharge and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was limited, which indicates the necessity of long-term follow-up of survivors of COVID-19.","Liang, Limei; Yang, Bohan; Jiang, Nanchuan; Fu, Wei; He, Xinliang; Zhou, Yaya; Ma, Wan Li; Wang, Xiaorong",J Korean Med Sci,,333

The ability of L. plantarum to express viral antigens, including the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its capacity to differentially modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses in both the intestinal and respiratory mucosa after its oral administration, indicates the potential of this LAB to be used in the development of a mucosal COVID-19 vaccine.","Villena, Julio; Li, Chang; Vizoso-Pinto, Maria Guadalupe; Sacur, Jacinto; Ren, Linzhu; Kitazawa, Haruki",,,333
275793,Medical Mistrust and Stigma Associated with COVID-19 Among People Living with HIV in South Africa,2021,"Background Previous works seem to agree in the higher mortality of cancer patients with COVID-19. Identifying potential prognostic factors upon admission could help identify patients with a poor prognosis. Methods We aimed to explore the characteristics and evolution of COVID-19 cancer patients admitted to hospital in a multicenter international registry (HOPE COVID-19). Our primary objective is to define those characteristics that allow us to identify cancer patients with a worse prognosis (mortality within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19). Results 5838 patients have been collected in this registry, of whom 770 had cancer among their antecedents. In hospital mortality reached 258 patients (33.51%). The median was 75 years (65–82). Regarding the distribution by sex, 34.55% of the patients (266/770) were women. The distribution by type of cancer: genitourinary 238/745 (31.95%), digestive 124/745 (16.54%), hematologic 95/745 (12.75%). In multivariate regression analysis, factors that are independently associated with mortality at admission are: renal impairment (OR 3.45, CI 97.5% 1.85–6.58), heart disease (2.32, 1.47–3.66), liver disease (4.69, 1.94–11.62), partial dependence (2.41, 1.34–4.33), total dependence (7.21, 2.60–21.82), fatigue (1.84, 1.16–2.93), arthromialgias (0.45, 0.26–0.78), SatO2 Conclusion In patients with cancer from the HOPE registry, 30-day mortality from any cause is high and is associated with easily identifiable clinical factors upon arrival at the hospital. Identifying these patients can help initiate more intensive treatments from the start and evaluate the prognosis of these patients.","Pérez-Segura, Pedro Paz-Cabezas M.; Núñez-Gil, I.

275849,Patient Use and Clinical Practice Patterns of Remote Cardiology Clinic Visits in the Era of COVID-19,2021,"CONTEXT: Lymphopenia is a key feature of immune dysfunction in patients with bacterial sepsis and COVID-19 and associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the cause is largely unknown. Severely ill patients may present with thyroid function abnormalities, so-called non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and several studies have linked TSH and the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) to homeostatic regulation and function of lymphocyte populations. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of absolute lymphocyte counts, circulating TSH, T4, free T4 (FT4), T3, albumin and inflammatory biomarkers was performed in two independent hospitalized study populations: bacterial sepsis (n=224) and COVID-19 patients (n=161). A subgroup analysis was performed in patients with severe lymphopenia and normal lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Only T3 significantly correlated (rho=0.252) with lymphocyte counts in patients with bacterial sepsis and lower concentrations were found in severe lymphopenic compared to non-lympopenic patients (n=56 per group). Severe lymphopenic COVID-19 patients (n=17) showed significantly lower plasma concentrations of TSH, T4, FT4 and T3 compared to patients without lymphopenia (n=18), and demonstrated significantly increased values of the inflammatory markers interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and ferritin. Remarkably, after one week follow-up, the majority (12/15) of COVID-19 patients showed quantitative recovery of their lymphocyte numbers, while TSH and thyroid hormones remained mainly disturbed. CONCLUSION: Abnormal thyroid function correlates with lymphopenia in patients with severe infections, like bacterial sepsis and COVID-19, but future studies need to establish whether a causal relationship is involved.","Grondman, Inge; de Nooijer, Aline H; Antonakos, Nikolaos; Janssen, Nico A F; Mouktaroudi, Maria; Leventogiannis, Konstantinos; Medici, Marco; Smit, Jan W A; van Herwaarden, Antonius E; Joosten, Leo A B; van der Veerdonk, Frank L; Pickkers, Peter; Kox, Matthijs; Jaeger, Martin; Netea, Mihai G; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Netea-Maier, Romana T",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,333
275850,Patient Use and Clinical Practice Patterns of Remote Cardiology Clinic Visits in the Era of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The use of face masks by children for the prevention of COVID 19 is still controversial, especially with regards to who should wear the face mask and at what age. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to ascertain the perception of mothers on masking in children as a preventive strategy for COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in two health institutions among 387 mothers who presented with their children for the first time in the hospital during the COVID 19 pandemic. A pretested, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire which was designed by the researchers was used for data collection. RESULTS: Minority (44.7%) of the mothers perceived masking in children as an appropriate measure for the prevention of COVID-19. The frequent reasons given by majority (55.3%) of the mothers for the inappropriateness of face mask in children included perceived difficulty in breathing (38.5%) and the child's readiness to pull it off (29.3%). A significantly higher proportion of the children whose mothers were 35 years and above, 64.2% would wear face masks when compared with 31.7% of those whose mothers were < 30 years of age (&#967;2 = 28.632, p<0.001). Similarly, a significantly higher proportion (51.0%) of the children who were more than one year of age would wear a face mask when compared with 20.5% of those aged eight days to one year (&#967;2 = 19.441, p<0.001). The children whose mothers were <30 years were about four times less likely to wear a face mask when compared with those whose mothers were aged 35 years and above. (AOR = 0.273; 95%CI: 0.155-0.478). The children whose fathers have attained tertiary education were about twice less likely to wear face masks when compared with those whose fathers have attained secondary education and less. (AOR = 0.554; 95%CI: 0.334-0.919). Mothers' perception of COVID-19 had no significant influence on children's use of face mask (&#967;2 = 2.337, p = 0.127). CONCLUSION: Maternal perception of masking in children as an appropriate strategy for preventing COVID-19 is adjudged low in this study. Right perception is significantly enhanced by maternal educational status, employment and marital status.","Aronu, Ann E; Chinawa, Josephat M; Nduagubam, Obinna C; Ossai, Edmund N; Chinawa, Awoere T; Igwe, Wilson C",PLoS One,,333

278811,Management of patients with Behçet's disease during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several small studies on patients with COVID-19 and haematological malignancies are available showing a high mortality in this population. The Italian Hematology Alliance on COVID-19 aimed to collect data from adult patients with haematological malignancies who required hospitalisation for COVID-19. METHODS: This multicentre, retrospective, cohort study included adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with diagnosis of a WHO-defined haematological malignancy admitted to 66 Italian hospitals between Feb 25 and May 18, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed and symptomatic COVID-19. Data cutoff for this analysis was June 22, 2020. The primary outcome was mortality and evaluation of potential predictive parameters of mortality. We calculated standardised mortality ratios between observed death in the study cohort and expected death by applying stratum-specific mortality rates of the Italian population with COVID-19 and an Italian cohort of 31â993 patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19 (data up to March 1, 2019). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify factors associated with overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352556, and the prospective part of the study is ongoing. FINDINGS: We enrolled 536 patients with a median follow-up of 20 days (IQR 10-34) at data cutoff, 85 (16%) of whom were managed as outpatients. 440 (98%) of 451 hospitalised patients completed their hospital course (were either discharged alive or died). 198 (37%) of 536 patients died. When compared with the general Italian population with COVID-19, the standardised mortality ratio was 2·04 (95% CI 1·77-2·34) in our whole study cohort and 3·72 (2·86-4·64) in individuals younger than 70 years. When compared with the non-COVID-19 cohort with haematological malignancies, the standardised mortality ratio was 41·3 (38·1-44·9). Older age (hazard ratio 1·03, 95% CI 1·01-1·05); progressive disease status (2·10, 1·41-3·12); diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (3·49, 1·56-7·81), indolent non-Hodgin lymphoma (2·19, 1·07-4·48), aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2·56, 1·34-4·89), or plasma cell neoplasms (2·48, 1·31-4·69), and severe or critical COVID-19 (4·08, 2·73-6·09) were associated with worse overall survival. INTERPRETATION: This study adds to the evidence that patients with haematological malignancies have worse outcomes than both the general population with COVID-19 and patients with haematological malignancies without COVID-19. The high mortality among patients with haematological malignancies hospitalised with COVID-19 highlights the need for aggressive infection prevention strategies, at least until effective vaccination or treatment strategies are available.

280759,Analysis of Facilitators and Barriers to the Delivery of Routine Care during the COVID-19 Global Pandemic: A Systematic Review,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence rates for dental diseases will continue unabated. However, the intent to prevent the spread of this lethal respiratory disease will likely lead to reduced treatment access due to restrictions on population movements. These changes have the potential to increase dental-related emergency department visits and subsequently contribute to greater viral transmission. Moreover, dentists experience unique challenges with preventing transmission due to frequent aerosol-producing procedures. This paper presents reviews and protocols implemented by directors and residents at the Dental College of Georgia to manage a dental emergency clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. The methods presented include committee-based prioritization of dental patients, a multilayered screening process, team rotations with social and temporal spacing, and modified treatment room protocols. These efforts aid in the reduction of viral transmission, conservation of personal protective equipment, and expand provider availability. These protocols transcend a university and hospital-based models and are applicable to private and corporate models.","Long, Robert Hollinshead; Ward, Tyrous David; Pruett, Michael Edward; Coleman, John Finklea; Plaisance, Marc Charles",Spec Care Dentist,,333

Individuals are either of the severe type or of the asymptomatic type. Only severe types have symptoms when they are infected, and the asymptomatic types can be contagious without knowing it. In the absence of any symptoms, individuals do not know their type and continuously tradeoff the costs and benefits of self-isolation on the basis of their belief of being the severe type. We show that all equilibria of the game involve social interaction, and we characterize the unique equilibrium in which individuals partially self-isolate at each date.

Methods A total of 55 patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 by RT-PCT or CT admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji COVID-19 Specialized Hospital from 2020-02-15 to 2020-02-25 were retrospectively analyzed. Case data were collected on the first-day history, and the chest CT, blood routine and C-response protein measurements. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and CT imaging features of the patients were analyzed. Results The first symptoms included fever in 33 cases (60.0%), cough in 30(54.6%) expectoration in 7(12.7%), dyspnea in 9(16.4%), chest distress in 15(27.3%), headache in 4(7.3%), fatigue in 33(60.0%), muscle soreness in 10(18.2%) and diarrhea in 7(12.7%). Most of the patients had normal white blood cell, lymphocyte and C-reactive protein levels. The imaging manifestations of CT lesions can be roughly divided into three categories: stripe shadow and consolidation as main clinical manifestations (26 cases, 47.3%), stripe shadow and consolidation mixed with ground glass opacity (10 cases, 18.2%) and patchy ground glass opacity (19 cases, 34.5%). Patients with more than two lobes involved were older, while other clinical and laboratory indexes were not closely related to imaging findings. Conclusions Most of the COVID-19 patients with delayed diagnosis and treatment may improve their clinical symptoms at the time of hospitalization with normal white blood cell, lymphocyte and C-reactive protein levels. Stripe shadow, consolidation, and patchy ground glass opacity are the major CT imaging findings. The patients with extensive lesions are older than these with localized CT imaging findings.","Jia, Ye; Yun-Hua, Yu; You-Guang, Lu; Chuan-Shen, Jiang; Xian-Liang, Lin; Wen-Feng, Lin; Guo-Qing, Yu; Dong-Liang, Li",Med.

There are limited reports describing the clinical features of COVID-19 in an IBD population, and the impact of immunosuppression on the severity of the infection remains unclear. Case Report: A 33-year-old female patient with a long history of ulcerative colitis, poorly controlled, was admitted with COVID-19 a few days after being discharged from the hospital for treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis. High-risk factors for COVID-19 complications, i.e., high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisone) and severe active disease, were present at admission. Despite the development of extensive pulmonary involvement, the patient had a favorable outcome. Discussion: Management of IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging. Measures to minimize the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including strict social distancing and self-isolation, in the IBD population have been recommended, especially for high-risk patients. Although steroid tapering and persistence of biologics are advised by professional groups, the best treatment strategy for IBD patients presenting a flare during the outbreak has yet to be defined.","Garcia, Karoline Soares; Moutinho, Bruna Damásio; De Azevedo, Matheus Freitas Cardoso; Queiroz, Natalia Sousa Freitas; Milani, Luciane Reis; Sanches, Lucas Navarro; Barros, Luisa Leite; Oba, Jane; Carlos, Alexandre De Sousa; Damião, Aderson Omar Mourão Cintra; Sipahi, Aytan Miranda",Inflamm.

283413,The Impact of COVID-19 on CGM Use in the Hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains ongoing around the world, including in areas where dengue is endemic. Dengue and COVID-19, to some extent, have similar clinical and laboratory features, which can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment and patient's isolation. The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) is easy and convenient for fast diagnosis, however there may be issues with cross-reactivity with antibodies for other pathogens. METHODS: We assessed the possibility of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue antibodies by: (1) testing five brands of COVID-19 IgG / IgM RDTs on 60 RT-PCR-confirmed dengue samples; (2) testing 95 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples on dengue RDT; and (3) testing samples positive for COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM on dengue RDT. RESULTS: We observed a high specificity across all five brands of COVID-19 RDTs, ranging from 98.3 to 100%. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 samples, one patient tested positive for dengue IgM only, another tested positive for dengue IgG only. One patient tested positive for dengue IgG, IgM, and NS1, suggesting a co-infection. In COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM samples, 6.3% of COVID-19 IgG-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG, while 21.1% of COVID-19 IgM-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG. CONCLUSION: Despite the high specificity of the COVID-19 RDT, we observed cross-reactions and false-positive results between dengue and COVID-19. Dengue and COVID-19 co-infection was also found. Health practitioners in dengue endemic areas should be careful when using antibody RDT for the diagnosis of dengue during the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid misdiagnosis.","Santoso, Marsha S; Masyeni, Sri; Haryanto, Sotianingsih; Yohan, Benediktus; Hibberd, Martin L; Sasmono, R Tedjo",Virol J,,333

We aimed to assess psychological distress in the general population of Tunisia during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the contribution of religious coping (RC) in the reports of anxiety and depression at the time of the survey. We carried out and online cross-sectional study using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 603 responses were recorded. The ""Depression Anxiety Stress Scales,"" the ""Brief religious coping scale"" and the ""Arabic religiosity scale"" were used. We found that 28.3%, 24.4% and 19.4% of the participants reported severe or extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. The mean score for positive RC was 22.8 ± 5.3, while that for negative RC was 14 ± 5.8. After controlling for confounders, multivariate analysis showed that negative RC significantly and positively contributed to depression and anxiety scores in our respondents, indicating that greater use of negative RC was associated with higher levels of psychological distress. No significant relationship was found between overall religiosity or positive religious coping and either depression or anxiety symptoms. Religious beliefs may have an impact on how people cope with emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Religion should be considered by professionals as an important variable to consider in therapy for individuals who engage in RC or perceive religious needs.","Fekih-Romdhane, Feten; Cheour, Majda",J Relig Health,,333

Methods: We collected epidemic data (cumulative daily confirmed cases in each country, cumulative confirmed imported cases), demographic data (population density, population) and information on potential source groups of tourists (the daily estimated number of overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese students, overseas workers, foreign students coming to China and flight passengers) and the global health security index (GHS) to assess and predict risk of imported cases for recent (February 1st to April 25th) and future (after April 26th). Results: Strong positive correlation was found among variables including the number of imported cases, cumulative confirmed cases, attack rate, number of overseas Chinese, number of overseas Chinese students, number of foreign students coming to China, number of flight passengers and GHS. In the recent risk analysis, imported cases of Russian were the highest, followed by United Kingdom, United States, France and Spain. In the future risk prediction, 44 countries including United States and Singapore are evaluated as potential high-risk countries in the future through the attack rate index of each country and the estimated average number of daily passengers. Conclusion: The risk assessment of COVID-19 imported cases can be used to identify high-risk areas in recent and future, and might be helpful to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic and ultimately overcome the epidemic.","Shen, S P; Wei, Y Y; Zhao, Y; Jiang, Y; Guan, J X; Chen, F",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,333

This article describes the unequal impact of Covid-19 amidst high inequality and identifies priorities for a human rights centred recovery. It does so by drawing lessons from the recovery efforts of the Great Recession of 2008, which placed Wall Street’s well-being above people’s rights and failed to consider structural inequalities. A post-recovery agenda in line with human rights means investing in people, social infrastructure and social protection. It means empowering workers, ensuring decent jobs, and a strong commitment to addressing structural inequities based on ecological and economic justice principles.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between PEHC and suspected COVID-19 symptoms (S-COVID-19-S), and to investigate the modification effect of HL and PB. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 8291 participants visiting outpatient departments at 18 hospitals and health centers across Vietnam from 14 February to 31 May 2020. Data were collected regarding participant's characteristics, HL, PB, PEHC, and S-COVID-19-S. Regression models were used for analyzing the associations. Results showed that people with PEHC had a 3.38 times higher likelihood of having S-COVID-19-S (odds ratio, OR, 3.38; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 3.01, 3.79; p < 0.001).

288078,"Response to: ""Risks of hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 prophylaxis""",2020,"The development of therapeutic approaches based on direct cardiac reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced-cardiomyocytes (iCM) has emerged as an attractive strategy to repair the injured myocardium. The identification of the mechanisms driving lineage conversion represents a crucial step toward the development of new and more efficient regenerative strategies. To this aim, here we show that pre-treatment with the Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209 is sufficient to increase the efficiency of Chemical-induced Direct Cardiac Reprogramming both in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult cardiac fibroblasts. PTC-209 induces an overall increase of spontaneously beating iCM at end-stage of reprogramming, expressing high levels of late cardiac markers Troponin T and myosin muscle light chain-2v. The inhibition of Bmi1 expression occurring upon PTC-209 pre-treatment was maintained throughout the reprogramming protocol, contributing to a significant gene expression de-regulation. RNA profiling revealed that, upon Bmi1 inhibition a significant down-regulation of genes associated with immune and inflammatory signalling pathways occurred, with repression of different genes involved in interleukin, cytokine and chemokine pathways. Accordingly, we observed the down-regulation of both JAK/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK1-2 pathway activation, highlighting the crucial role of these pathways as a barrier for cardiac reprogramming. These findings have significant implications for the development of new cardiac regenerative therapies.","Testa, Gianluca; Russo, Michele; Di Benedetto, Giorgia; Barbato, Matteo; Parisi, Silvia; Pirozzi, Flora; Tocchetti, Carlo Gabriele; Abete, Pasquale; Bonaduce, Domenico; Russo, Tommaso; Passaro, Fabiana",Sci Rep,,333
288621,Put ‘nursing’ back into aged care: Nursing care is essential to aged care homes beyond the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We examine corporate philanthropic decisions in response to the local spread of COVID-19. From a strategic perspective, firms may proactively undertake philanthropic efforts to limit the spread of the pandemic and avoid a degraded business environment. From the perspective of non-trivial costs, increased economic uncertainty can raise concerns about business survival and lead to conservative philanthropic strategies. Following the proverb ""prosperity makes friends, adversity tries them,"" at the provincial level, our results support the second perspective. Specifically, when the spread of the pandemic worsens in a province, local firms are less likely to make COVID-19-related donations in terms of likelihood and amount. Investors also react negatively, not only to the local spread of COVID-19 but also to COVID-19-related philanthropic donations. At the organizational level, our evidence indicates that there is at least some level of cost-benefit analysis underlying corporate philanthropic decisions. Specifically, corporate philanthropic donations, especially those made to the local business environment, are significantly affected by organizational-level factors, such as pre-existing resource availability and motives to acquire political and reputational resources. Overall, our multilevel study presents a comprehensive picture of corporate philanthropic decisions amid the COVID-19 crisis.","Chen, Hanwen; Liu, Siyi; Liu, Xin; Yang, Daoguang",J Bus Ethics,,333
290455,Epilepsy and COVID-19: Updated evidence and narrative review,2021,"The coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped RNA viruses that commonly cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses in the infected host. Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen of chickens that can affect the kidneys and reproductive systems resulting in bird mortality and decreased reproductivity. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are activated in response to viral infections and represent a class of cellular restriction factors that restrict the replication of many viral pathogens. Here, we characterize the relative mRNA expression of the chicken IFITM genes in response to IBV infection, in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro using the pathogenic M41-CK strain, the nephropathogenic QX strain and the nonpathogenic Beaudette strain. In vivo we demonstrate a significant upregulation of chIFITM1, 2, 3 and 5 in M41-CK- and QX-infected trachea two days post-infection. In vitro infection with Beaudette, M41-CK and QX results in a significant upregulation of chIFITM1, 2 and 3 at 24 h post-infection. We confirmed a differential innate response following infection with distinct IBV strains and believe that our data provide new insights into the possible role of chIFITMs in early IBV infection.","Steyn, Angela; Keep, Sarah; Bickerton, Erica; Fife, Mark",,,333

These areas are now recognized as potent hotspots regarding the pandemic, which one considers with special regard. Herein, we present currently available data of fatal COVID-19 cases throughout Hungary, along with the analysis of the co-morbidity network. We also report on viral genomic data originating from a nursing home resident. The genomic data was used for viral haplotype network analysis. We emphasize the urgent need for public health authorities to focus on nursing homes and residential service units worldwide, especially in the care of the elderly and infirmed. Our results further emphasize the recent statement released by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the vulnerability among seniors and especially the high risk of COVID-19 emergence throughout nursing and social homes.","Kemenesi, Gábor; Kornya, László; Tóth, Gábor Endre; Kurucz, Kornélia; Zeghbib, Safia; Somogyi, Balázs A; Zöldi, Viktor; Urbán, Péter; Herczeg, Róbert; Jakab, Ferenc",Geroscience,,333

296664,The outcomes and acceptance of pressurized metered-dose inhaler bronchodilators with venturi mask modified spacer in the outpatient emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The new coronavirus 2019, also known as COVID19, is a very serious epidemic that has killed thousands or even millions of people since December 2019. It was defined as a pandemic by the world health organization in March 2020. It is stated that this virus is usually transmitted by droplets caused by sneezing or coughing, or by touching infected surfaces. The presence of the virus is detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests with the help of a swab taken from the nose or throat. In addition, X-ray and CT imaging methods are also used to support this method. Since it is known that the accuracy sensitivity in rRT-PCR test is low, auxiliary diagnostic methods have a very important place. Computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems are developed especially with the help of X-ray and CT images. Studies on the detection of COVID19 in the literature are increasing day by day. In this study, the effect of different batch size (BH=3, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50) parameter values on their performance in detecting COVID19 and other classes was investigated using data belonging to 4 different (Viral Pneumonia, COVID19, Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia) classes. The study was carried out using a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network. According to the obtained results, they performed closely on the training and test data. However, it was observed that the steady state in the test data was delayed as the batch size value increased. The highest COVID19 detection was 95.17% for BH = 3, while the overall accuracy value was 97.97% with BH = 20. According to the findings, it can be said that the batch size value does not affect the overall performance significantly, but the increase in the batch size value delays obtaining stable results.","Narin, Ali; Pamuk, Ziynet",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05534v1.pdf,333

Despite its simplicity, the model actually incorporates variants of directed percolation, and directed polymers in random media, within a mean-field perspective. Probability distributions of the population can be computed self-consistently; and the extinction transition is shown to exhibit novel critical behavior with exponents dependent on the ratio of the strengths of migration and noise amplitudes. The results are compared and contrasted with the more conventional choice of demographic noise due to stochastic changes in reproduction.","Ottino-Loffler, Bertrand; Kardar, Mehran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11749v1.pdf,333

BACKGROUND: Presenteeism (going to work ill) is a phenomenon studied from different perspectives, and it has become especially important during the current COVID-19 outbreak; its connection to high healthcare costs, patient safety breaches and negative nurse well-being has been proved. INTRODUCTION: The nursing profession is particularly associated with caring for the culture of teamwork, loyalty to colleagues and professional identity. This condition enhances the 'super nurse phenomenon', even though nurses do not feel physically and psychologically able to work. METHODS: A multicentre, cross-sectional study was conducted in three different country contexts: Oviedo (Spain), Porto (Portugal) and São Paulo (Brazil). Nurses performing functions in hospitals and primary health care were enrolled. Informed consent and data collection questionnaires were hand delivered. The Stanford Presenteeism Scale-6 was applied. RESULTS: A total of 659 nurses participated. Portuguese nurses showed greater prevalence of presenteeism, followed by Brazilian and Spanish nurses. Younger nurses with less professional experience presented lower levels of presenteeism but greater psychological commitment. Male participants showed lower capacity to complete work when ill than female participants. CONCLUSIONS: Age and length of professional experience proved to be significant predictors of total presenteeism, although only professional experience revealed statistical significance in the adjusted model. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: The knowledge of this phenomenon among nurses highlights the need for the development of strategies in the curriculum of nursing students and organizations. Resilience and ergonomic training should be applied in the training programmes of the students and reinforced by the health centre managers. It is essential that healthcare systems design worksite wellness programmes that pursue greater physical and mental well-being for healthcare professionals.","Mosteiro-Díaz, Maria-Pilar; Baldonedo-Mosteiro, María; Borges, Elisabete; Baptista, Patricia; Queirós, Cristina; Sánchez-Zaballos, Marta; Felli, Vanda; Abreu, Margarida; Silva, Fábio; Franco-Correia, Sara",Int. nurs. rev,,333

Their professional identity may affect whether they can actively participate and be competent in care tasks during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the level of and changes in professional identity of Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses as the COVID-19 pandemic builds. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey composed of the Professional Identity Scale for Nurses plus 2 open-ended questions was administered to Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses through an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Emergency and intensive care unit nurses had a medium level of professional identity. Participants' total and item mean scores in 5 professional identity dimensions were higher than the professional identity norm established by Liu (P < .001). The greatest mean item score difference was in the dimension of professional identity evaluation (3.57 vs 2.88, P < .001). When asked about their feelings witnessing the COVID-19 situation and their feelings about participating in frontline work, 68.9% and 83.9%, respectively, reported positive changes in their professional identity. CONCLUSIONS: The professional identity of emergency and intensive care unit nurses greatly improved during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

305840,COVID-19 and Tobacco: More Questions Than Answers,2020,"Background: The corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) imposed new public health constraints that deterred people from coming to the hospital. The outcome of patients who developed appendicitis during mandated COVID-19 quarantine has yet to be examined. The main objective was to establish whether there was an increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during COVID-19 quarantine. Secondary objectives included observing the type of procedure performed, length of stay, and associated complications. Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis was designed to look at the rates of appendicitis and perforated appendicitis observed during mandatory ""safer at home order"" from March to May 2020. The same time period a year earlier was used for comparative analysis. The study utilized data gathered from a single health care system, which consisted of a large regional referral center with three emergency rooms (ERs). Patients were included in the study if they presented to any ER in our health care system with a chief complaint of acute appendicitis. Perforated appendicitis was determined either radiographically or intraoperatively. Interventions included surgery, percutaneous drainage, or medical management. Results: There were 107 patients who were included. During quarantine, a total of 48 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 16 perforations, compared with the previous year where 59 patients presented with acute appendicitis, with 10 perforations (33% versus 17% P = .04). Most patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (91%, n = 98), six patients (6%) were managed with intravenous antibiotics and 3 patients (3%) with percutaneous drainage. Patients who perforated had a longer duration of symptoms (2 versus 1, P = .03), white blood cell count (13,190 versus 15,960 cells/mm3, P = .09), and longer operative time (72 versus 89 minutes, P = .01). Patients who perforated had an increased length of stay and rate of complication. Conclusion: There was an overall increased rate of perforated appendicitis seen during quarantine compared with the previous year. Patients with perforated appendicitis had an increased length of stay, longer operative time, and increased rate of complications.

The focus of early stage clinical trials (including the first human trial) is the selection of subjects, study design, dose selection, administration method, dose escalation, monitoring, observation and reporting procedures for adverse events/reactions (tolerability evaluation), and criteria for subjects to continue and discontinue administration. Therefore, quantitative pharmacology knowledge is required to analyze the relationship between in vivo drug exposure, efficacy and adverse reactions, and the inclusion of exploratory indicators such as HBV RNA, hepatitis B virus core-related antigen (HBcrAg), etc., to analyze the mechanism and target of innovative drugs and the efficacy of cccDNA in anti-hepatocytes. On the other hand, Phase II-III clinical trials prioritize the optimal dose, efficacy and safety indicators to verify the efficacy and safety of new drugs in a wider range of subjects. This paper refers to the relevant domestic and foreign literature, combined with the author's practical experience in early clinical research, and then briefly introduces the clinical issues that should be paid attention to in the design of clinical trials of CHB innovative drugs.","Niu, J Q; Zhang, H; You, H; Ding, Y H; Dong, R H; Hou, J L; Jia, J D",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,,333
308371,Recommendations for head and neck surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"For mitigation strategies of an influenza outbreak, it can be helpful to understand the characteristics of regional and age-group-specific spread. In South Korea, however, there has been no official statistic related to it. In this study, we extract the time series of influenza incidence from National Health Insurance Service claims database, which consists of all medical and prescription drug-claim records for all South Korean population. The extracted time series contains the number of new patients by region (250 city-county-districts) and age-group (0-4, 5-19, 20-64, 65+) within a week. The number of cases of influenza (2009-2017) is 12,282,356. For computing an onset of influenza outbreak by region and age-group, we propose a novel method for early outbreak detection, in which the onset of outbreak is detected as a sudden change in the time derivative of incidence. The advantage of it over the cumulative sum and the exponentially weighted moving average control charts, which have been widely used for the early outbreak detection of infectious diseases, is that information on the previous non-epidemic periods are not necessary. Then, we show that the metro area and 5-19 age-group are earlier than the rural area and other age-groups for the start of the influenza outbreak. Also, the metro area and 5-19 age-group peak earlier than the rural area and other age-groups. These results would be helpful to design a surveillance system for timely early warning of an influenza outbreak in South Korea.","Son, Woo-Sik; Park, Ji-Eun; Kwon, Okyu",EPJ Data Sci,,333

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a first-order MI transition at 340 K. For more than half a century, it has been debated whether electron correlation or the structural instability due to dimerised V ions is the more essential driving force behind this MI transition. Here, we show that an ultrahigh magnetic field of 500 T renders the insulator phase of tungsten (W)-doped VO2 metallic. The spin Zeeman effect on the d electrons of the V ions dissociates the dimers in the insulating phase, resulting in the delocalisation of electrons. As the Mott-Hubbard gap essentially does not depend on the spin degree of freedom, the structural instability is likely to be the more essential driving force behind the MI transition.","Matsuda, Yasuhiro H; Nakamura, Daisuke; Ikeda, Akihiko; Takeyama, Shojiro; Suga, Yuki; Nakahara, Hayato; Muraoka, Yuji",Nat Commun,,333
309094,Neuro-rehabilitation service during COVID-19 pandemic: Best practices from UK,2020,"Problem: A worldwide challenge is to provide medical resources required for COVID-19 detection. They must be effective tools for fast detection and diagnose of the virus using a large number of tests;besides, they should be low-cost developments. While a chest x-ray scan is a powerful candidate tool, if several tests are carried out, the images produced by the devices must be interpreted accurately and rapidly. COVID-19 induces longitudinal pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidates pulmonary opacity, in some cases with rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution, which is very difficult to predict in an early stage. Aim In this paper, we aim to develop a robust model to extract high-level features of COVID-19 from chest x-ray (CXR) images to help in rapid diagnosis. In specific, this paper proposes an optimization model for COVID-19 diagnosis based on adaptive Fuzzy C-means (AFCM) and improved Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) based on Lévy distribution, namely AFCM-LSMA. Methods The SMA optimizer is proposed to adapt weights in oscillation mode and to mimic the process of generating positive and negative feedback from the propagation wave to shape the optimum path for food connectivity. Lévy motion is used as a permutation to perform a local search and to adapt SMA optimizer (LSMA) by generating several solutions that are apart from current candidates. Furthermore, it permits the optimizer to escape from local minima, examine large search areas and reach optimal solutions in fewer iterations with high convergence speed. The FCM algorithm is used to segment pulmonary regions from CXR images and is adapted to reduce time and amount of computations using histogram of the image intensities during the clustering process. Results The performance of the proposed AFCM-LSMA has been validated on CXR images and compared with different conventional machine learning and deep learning techniques, meta-heuristics methods, and different chaotic maps. The accuracies achieved by the proposed model are around (ACC=0.96, RMSE=0.23, Prec.=0.98, F1_score=0.98, MCC=0.79, and Kappa=0.79). Conclusion The experimental findings indicate that the proposed new method outperforms all other methods, which will be beneficial to the clinical practitioner for the early identification of infected COVID-19 patients.","Anter, Ahmed M.; Oliva, Diego Thakare Anuradha Zhang Zhiguo",Advanced Engineering Informatics,,333

We employ an approach that values benefits and costs in terms of additions or subtractions to total production. Relative to a baseline in which only the infected and at-risk populations mitigate the spread of coronavirus, we estimate that total benefits of suppression policies to economic output are between $632.5 billion and $765.0 billion from early March 2020 to August 1, 2020. Relative to private mitigation, output lost due to suppression policies is estimated to be between $214.2 billion and $331.5 billion. The cost estimate is based on the duration of nonessential business closures and stay-at-home orders, which were enforced between 42 and 65 days. Our results indicate that the net benefits of suppression policies to slow the spread of COVID-19 are positive and may be substantial. We discuss uncertainty surrounding several parameters and employ alternative methods for valuing mortality benefits, which also suggest that suppression measures had positive net benefits.","Broughel, James; Kotrous, Michael",PLoS One,,333

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented challenges to workplace safety and health for workers and managers in essential businesses, including healthcare workers, grocery stores, delivery services, warehouses, and distribution centers. Essential workers need protection, accurate information, and a supportive work environment with an unwavering focus on effective infection control. METHOD: The investigators reviewed emerging workplace recommendations for reducing workers' exposures to the novel coronavirus and the challenges to workers in protecting their health. Using a theoretical framework and guidelines for integrating safety and health management systems into an organization for TWH, the investigators adapted the framework's key characteristics to meet the specific worker safety and health issues for effective infection control, providing supports for increasing psychological demands while ensuring a safe work environment. RESULTS: The recommended approach includes six key characteristics: focusing on working conditions for infection control and supportive environments for increased psychological demands; utilizing participatory approaches involving workers in identifying daily challenges and unique solutions; employing comprehensive and collaborative efforts to increase system efficiencies; committing as leaders to supporting workers through action and communications; adhering to ethical and legal standards; and using data to guide actions and evaluate progress. CONCLUSION: Applying an integrative TWH approach for worker safety, health, and well-being provides a framework to help managers systematically organize and protect themselves, essential workers, and the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. APPLICATION: By using the systems approach provided by the six implementation characteristics, employers of essential workers can organize their own efforts to improve system performance and worker well-being during these unprecedented times.","Dennerlein, Jack T; Burke, Lisa; Sabbath, Erika L; Williams, Jessica A R; Peters, Susan E; Wallace, Lorraine; Karapanos, Melissa; Sorensen, Glorian",Hum Factors,,333
310659,Personal prophylaxis against COVID-19: A compilation of evidence based recommendations,2020,"BACKGROUND: Candida auris was first described in Japan in 2009 and has since been detected in over 40 countries. The yeast is concerning for multiple reasons, primarily: (1) challenges with accurate identification; (2) reported multidrug resistance; (3) published mortality rates of 30%-60%; and (4) persistence in the environment associated with human transmission. We report the emergence of a healthcare-associated cluster in the Greater Vancouver area in 2018 and describe the measures implemented to contain its transmission. METHODS: Cases were identified through passive and ring surveillance of affected wards. Positive isolates were sent to provincial and national reference laboratories for confirmation and genomic characterization. Extensive infection control measures were implemented immediately after the initial case was identified. RESULTS: Four cases were identified during the outbreak. In a 4-month period, over 700 swabs were collected in order to screen 180 contacts. Whole genome sequencing concluded that all isolates clustered together and belonged to the South Asian clade. No isolates harbored FKS gene mutations associated with resistance to echinocandins. Infection control measures, including surveillance, education, cleaning and/or disinfection, patient cohorting, isolation, and hand hygiene, effectively contained the outbreak; it was declared over within 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: The spread of C auris in healthcare facilities has not spared Canadian institutions. Our experience demonstrates that strict infection control measures combined with microbiological screening can effectively halt transmission in healthcare centers. The necessity of active prospective screening remains unclear.","Eckbo, Eric J; Wong, Titus; Bharat, Amrita; Cameron-Lane, Mary; Hoang, Linda; Dawar, Meena; Charles, Marthe",Am J Infect Control,,333

312252,28 Validation of prioritization scoring tools for triage of elective gynecologic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Social inclusion is an important indicator of recovery in individuals with severe mental illness. The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) is a new measure of social inclusion for mental health service users which assesses five domains (consumption, production, access to services, social integration and civil engagement). It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion. AIMS: (1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness. METHOD: Mental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations. RESULTS: About 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p = .008), lack of higher education (p < .001), more previous admissions (p = .005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p = .006) and anticipated stigma (p = .035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p < .001) and less loneliness (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed. Increasing people's social inclusion benefits service users in terms of improved mental health, better quality of life and reduced loneliness.","Mezey, Gillian; White, Sarah; Harrison, Isobel; Bousfield, Jennifer; Killaspy, Helen; Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor; Payne, Sarah",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,333

Blood alcohol concentration, urine toxicology results, demographics, and injury characteristics were collected. Patients were grouped based on injury date - before SAH (PRE-SAH), immediately after SAH (POST-SAH), and a historical comparison (3/19/2019-6/30/2019) (CONTROL) - and compared in separate analyses. Groups were compared using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables.Results: 20,448 trauma patients (13,634 male, 6,814 female) were identified across three time-periods.

So who should be prioritized for vaccination when in the first instance, there will be insufficient supply to meet demand? There is no doubt that health-care workers in all settings should be vaccinated first, but who comes next will be a complex decision based on local epidemiology, societal values, and the ability of the vaccines to prevent both severe disease and to reduce transmission thereby eliciting herd protection. The decision on who to vaccinate should be equitable, highly contextualized, and based on the property of each vaccine. In some settings, the elderly may be prioritized, in others, it may be the population most likely to get infected and responsible for community spread. To support decision-making on who to be prioritized for vaccination requires urgent additional research on the epidemiology of COVID-19; preexisting immunity and who is responsible for transmission in a variety of settings; the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in children and pregnant women; and determining whether COVID-19 vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.","Russell, Fiona M; Greenwood, Brian",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,333

Creating models to describe and quantify alternative mitigation strategies becomes increasingly urgent. In this study, we propose an agent-based model of disease transmission in a society divided into closely connected families, workplaces, and social groups. This allows us to discuss mitigation strategies, including targeted quarantine measures. We find that workplace and more diffuse social contacts are roughly equally important to disease spread, and that an effective lockdown must target both. We examine the cost-benefit of replacing a lockdown with tracing and quarantining contacts of the infected. Quarantine can contribute substantially to mitigation, even if it has short duration and is done within households. When reopening society, testing and quarantining is a strategy that is much cheaper in terms of lost workdays than a long lockdown. A targeted quarantine strategy is quite efficient with only 5 days of quarantine, and its effect increases when testing is more widespread.","Eilersen, Andreas; Sneppen, Kim",Sci Rep,,333

Many patients have delayed care and continue to express concerns about potential nosocomial spread of coronavirus. Objective: To quantify risk of development of COVID19 due to in-hospital transmission related to an electrophysiology procedure, in the setting of preventive measures instituted in our laboratory areas. Methods: We contacted patients by telephone who underwent emergent procedures in the electrophysiology lab during the COVID19 surge at our hospital (3/16/2020 to 5/15/2020, reaching daily census 450 COVID19 patients,) > two weeks after the procedure, to assess for symptoms of and/or testing for COVID-19, and assessed outcomes from medical record review. Results: Of the 124 patients undergoing EP procedures in this period, none had developed documented or suspected coronavirus infection. 7 patients described symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, or fever; 3 were tested for coronavirus and found to be negative. Of the remaining 4, 2 had a more plausible alternative explanation for the symptoms, and 2 had transient symptoms not meeting published criteria for probable COVID19 infection. Conclusion: Despite a high hospital census of COVID-19 patients during the period of hospital stay for an electrophysiology procedure, there were no likely COVID-19 infections occurring in follow up of at least two weeks. With proper use of preventive measures as recommended by published guidelines, the risk of nosocomial spread of COVID-19 to patients in the electrophysiology lab is low.","Workman, Virginia; Freeman, James V; Obasare, Edinrin R; Jain, Shashank; Ganeshan, Raj; Burr, Alicia; Blitzer, Mark; Akar, Joseph; Lampert, Rachel",,,333
316799,COVID-19 and immunomodulator/immunosuppressant use in dermatology,2020,"PURPOSE: This study was to investigate the work experience of newly recruited male nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: With a phenomenological approach, this qualitative study was adopted semi-structured interviews by phone or video calls. A total of 9 male nurses newly recruited for the COVID-19 wards in Chinese hospitals were interviewed for this study. And Colaizzi's method was applied for evaluation in the data analysis. RESULTS: Based on our findings, three themes were extracted. Firstly, the newly recruited male nurses showed negative emotions at the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, which was caused by changesin working conditions and content, but also prompted the nurses to change the way of coping with the crisis. Secondly, they gradually mastered the working skills and psychological training tocope with COVID-19, and developed a positive attitude towards life and a high sense of professional responsibility. Finally, we learned about their needs to respond to public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a disaster for all of humanity. The newly recruited male nurses are an important force in emergency rescue. Although they suffered from short-term negative emotions, they quickly adapted to the crisis. In order to better prepare for future emergencies, the disaster response capacity of newly recruited male nurses needs to be further improved. In addition, newly recruited male nurses have a strong demand for timely and personalized career development guidance.","Zhou, Huiyue; Wang, Xin; Du, Ruofei; Cheng, Xiang; Zheng, Kexin; Dong, Shiqi; Henri, Justin; Chen, Changying; Wang, Tao",Asian nurs. res.

319757,The Impact of the First 2020 COVID-19 Lockdown on the Metabolic Control of Patients with Phenylketonuria,2021,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although SARS-CoV-2 is visualized on electron microscopy, there is an increasing demand for widely applicable techniques to visualize viral components within tissue specimens. Viral protein and RNA can be detected on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. Herein, we evaluate the staining performance of ISH for SARS-CoV-2 and an IHC directed at the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and compare these results to a gold standard, tissue quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We evaluated FFPE sections from 8 COVID-19 autopsies, including 19 pulmonary and 39 extrapulmonary samples including the heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, adipose tissue, and bone marrow. We performed RNA-ISH for SARS-CoV-2 on all cases with IHC for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR performed on selected cases. Lungs from 37 autopsies performed before the COVID-19 pandemic served as negative controls. The ISH and IHC slides were reviewed by 4 observers to record a consensus opinion. Selected ISH and IHC slides were also reviewed by 4 independent observers. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on both the IHC and ISH platforms. Within the postmortem lung, detected viral protein and RNA were often extracellular, predominantly within hyaline membranes in patients with diffuse alveolar damage. Among individual cases, there was regional variation in the amount of detectable virus in lung samples. Intracellular viral RNA and protein was localized to pneumocytes and immune cells. Viral RNA was detected on RNA-ISH in 13 of 19 (68%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19. Viral protein was detected on IHC in 8 of 9 (88%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19, although in 5 cases the stain was interpreted as equivocal. From the control cohort, FFPE blocks from all 37 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH, whereas 5 of 13 cases were positive on IHC. Collectively, when compared with qRT-PCR on individual tissue blocks, the sensitivity and specificity for ISH was 86.7% and 100%, respectively, while those for IHC were 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The interobserver variability for ISH ranged from moderate to almost perfect, whereas that for IHC ranged from slight to moderate. All extrapulmonary samples from COVID-19-positive cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on both RNA-ISH and nucleocapsid IHC. In the lung, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is predominantly extracellular and within hyaline membranes in some cases, while intracellular locations are more prominent in others. The intracellular virus is detected within pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and possibly immune cells. The ISH platform is more specific, easier to analyze and the interpretation is associated with the improved interobserver agreement. ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR failed to detect the virus in the heart, liver, and kidney.","Massoth, Lucas R; Desai, Niyati; Szabolcs, Annamaria; Harris, Cynthia K; Neyaz, Azfar; Crotty, Rory; Chebib, Ivan; Rivera, Miguel N; Sholl, Lynette M; Stone, James R; Ting, David T; Deshpande, Vikram",Am. j. surg. pathol,,333
319766,Italy and COVID-19: the changing patient flow in an orthopedic trauma center emergency department,2020,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a global public health challenge. The viral pathogen responsible, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to the host receptor ACE2 through its spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates membrane fusion and viral entry. Although the role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is clear, studies have shown that ACE2 expression is extremely low in various human tissues, especially in the respiratory tract. Thus, other host receptors and/or co-receptors that promote the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells of the respiratory system may exist. In this study, we found that the tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) specifically interacts with the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 S. Using both a SARS-CoV-2 virus pseudotype and authentic SARS-CoV-2, we found that overexpression of AXL in HEK293T cells promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry as efficiently as overexpression of ACE2, while knocking out AXL significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in H1299 pulmonary cells and in human primary lung epithelial cells. Soluble human recombinant AXL blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells expressing high levels of AXL. The AXL expression level is well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 S level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that AXL is a novel candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 which may play an important role in promoting viral infection of the human respiratory system and indicate that it is a potential target for future clinical intervention strategies.","Wang, Shuai; Qiu, Zongyang; Hou, Yingnan; Deng, Xiya; Xu, Wei; Zheng, Tingting; Wu, Peihan; Xie, Shaofang; Bian, Weixiang; Zhang, Chong; Sun, Zewei; Liu, Kunpeng; Shan, Chao; Lin, Aifu; Jiang, Shibo; Xie, Youhua; Zhou, Qiang; Lu, Lu; Huang, Jing; Li, Xu",Cell Res,,333

With the implementation of lockdown rules, road traffic and outdoor activities were expected to drop, thereby reducing the number of high-energy spinal injuries. Critical non-traumatic spinal conditions like spinal tumours, infections, or compressive pathologies, however, should continue to present as before. We assessed all acute spinal referrals to our tertiary spine unit comparing with the acute activity for a similar time frame in the previous year. The aim was to identify any variance in the acute spinal activity, explain reasons for the discrepancy and identify any learning points. Materials: All acute referrals to our tertiary spinal surgery unit made from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020 were evaluated. Similar data from the preceding year, i.e. 2019 was evaluated for comparison. Data were analysed for qualitative or quantitative changes in the referral pattern and their subsequent management outcomes. Results: Spinal referral numbers reduced by 46.05% during the time frame of February–April 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019 (p &lt; 0.017). Similarly, numbers of high-energy traumatic presentations reduced by 72% (p &lt; 0.002). Referrals for critical spinal conditions declined by two-thirds for spinal infections and more than a third for spinal tumours. Emergency surgical workload waned by 27%, especially more so during the six-week lockdown duration. Conclusion: Reduction in spinal activity, even for critical spinal conditions, during the pandemic is likely due to a combination of factors like patient behaviour, fear of contracting COVID-19 infection during hospital visit, self-isolation advice, availability of a senior decision maker on the frontlines, and changes in healthcare service provisions. The health crisis may provide an opportunity for optimisation of spinal healthcare services both at the referring hospital and at the tertiary centre.","Ahuja, Sashin; Shah, Pranav; Mohammed, Riaz",Br.

However, racial and ethnic digital divides, which are disparities among people who have internet access and post on social media, can bias inferences. This bias is particularly problematic in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because due to structural inequalities, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately vulnerable to contracting the virus and to the deleterious economic and social effects from mitigation efforts. Further, important demographic intersections with race and ethnicity, such as gender and age, are rarely investigated in work characterizing social media users; however, they reflect additional axes of inequality shaping differential exposure to COVID-19 and its effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize how the race and ethnicity of US adults are associated with their odds of posting COVID-19 content on social media and how gender and age modify these odds. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from March 19 to 24, 2020, using a national probability sample (N=10,510). Respondents were recruited from an online panel, where panelists without an internet-enabled device were given one to keep at no cost. The binary dependent variable was responses to an item asking whether respondents ""used social media to share or post information about the coronavirus."" We used survey-weighted logistic regressions to estimate the odds of responding in the affirmative based on the race and ethnicity of respondents (white, black, Latino, other race/ethnicity), adjusted for covariates measuring sociodemographic background and COVID-19 experiences. We examined how gender (female, male) and age (18 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 64 years, and 65 years and older) intersected with race and ethnicity by estimating interactions. RESULTS: Respondents who identified as black (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64; P=.03), Latino (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-2.04; P<.001), or other races/ethnicities (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72; P=.03) had higher odds than respondents who identified as white of reporting that they posted COVID-19 content on social media. Women had higher odds of posting than men regardless of race and ethnicity (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39-1.80; P<.001). Among men, respondents who identified as black, Latino, or members of other races/ethnicities were significantly more likely to post than respondents who identified as white. Older adults (65 years or older) had significantly lower odds (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94; P=.01) of posting compared to younger adults (18-29 years), particularly among those identifying as other races/ethnicities. Latino respondents were the most likely to report posting across all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are most likely to contribute to COVID-19 content on social media, particularly among groups traditionally less likely to use social media (older adults and men). The next step is to ensure that data collection procedures capture this diversity by encompassing a breadth of search criteria and social media platforms.","Campos-Castillo, Celeste; Laestadius, Linnea I",J Med Internet Res,,333
324652,"COVID-19 Workplace Outbreaks by Industry Sector and Their Associated Household Transmission, Ontario, Canada, January to June, 2020",2021,"Purpose: Research fatigue occurs when an individual or population of interest tires of engaging with research, consequently avoiding further participation. This paper considers research fatigue in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, to identify contributory factors and possible solutions for future post-disaster research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on examples from the literature and their own observations from the recruitment and data collection phases of qualitative and quantitative studies, to provide an overview of possible research fatigue in the current COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for future post-disaster research. Findings: People affected by disasters sometimes receive multiple requests for study participation by separate teams who may not necessarily be coordinating their work. Not keeping participants informed of the research process or outcomes can lead to disillusionment. Being overburdened with too many research requests and failing to see any subsequent changes following participation may cause individuals to experience research fatigue. Originality/value: Guidelines for researchers wishing to reduce the occurrence of research fatigue include ensuring greater transparency within research; sharing of results and using oversight or gatekeeper bodies to aid coordination. Failure to restrict the number of times that people are asked to participate in studies risks poor participation rates. This can subsequently affect the quality of information with which to inform policy-makers and protect the health of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health disasters/emergencies.","Patel, Sonny S.; Webster, Rebecca K.; Greenberg, Neil; Weston, Dale; Brooks, Samantha K.",Disaster Prev.

324867,Halitosis in COVID-19 patients,2020,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease in wild and domestic cat species. Although several drugs are expected to be useful as treatments for FIP, no drugs are available in clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of combined use of adalimumab (an anti-human-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, ADA) and itraconazole (ICZ), which are presently available to veterinarians. The neutralizing activity of ADA against fTNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity was measured in WEHI-164 cells. Ten specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats were inoculated intraperitoneally with type I FIPV KU-2. To the cats that developed FIP, ADA (10 mg/animal) was administered twice between day 0 and day 4 after the start of treatment. ICZ (50 mg/head, SID) was orally administered daily from day 0 after the start of treatment. ADA demonstrated dose-dependent neutralizing activity against rfTNF-alpha. In an animal experiment, 2 of 3 cats showed improvements in FIP clinical symptoms and blood chemistry test results, an increase in the peripheral blood lymphocyte count, and a decrease in the plasma alpha 1-AGP level were observed after the beginning of treatment. One of the cats failed to respond to treatment and was euthanized, although the viral gene level in ascites temporarily decreased after the start of treatment. ADA was found to have neutralizing activity against rfTNF-alpha. The combined use of ADA and ICZ showed a therapeutic effect for experimentally induced FIP. We consider these drugs to be a treatment option until effective anti-FIPV drugs become available.","Doki, Tomoyoshi; Toda, Masahiro; Hasegawa, Nobuhisa; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Takano, Tomomi",Arch Virol,,333

328271,COVID-19 and its implications for obstetrics and gynecology practice in Africa,2021,"Background Nurses are the primary clinicians who collect specimens for respiratory tract infection testing. The specimen collection procedure is time and resource-consuming, but more importantly, it places nurses at risk for potential infection. The practice of allowing patients to self-collect their diagnostic specimens may provide an alternative testing model for the current COVID-19 outbreaks. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and patient perception of self-collected specimens for respiratory tract infection diagnostics. Methods A concise clinical review of the recently published literature was conducted. Results A total of 11 articles were included the review synthesis. The concept of self-collected specimens has a high patient acceptance rate of 83-99%. Self-collected nasal-swab specimens demonstrated strong diagnostic fidelity for respiratory tract infections with a sensitivity between 80-100%, this is higher than the 76% sensitivity observed with self-collected throat specimens. In a comparative study evaluating a professionally collected to a self-collected specimen for COVID-19 testing, a high degree of agreement (k = 0.89) was observed between the two methods. Conclusion As we continue to explore for testing models to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, self-collected specimens is a practical alternative to nurse specimen collection.","Nguyen, Thang T.; Zeger, Wesley G.; Wadman, Michael C.; Barksdale, Aaron N.",Journal of Emergency Nursing,,333

A proposed solution would be a Multisectoral Approach (MSA). MSA refers to the deliberate collaboration among various stakeholder groups (e.g. government, civil society and private and religious sectors) and sectors (e.g. health, environment and economy) to achieve a policy outcome. By engaging multiple sectors, such as interfaith collaborations, governments can leverage knowledge, expertise, reach and resources, benefiting from their combined and varied strengths as they work toward the shared goal of building public trust on vaccines.","Corpuz, Jeff Clyde G",J Public Health (Oxf),,333
328696,"Moral courage, moral sensitivity and safe nursing care in nurses caring of patients with COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: While the association between relationship status and the development of depressive symptoms in the general population were reported previously, its relation to the severity and the course of major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as the treatment patterns and response rates needs to be elucidated. METHODS: The present international multicenter cross-sectional study performed by the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression (GSRD) investigated socio-demographic and clinical patterns of relationship status in a real-world sample of 1410 adult in- and outpatients with MDD as primary diagnosis. RESULTS: While 49.9% of all MDD patients were partnered, 25.4% were separated, and 24.8% were single. Single relationship status was linked to younger mean age, earlier mean age of onset, and current suicidal risk. Being separated was related to older mean age, unemployment, greater symptom severity, current suicidal risk, and add-on treatment strategies. Partnered relationship status was associated with less frequent current suicidal risk. LIMITATIONS: The retrospective assessment of treatment response that was exclusively based on psychopharmacotherapeutic strategies should be critically considered and weighed while interpreting the present results providing novel insights into the complex interaction of relationship status with the clinical phenotype of MDD. CONCLUSIONS: Although MDD patients living in relationships do not seem to be omitted from the evolution of MDD, they may be spared from chronicity and suicidality. Hence, being aware of the current relationship status might support clinicians in the diagnostic and therapeutic process towards optimized management of such challenging clinical phenomena and their negative consequences.","Bartova, Lucie; Dold, Markus; Fugger, Gernot; Kautzky, Alexander; Mitschek, Marleen Margret Mignon; Weidenauer, Ana; Handschuh, Patricia Anna; Frey, Richard; Mandelli, Laura; Zohar, Joseph; Mendlewicz, Julien; Souery, Daniel; Montgomery, Stuart; Fabbri, Chiara; Serretti, Alessandro; Kasper, Siegfried",J Affect Disord,,333

330522,Letter in Reply: Toward a COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy for Pemphigus Patients on Rituximab,2020,"BACKGROUND Music performance is a highly stressful activity, requiring skilled neuromuscular dexterity. A lack of reported strategies for musicians suffering performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) exists. Papers investigating the role that postural distortions or spinal structural anomalies that could play a role in setting the stage for PRMD do not exist. The purpose of this paper was to provide a description and discussion of the use of a specialized upper cervical manual correction at the cranio-cervical junction (CCJ) to treat a violist who had disabling pain in her wrists, arms, neck, and hip. Differential diagnoses are required regarding possible confounding elements within the cervical spine. CASE REPORT After 40 years of music performance, a violist experienced severe pain while attempting to play the simplest student musical pieces. Early retirement seemed imminent. To determine appropriate chiropractic approach, the patient's clinical assessment included active range of motion, chiropractic tests, palpation, and radiographic study. Postural distortions, hypertonic muscles, joint pain, arthritis, and ponticulus posticus (PP) were noted. Upper cervical spine orthogonal radiographic series were used to develop a correction strategy. These images identified excursion of the cervical spine away from the vertical axis and C0-C1-C2 misalignments. After performing low-velocity, low-force manual correction to the CCJ, the patient experienced immediate relief of wrist pain. Over a 9-month follow-up period, the patient reported gradual decrease of pain and increased stamina while performing. Upon completing chiropractic care, the violist's career was restored. CONCLUSIONS This case supports the hypothesis that evaluating and correcting spinal structures proximal to painful extremities may represent an efficient and long-lasting solution for PRMD.","Schalow, Philip R",Am J Case Rep,,333
330537,Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Quality Improvement Principles: A New York City Pediatric Primary Care Experience,2021,"Current debates identifying urban population density as a major catalyst for the spread of COVID-19, and the praise for de-densification and urban sprawl that they entail, may have dire environmental consequences. Juxtaposing competing theories about the urban antecedents of COVID-19, our key argument is that urban political attributes overshadow the effects of cities' spatial characteristics. This is true even when considering levels of compliance with movement restrictions and controlling for demographic and socio-economic conditions. Taking advantage of Israel as a living lab for studying COVID-19, we examine 271 localities during the first 3 months of the outbreak in Israel, a country where over 90% of the population is urban. Rather than density, we find social makeup and politics to have a critical effect. Cities with some types of political minority groups, but not others, exhibit higher infection rates. Compliance has a significant effect and density's influence on the spread of the disease is contingent on urban political attributes. We conclude with assessing how the relationship between the politics of cities and the spread of contagious diseases sheds new light on tensions between neo-Malthusian sentiments and concerns about urban sprawl and environmental degradation.","Barak, Nir; Sommer, Udi; Mualam, Nir",Sci Total Environ,,333

We evaluated knowledge, attitudes, and practices among the general population of Punjab, Pakistan in this cross-sectional study. METHODS: We used a 50-item questionnaire to collect information on participant demographics, knowledge, and attitudes about antibiotics use and to evaluate the practices of taking antibiotics without a doctor's prescription. RESULTS: Of the 2106 participants who completed surveys, 35.4% thought antibiotics could cure viral infections; 47.5% believed they are effective against cold and flu. Nearly 60% percent of respondents had self-medicated with antibiotics. Married people (adjusted odds ratio (AOR=1.285, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.004-1.643 p=0.046), higher antibiotics use knowledge (AOR=0.818, 95% CI: 0.674-0.993 p=0.042), ever purchased antibiotics without a physician's prescription (AOR=2.024 95% CI: 1.674-2.457 p&#8804;0.001) and storing antibiotics at home (AOR=0.801 95% CI: 0.652-0.985 p=0.035) were significantly associated with self-medication practices.

The prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has added economic, psychological, social, health, and workforce stressors to communities across the United States. Using original research data from workshops held in May 2020 involving emergency management, public health, and related experts to support planning efforts for hurricane evacuation and sheltering, we analyze two key issues: (1) shifting sources of vulnerability in a COVID-19 environment and (2) solutions proposed during the post-lockdown/pre-vaccine time frame. We discuss findings in the context of policy integration options to solidify and expand protections for populations in need of evacuation and sheltering assistance. Findings show that vulnerabilities associated with underlying health conditions and socio-economic disparities were of increased concern to evacuation and shelter planners. Non-congregate options were of interest but were not expected to accommodate all populations in need of public assistance. Registries used in some states offer means with which to evaluate vulnerabilities and align individuals and families with appropriate resources and facilities. There remains a need to expand and standardize existing policies based on COVID-19 operating protocols to ensure inclusivity of socio-economically disadvantaged and disabled individuals in hurricane preparation efforts.","Whytlaw, Jennifer L.; Hutton, Nicole Yusuf Juita-Elena Richardson Tihara Hill Saige Olanrewaju-Lasisi Taiwo Antwi-Nimarko Pamela Landaeta Eduardo Diaz Rafael",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,,333
332254,Prevention and Treatment Approaches in Children with the Coronavirus,2020,"This review focuses on different influential aspects of performing a molecular diagnostic test using standard Real-Time PCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2. Practical hints for performing an accurate test and overcoming potential technical problems that might affect the final result are discussed as well. Moreover, pre-analytical aspects of the test, including standard sampling, sample transfer, and genome extraction are taken into consideration. Briefly, both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were taken in the virus transport medium (VTM), highly recommended to be kept in the cold chain. After primary checks regarding sampling criteria, all samples are aliquoted in screw-capped tubes. This step is considered with the highest potential for contamination and the risk of infection for laboratory technicians. So, it should be performed in biosafety level 2 laminar flow cabinets. Aliquoted samples are then sent to the genome extraction unit. Genomic RNA extraction is performed by different methods, including phenol-chloroform precipitation, silica-based membrane isolation, and magnetic beads. Although precipitation-based methods, mostly performed using TRIzol are associated with higher yields of RNA, the presence of impurities such as proteins, salts, polyphenols, and polysaccharides in the final product is lead to reduced success in the following molecular experiments. Column-based methods, although more expensive, are more user-friendly and result in a more pure product. Extracted RNA is subjected to one-step real-time PCR assay. To perform real-time PCR, it is highly recommended to prepare a reaction mix for all the samples plus one (n+1) which results in the optimum use of kit contents, homogenous solution for all samples, and reduced chance of contamination. Moreover, several control reactions are needed to be included in the assay including negative control, positive control, and no-template control (NTC). Currently, available diagnostic kits of SARS-CoV-2 use mostly the TaqMan probe strategy to detect different viral genes (mostly, E, N, RdRP). Moreover, failure in sampling is investigated through analysis of the amplification of an endogenous internal control gene (mostly RNase P). Based on the manufacturers' instructions, the thermal profile is set in the real-time PCR instrument. This profile commonly includes a hold step for reverse transcription of RNA in ~50 degrees C for 10-30 minutes and another hold step for cDNA pre-denaturation in 95 degrees C for 1-15 minutes. Amplification cycles (not less than 40 cycles) are then applied via the denaturation step and annealing/extension step.","Kiani, J.; Ghorbani, S.; Seif, F.; Khoshmirsafa, M.; Bokharaei, F.",Razi Journal of Medical Sciences,,333
332315,"Overwhelmed by the news: A longitudinal study of prior trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder trajectories, and news watching during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Imaging studies and medical records of sixteen patients (0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C were retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, peritoneum, as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third, senior radiologist. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (10 male and 6 female; 20 months - 20 years). All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included: vomiting (12; 75%), abdominal pain (11; 69%), rash (10;62.5%), conjunctivitis (8;50%), diarrhea (7;44%), headache (6;37.5%), and sore throat (5;31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly (10; 62.5%), congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema (9; 56%), atelectasis (9; 56%), pleural effusions (7; 44%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (2; 12.5%) and pneumonia (1; 6%). Absolute interobserver agreement was 69-100%. Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for PE (6 [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and 2 [25%] by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy). In 2 (25%), CTA demonstrated a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (US and CT) included small volume ascites (6; 38%), hepatomegaly (6; 38%), echogenic kidneys (5; 31%), bowel wall thickening (3; 19%), gallbladder wall thickening (3; 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2; 13%), splenomegaly (1; 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1; 6%). The frequencies of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were: cardiomegaly (12; 75%), pleural effusion (10; 63%) and atelectasis (10; 63%). 15 patients (94%) were discharged home (length of hospital stay 3-20 days). There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular abnormalities, though also solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities as well as ascites, reflecting a multisystemic inflammatory process.

335969,"Improving Survival of Critical Care Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in England: A National Cohort Study, March to June 2020",2020,"Background & objectives: Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some are potential human pathogens. In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods: Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results: Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1. Interpretation & conclusions: This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them. One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health. This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions. Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.","Yadav, Pragya D; Shete-Aich, Anita; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Pardeshi, Prachi; Majumdar, Triparna; Balasubramanian, R; Ullas, Padinjaremattathil Thankappan; Mohandas, Sreelekshmy; Dighe, Hitesh; Sawant, Pradeep; Patil, Savita; Patil, Dilip; Gokhale, M D; Mathapati, Basavaraj; Sudeep, A B; Baradkar, Sreekant; Kumar, Abhimanyu; Kharde, Rutuja; Salve, Malvika; Joshi, Yash; Gupta, Nivedita; Mourya, Devendra T",Indian J Med Res,,333

337232,Sometimes Less Is Worse: A Recommendation Against Nonintubated Video-Assisted Thoracoscopy During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Parents - particularly moms - increasingly consult social media for support when taking decisions about their young children, and likely also when advising other family members such as elderly relatives. Minimizing malignant online influences is therefore crucial to securing their assent for policies ranging from vaccinations, masks and social distancing against the pandemic, to household best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5G towers nearby. Here we show how a strengthening of bonds across online communities during the pandemic, has led to non-Covid-19 conspiracy theories (e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G) attaining heightened access to mainstream parent communities. Alternative health communities act as the critical conduits between conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives more palatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that these inter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespective of any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly why Facebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming of non-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and why targeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvable and empirically grounded mathematical model, shows how modest tailoring of mainstream communities' couplings could prevent them from tipping against establishment guidance. Our conclusions should also apply to other social media platforms and topics.","Johnson, N. F.; Velasquez, N.; Restrepo, N.

338140,Step zero: optimising nutrition for physical and mental health wellbeing during COVID-19,2021,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, has ushered in a new era. It transformed into a pandemic, seized global attention, and was the biggest highlight of the year 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has jeopardized health systems and greatly affected socioeconomic parameters. With global focus on fighting this unpredictable fight with this new virus, the biggest chronic infectious killer, mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), was hugely affected from this shift in attention. Due to certain similarities in the behavior of the two infectious agents, there have been inevitable consequences. On one hand, administrative measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 have simultaneously led to a breaking in the chain of tuberculosis (TB) management. Consequently, a regression occurred in the milestones achieved in the battle against TB. On the other hand, the same measures and heightened hygiene awareness has helped to decrease the spread of the TB bacilli. With an improved understanding of the interrelations and the outcomes noticed in 2020, we can better gear ourselves to develop a more sophisticated and robust strategy to tilt the balance against TB. Keeping this in mind, in this review we aim to discuss in detail the implications of SARS-CoV-2 on an already unwavering health hazard: TB.","Kant, S.; Tyagi, R.",Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease,,333

338877,Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 in skin of color: a firsthand perspective of three cases in a tertiary care center in India,2020,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell is an effective therapy in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphomas that, due to its unique toxicities, often requires escalation of care to the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin are serum inflammatory markers associated with onset and persistence of CAR T-cell-related toxicity. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) who were divided into two groups: patients requiring admission to the ICU during initial hospitalization (nâ¯=â¯13, 38%) and those who did not (nâ¯=â¯21, 62%). Primary objective was to examine possible relationships between serum ferritin and/or CRP levels with the need for, and length of, ICU stay between these groups. RESULTS: All 13 patients admitted to the ICU developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 11 of them also developed neurotoxicity (NT). Of the 21 patients in the non-ICU group, 18 developed CRS and 5 patients developed NT. Grade of CRS and NT were higher in ICU versus non-ICU patients (pâ¯=â¯.03 and .001, respectively). There was no correlation between CRP levels at time of ICU admission and length of ICU stay (correlation of 0.41, pâ¯=â¯.17). Yet, there was an association between serum ferritin levels and length of ICU stay (R2â¯=â¯0.73) which did not reach statistical significance (correlation of 0.21, pâ¯=â¯.49). CONCLUSION: Notwithstanding the limitations of the small sample size, our study suggests that an elevated ferritin level at the time of escalation of medical care may be possibly indicative of anticipated prolonged ICU hospitalization in patients treated with axi-cel. A large multicenter study is certainly needed to confirm this observation.","Melody, Megan; Rahman, Zaid Abdel; Saunders, Hollie; Diaz, Paula Lengerke; Gannon, Nicole; Rosenthal, Allison; Ayala, Ernesto; Tun, Han W; Murthy, Hemant; Roy, Vivek; Foran, James; Castro, Januario E; Guru, Pramod; Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A",Hematol. oncol. stem cell ther,,333

The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has elevated these concerns due to increased risk factors pertaining to social, family, economic, and health stressors, in addition to changes to typical routines and support systems. Unfortunately, there are many barriers to at-risk youth being able to access evidence-based mental health services including cost, lack of trained providers, transportation issues, and physical distancing due to the pandemic. Providing school-based prevention and intervention programs that promote social, emotional, and behavioral well-being helps to address many of these barriers. This article highlights important considerations to providing these services in a school-based telehealth modality. Symptom clusters that put youth at risk of harm to self are described. Best practice therapeutic modalities that can be disseminated in a school-based telehealth modality, such as cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based approaches, are reviewed. Although there is growing empirical literature for these school-based prevention and intervention approaches, additional research is needed to determine how to best support at-risk youth remotely.","Holland, Melissa; Hawks, Jessica; Morelli, Lauren C; Khan, Zainab",Contemp Sch Psychol,,333

342959,Demand and supply of invasive and noninvasive ventilators at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Okinawa,2020,"BACKGROUND: During transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a coil placed on the scalp is used to non-invasively modulate activity of targeted brain networks via a magnetically induced electric field (E-field). Ideally, the E-field induced during TMS is concentrated on a targeted cortical region of interest (ROI). Determination of the coil position and orientation that best achieve this objective presently requires a large computational effort. OBJECTIVE: To improve the accuracy of TMS we have developed a fast computational auxiliary dipole method (ADM) for determining the optimum coil position and orientation. The optimum coil placement maximizes the E-field along a predetermined direction or, alternatively, the overall E-field magnitude in the targeted ROI. Furthermore, ADM can assess E-field uncertainty resulting from precision limitations of TMS coil placement protocols. METHOD: ADM leverages the electromagnetic reciprocity principle to compute rapidly the TMS induced E-field in the ROI by using the E-field generated by a virtual constant current source residing in the ROI. The framework starts by solving for the conduction currents resulting from this ROI current source. Then, it rapidly determines the average E-field induced in the ROI for each coil position by using the conduction currents and a fast-multipole method. To further speed-up the computations, the coil is approximated using auxiliary dipoles enabling it to represent all coil orientations for a given coil position with less than 600 dipoles. RESULTS: Using ADM, the E-fields generated in an MRI-derived head model when the coil is placed at 5,900 different scalp positions and 360 coil orientations per position (over 2.1 million unique configurations) can be determined in under 15 minutes on a standard laptop computer. This enables rapid extraction of the optimum coil position and orientation as well as the E-field variation resulting from coil positioning uncertainty. ADM is implemented in SimNIBS 3.2. CONCLUSION: ADM enables the rapid determination of coil placement that maximizes E-field delivery to a specific brain target. This method can find the optimum coil placement in under 15 minutes enabling its routine use for TMS. Furthermore, it enables the fast quantification of uncertainty in the induced E-field due to limited precision of TMS coil placement protocols, enabling minimization and statistical analysis of the E-field dose variability.","Gomez, Luis J; Dannhauer, Moritz; Peterchev, Angel V",Neuroimage,,333

The objective of this study was to estimate eligibility for LT in a cohort of pCCA patients in two tertiary referral centers. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with pCCA between 2002 and 2014 were included from two tertiary referral centers in the Netherlands. The selection criteria used by the Mayo Clinic were retrospectively applied to determine the proportion of patients that would have been eligible for LT. RESULTS: A total of 732 consecutive patients with pCCA were identified, of whom 24 (4%) had PSC-associated pCCA. Overall, 154 patients had resectable disease on imaging and 335 patients were ineligible for LT because of lymph node or distant metastases. An age limit of 70 years led to the exclusion of 50 patients who would otherwise be eligible for LT. After applying the Mayo Clinic criteria, only 34 patients (5%) were potentially eligible for LT. Median survival from diagnosis for these 34 patients was 13 months (95% CI 3-23). CONCLUSION: Only 5% of all patients presenting with pCCA were potentially eligible for LT under the Mayo criteria.

Participants: 266 university students, but only 49 were undergoing psychological treatment during the Covid-19 lockdown at the center. Methods: (1) Semistructured interview; (2) Questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic information and ad hoc questions; and (3) Scl-90-r test. Results and Conclusions: Aim 1: The main results highlight high levels of anxiety and stress, concentration disorders, and psychosomatization. In several cases, there was a reactivation of previous traumas and sleep was found qualitatively compromised. Aim 2: Counseling services included telephone listening activities, online psychological interviews, psychoeducational groups for interventions of anxiety management, and workshops on study methods conducted in small groups. The online counseling intervention, in times of emergency, increased the resilience and identified any psychological problems in order to implement timely management.","Savarese, Giulia; Curcio, Luigi; D039,; Elia, Daniela; Fasano, Oreste; Pecoraro, Nadia",,,333

345816,Stress management techniques for healthcare workers as an important professional tool to fight (not only) COVID-19 pandemics,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. METHODS: The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists. RESULTS: All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should undergo a comprehensive daily CBC with manual WBC differential to monitor for numerical and morphologic changes predictive of poor outcome and signs of disease progression.","Pozdnyakova, Olga; Connell, Nathan T; Battinelli, Elisabeth M; Connors, Jean M; Fell, Geoffrey; Kim, Annette S",Am. j. clin. pathol,,333

348068,Institutional Psychotherapy during confinement situation: Adaptation of the therapeutic setting in a day hospital. Towards a virtual mental institution,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To identify, characterise and explain factors that influence patient preferences, from the perspective of patients and clinicians, for virtual consultations in an orthopaedic rehabilitation setting. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and abductive analysis. SETTING: A physiotherapy and occupational therapy department situated within a tertiary orthopaedic centre in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who were receiving orthopaedic rehabilitation for a musculoskeletal problem. Occupational therapists, physiotherapists or therapy technicians involved in the delivery of orthopaedic rehabilitation for patients with a musculoskeletal problem. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients and 22 healthcare professionals were interviewed. The average interview length was 48 minutes. Four major factors were found to influence preference: the situation of care (the ways that patients understand and explain their clinical status, their treatment requirements and the care pathway), the expectations of care (influenced by a patients desire for contact, psychological status, previous care and perceived requirements), the demands on the patient (due to each patients respective social situation and the consequences of choice) and the capacity to allocate resources to care (these include financial, infrastructural, social and healthcare resources). CONCLUSION: This study has identified key factors that appear to influence patient preference for virtual consultations in orthopaedic rehabilitation. A conceptual model of these factors, derived from empirical data, has been developed highlighting how they combine and compete. A series of questions, based on these factors, have been developed to support identification of preferences in a clinical setting.","Gilbert, Anthony W; Jones, Jeremy; Stokes, Maria; May, Carl R",BMJ Open,,333

METHODS: We performed an evaluation of 2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays with a more detailed look into the effect of immune status on antibody sensitivity. RESULTS: Both assays demonstrated 100% specificity. The overall sensitivity of the Roche was 92.1% at &#8805;14 days and 94.8% at &#8805;21 days, and the overall sensitivity of the Abbott was 94.4% at &#8805;14 days and 98.2% at &#8805;21 days. 7/41 (17%) of patients included in this cohort were immunocompromised. Seroconversion was seen less commonly in the immunocompromised (4/7 [57.1%] seroconverted) and after excluding these patients 100% sensitivity was seen in both assays at &#8805;21 days. DISCUSSION: Performance of both assays in the immunocompetent appeared excellent after 21 days postsymptom onset.

METHODS: This was a prospective study that enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) followed at a primary healthcare unit in São Paulo, Brazil. After a brief training in image acquisition, there was further continuous feedback given by a retina specialist during the remote image reading process. Each patient underwent two fundus and one anterior ocular segment images per eye, after mydriasis. Patients were classified according to the need of referral. RESULTS: A total of 627 adult individuals with T2DM underwent retinal evaluation. The population was composed by 63.2% female individuals, age median of 66 years, diabetes duration 10.7 ± 8.2 years and HbA1c 7.7 ± 1.9% (61 + 20.8 mmol/mol). The most prevalent associated comorbidities were arterial hypertension (80.3%) and dyslipidemia (50.2%). Referral decision was possible in 81.2% patients. Most patients had absent or non-referable DR; the main ocular media opacity detected was cataract. After the 7th day of image acquisition, the daily rate of patients whose images allowed clinical decision was maintained above 80%. A higher HbA1c was associated with referable DR. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost DR screening strategy with a handheld device and telemedicine is feasible and has the potential to increase coverage of DR screening in underserved areas; the possibility of mobile units is relevant for DR screening in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.

352476,"COVID-19 can suddenly become severe: a case series from Tokyo, Japan",2020,"Control strategies that employ real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 epidemic are inefficient in fighting the epidemic due to high cost, delays in obtaining results, and the need of specialized personnel and equipment for laboratory processing. Cheaper and faster alternatives, such as antigen and paper-strip tests, have been proposed. They return results rapidly, but have lower sensitivity thresholds for detecting virus. To quantify the effects of the tradeoffs between sensitivity, cost, testing frequency, and delay in test return on the overall course of an outbreak, we built a multi-scale immuno-epidemiological model that connects the virus profile of infected individuals with transmission and testing at the population level. We investigated various randomized testing strategies and found that, for fixed testing capacity, lower sensitivity tests with shorter return delays slightly flatten the daily incidence curve and delay the time to the peak daily incidence. However, compared with RT-PCR testing, they do not always reduce the cumulative case count at half a year into the outbreak. When testing frequency is increased to account for the lower cost of less sensitive tests, we observe a large reduction in cumulative case counts, from 55.4% to as low as 1.22% half a year into the outbreak. The improvement is preserved even when the testing budget is reduced by one half or one third. Our results predict that surveillance testing that employs low-sensitivity tests at high frequency is an effective tool for epidemic control.","Forde, Jonathan E; Ciupe, Stanca M",Viruses,,333

Patients with Asthma are at higher risk if they tract the novel Coronavirus. As the coronavirus continues to spread, hospitals are turning to use more salbutamol MDI. Salbutamol MDI has become the line of defence for physicians in the emergency room who are treating patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and have respiratory distress.[Hui et al 2020,and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 2020] During the COVID pandemic, there has been a drastic increase in the use of MDI inhalers; therefore, it led to a decrease in availability and a break in the supply chain. Patients with Asthma are at higher risk if they tract the novel Coronavirus, and an inhaler could be a life or death for them. As the coronavirus continues to spread, hospitals are turning to use more salbutamol Metered Dose inhaler (MDI). Salbutamol MDI is now on short supply as the COVID-19 continues to spread. Salbutamol MDI has become the line of defence for physicians in the emergency room who are treating patients with COVID-19 and have respiratory distress. The current shortage of salbutamol MDI could be a result of stockpiling and hoarding of this life-saving inhaler. That had led to a critical shortage of Salbutamol MDI, and even the case shortage continues with some other alternatives such as Ipratropium MDI and even with long-acting B-agonists such as Salmeterol and Formoterol which also starting to have a limitation on ordering these agents. Coronavirus sparks fear of medication shortage. Coronavirus panic-buying also may have led to a shortage of critical inhalers. We have also got elderly patients with COPD who may need Ventolin MDI and also premature babies who may have caught Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and need salbutamol MDI to support their lungs have since been compromised, and they rely heavily on Asthma inhalers.

We use this model to capture the semantics of transformations that exploit data parallelism available in Unix shell computations and prove their correctness. We additionally formalize the translations from the Unix shell to the dataflow model and from the dataflow model back to a parallel shell script. We implement our model and transformations as the compiler and optimization passes of a system parallelizing shell pipelines, and use it to evaluate the speedup achieved on 47 pipelines.","Handa, Shivam; Kallas, Konstantinos; Vasilakis, Nikos; Rinard, Martin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15422v2.pdf,333

Can demographic and socioeconomic indicators explain differential mortality?,2021,"The impact of restrictions during various phases of COVID-19 lockdown on daily mean PM2.5 concentration in five Indian megacities (New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad) was studied. The impact was studied for pre-lockdown (1st Mar-24th Mar 2020), lockdown (25th Mar-31st May 2020), and unlocking (1st Jun-31st Aug 2020) phases. The lockdown period comprises 4 lockdown phases with distinct measures, whereas the unlocking period had 3 phases. PM2.5 concentration reduced significantly in all megacities and met the national standards during the lockdown period. The maximum reduction in PM2.5 level was observed in Kolkata (62%), followed by Mumbai (49%), Chennai (34%), and New Delhi (26%) during the lockdown period. Comparatively, Hyderabad exhibited a smaller reduction in PM2.5 concentration, i.e., 10%. The average PM2.5 levels during the lockdown in the peak hour (i.e., 07:00-11:00 h) in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad decreased by 21.3%, 48.5%, 63.4%, 56.4%, and 23.8%, respectively, compared to those before lockdown period. During the unlocking period, except for Chennai, all megacities showed a reduction in average PM2.5 levels compared to concentrations in the lockdown period, but these reductions were mainly linked with monsoon rains in India. The current study provided an opportunity to study air pollution in the absence of major anthropogenic activities and during limited activities in monsoon season having an ecological design. The study reports a new baseline of PM2.5, except for monsoon, and explores this knowledge to plan future air pollution reduction strategies. The study also discusses how this new learning of knowledge could strengthen air pollution control policies for better air quality and sustainability.Graphical abstract.","Ravindra, Khaiwal; Singh, Tanbir; Biswal, Akash; Singh, Vikas; Mor, Suman",,,333
355071,The future of the independent practice after covid,2020,"Pacific Island countries (PIC) have emerged as among the most at-risk globally from the collateral economic damage resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being largely spared its direct health effects so far. Current projections indicate that all PIC will experience an economic contraction in 2020, ranging from -1.0% in Tuvalu to -21.7% in Fiji, worse than most countries globally on average. Given that more than 80% of financing for health in the Pacific comes from domestic and external public sources, the net impact of the economic contraction on resources for health will depend on whether overall public spending can offset the decline in economic activity and how health will be prioritized in government budgets relative to other sectors. Without active reprioritization, most countries could see a slowdown or even decline in per capita levels of public spending for health in the region, risking gains made in advancing universal health coverage in recent years. If health ministries do not act quickly and in consort with other ministries (particularly ministries of finance), including by taking active steps to improve the efficient use of existing resources and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the crisis on resources for health, it is likely that current economic circumstances will result in unplanned changes. These changes may not deliver the health outcomes that the health ministries would select themselves and may result in a reversal of hard-fought health gains.","Tandon, Ajay; Ivatts, Susan; Cowley, Peter; Roubal, Tomas; Dodd, Rebecca; Pepperall, Jane; Mikkelsen-Lopez, Inez; Irava, Wayne Jeremy; Palu, Toomas",Health Syst Reform,,333

The purpose of this paper is to provide a scientific reference for the global prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS: General demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were collected that had been reported on the websites of multiple Municipal Health Commissions in China. We herein describe distributions in time, place, and population of COVID-19. RESULTS: As of midnight on February 10, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was 42,638, and the province with the largest number of confirmed cases was Hubei (31728), followed by Guangdong (1177), Zhejiang (1117), and Henan (1105) province. The number of cases and the speed of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei were more moderate than those of the Hubei province. The median (interquartile range) age of patients with COVID-19 was 44 (33, 54) years, with a range of 10 months to 89 years.

355784,COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Ontario and British Columbia,2020,"Central to developing effective control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic is understanding the epidemiology of transmission in the community. Geospatial analysis of neighborhood-level data could provide insight into drivers of infection. In the current analysis of Harris County, Texas, we used custom interpolation tools in GIS to disaggregate COVID-19 incidence estimates from the zip code to census tract estimates-a better representation of neighborhood-level estimates. We assessed the associations between 29 neighborhood-level characteristics and COVID-19 incidence using a series of aspatial and spatial models. The variables that maintained significant and positive associations with COVID-19 incidence in our final aspatial model and later represented in a geographically weighted regression model were the percentage of the Black/African American population, percentage of the foreign-born population, area derivation index (ADI), percentage of households with no vehicle, and percentage of people over 65 years old inside each census tract. Conversely, we observed negative and significant association with the percentage employed in education. Notably, the spatial models indicated that the impact of ADI was homogeneous across the study area, but other risk factors varied by neighborhood.

355829,Survey of laboratory medicine's national response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland,2021,"We propose using a permutation test to detect discontinuities in an underlying economic model at a cutoff point. Relative to the existing literature, we show that this test is well suited for event studies based on time-series data. The test statistic measures the distance between the empirical distribution functions of observed data in two local subsamples on the two sides of the cutoff. Critical values are computed via a standard permutation algorithm. Under a high-level condition that the observed data can be coupled by a collection of conditionally independent variables, we establish the asymptotic validity of the permutation test, allowing the sizes of the local subsamples to be either be fixed or grow to infinity. In the latter case, we also establish that the permutation test is consistent. We demonstrate that our high-level condition can be verified in a broad range of problems in the infill asymptotic time-series setting, which justifies using the permutation test to detect jumps in economic variables such as volatility, trading activity, and liquidity.

The high pulmonary tropism and contagiousness of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have stimulated new approaches to combat its widespread diffusion. In developing new pharmacological strategies, the chemical characteristic of volatility can add therapeutic value to the hypothetical drug candidate. Volatile molecules are characterized by a high vapor pressure and are consequently easily exhaled by the lungs after ingestion. This feature could be exploited from a pharmacological point of view, reaching the site of action in an uncommon way but allowing for drug delivery. In this way, a hypothetical molecule for COVID-19 should have a balance between its lung exhalation characteristics and both antiviral and anti-inflammatory pharmacological action. Here, the feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages of a therapy based on oral administration of possible volatile drugs for COVID-19 will be discussed. Both aerosolized antiviral therapy and oral intake of volatile molecules are briefly reviewed, and an evaluation of 1,8-cineole is provided in view of a possible clinical use and also for asymptomatic COVID-19.","Colalto, Cristiano",Drug dev. res,,333

357464,Coronavirus and People with Intellectual Disabilities: A Special Perspective,2021,"The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak hit the global economy like a tsunami. Every aspect of human society, including the energy industry and market, is affected by this pandemic. The pandemic has affected prices, demand, supply, investment, and several other aspects of the energy sector, including the oil and gas industry. This article is aimed to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 on the oil and gas industry and give a perspective of the post-COVID-19 oil and gas market. Results of this article show that COVID-19 impacts the oil and gas industry. The short-term impact is nearly 25% decrease in petroleum consumption, slowly recovering to its former amount and even growing more. The long-term impacts are the 30% to 40% decrease in the CAPEX and R&D investments over the oil and gas market, which is a regional scale in the United States, caused oil exploitation projects to decrease from more than 800 in 2019 to 265 in 2021. And it is predicted to reduce the competitiveness of oil and gas vs other energy carriers such as ever price-decreasing renewable energies. Thus, the oil and gas industry has to change rapidly before losing a substantial energy market share. Finally, this article discusses acknowledging oil and gas trade as a part of World trade organization (WTO/ECT) regulations. And considering it a general energy commodity. An act that reduces the freedom of action of oil-exporting governments and great oil cartels and protects their interests in a globalizing competitive energy market.","Norouzi, Nima",,,333
357583,"Professional and Ethical Issues in United States Acute Care Physical Therapists Treating Patients With COVID-19: Stress, Walls, and Uncertainty",2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent research has shown that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation on people's mental health are quite extensive, but there are limited studies on the effects of the pandemic on patients with mental health disorders. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who have previously sought treatment for a mental health disorder. METHODS: This study uses the newly developed Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) survey. This tool was designed to assess tangible impacts of epidemics and pandemics across personal and social life domains. From November 9, 2020, to February 18, 2021, a total of 245 adults recruited from a mental health clinic completed the consent form and responded to the survey link from the Siyan Clinical Corporation and Siyan Clinical Research practices located in Santa Rosa, California, USA. RESULTS: We found that the least affected age group included individuals aged 75 years or older. This was followed closely by the 65- to 75-year-old age group. People with children under the age of 18 years also reported both more negative indicators associated with the pandemic and more positive indicators compared to those without children at home. Gender queer, nonconforming, and transgender individuals may also be at higher risk for more negative impacts associated with the pandemic. When respondents were assessed with regard to their mental health diagnosis, no differences were noted. Substance use also increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the data collected here may serve as foundational research in the prevention, care, and treatment of mental health disorders during pandemics such as COVID-19. Populations such as those with previously diagnosed mental health disorders are particularly at risk for negative effects of pandemic-related stressors such as social isolation, especially if they have children in the household, are part of a younger age group, or have substance use disorder. Gender may also be a factor. Further, the EPII survey may prove to be a useful tool in understanding these effects. Overall, these data may be a critical step toward understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations with a mental health diagnosis, which may aid mental health practitioners in understanding the consequences of pandemics on their patients' overall well-being.

This work makes an assessment of wildlife susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing the similarities of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) -both recognized as receptors and protease for coronavirus spike protein- and the genetic variation of the viral protein spike in the recognition sites. The sequences from different mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and the sequence from SARS-CoV-2 S protein were obtained from the GenBank. Comparisons of aligned sequences were made by selecting amino acids residues of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and S protein; phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the same sequences. The species susceptibility was ranked by substituting the values of amino acid residues for both proteins. Our results ranked primates at the top, but surprisingly, just below are carnivores, cetaceans and wild rodents, showing a relatively high potential risk, as opposed to lab rodents that are typically mammals at lower risk. Most of the sequences from birds, reptiles and amphibians occupied the lowest ranges in the analyses. Models and phylogenetic trees outputs showed the species that are more prone to getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, during this short pandemic period, a high haplotypic variation was observed in the RBD of the viral S protein, suggesting new risks for other hosts. Our findings are consistent with other published results reporting laboratory and natural infections in different species. Finally, urgent measures of wildlife monitoring are needed regarding SARS-CoV-2, as well as measures for avoiding or limiting human contact with wildlife, and precautionary measures to protect wildlife workers and researchers; monitoring disposal of waste and sewage than can potentially affect the environment, and designing protocols for dealing with the outbreak.","Martínez-Hernández, Fernando; Isaak-Delgado, Ana Belem; Alfonso-Toledo, Jorge Alberto; Muñoz-García, Claudia Irais; Villalobos, Guiehdani; Aréchiga-Ceballos, Nidia; Rendón-Franco, Emilio",,,333

14 %) and those with coexisting conditions (10 % for those with cardiovascular disease and 7 % for those with diabetes) (Emanuel et al in N Engl J Med 2020) Overall, Covid-19 is substantially deadlier than seasonal influenza, which has a mortality of roughly 0 1 % Public health efforts depend heavily on predicting how diseases such as those caused by Covid-19 spread across the globe During the early days of a new outbreak, when reliable data are still scarce, researchers turn to mathematical models that can predict where people who could be infected are going and how likely they are to bring the disease with them These computational methods use known statistical equations that calculate the probability of individuals transmitting the illness Modern computational power allows these models to quickly incorporate multiple inputs, such as a given disease’s ability to pass from person to person and the movement patterns of potentially infected people traveling by air and land This process sometimes involves making assumptions about unknown factors, such as an individual’s exact travel pattern By plugging in different possible versions of each input, however, researchers can update the models as new information becomes available and compare their results to observed patterns for the illness In this paper we describe the development a model of Corona spread by using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools We leveraged our experience from research in modeling Ebola spread (Shaw et al Modeling Ebola Spread and Using HPCC/KEL System In: Big Data Technologies and Applications 2016 (pp 347-385) Springer, Cham) to successfully model Corona spread, we will obtain new results, and help in reducing the number of Corona patients We closely collaborated with LexisNexis, which is a leading US data analytics company and a member of our NSF I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement The lack of a comprehensive view and informative analysis of the status of the pandemic can also cause panic and instability within society Our work proposes the HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker, which provides a multi-level view of the pandemic with the informative virus spreading indicators in a timely manner The system embeds a classical epidemiological model known as SIR and spreading indicators based on causal model The data solution of the tracker is built on top of the Big Data processing platform HPCC Systems, from ingesting and tracking of various data sources to fast delivery of the data to the public The HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker presents the Covid-19 data on a daily, weekly, and cumulative basis up to global-level and down to the county-level It also provides statistical analysis for each level such as new cases per 100,000 population The primary analysis such as Contagion Risk and Infection State is based on causal model with a seven-day sliding window Our work has been released as a publicly available website to the world and attracted a great volume of traffic The project is open-sourced and available on GitHub The system was developed on the LexisNexis HPCC Systems, which is briefly described in the paper","Villanustre, Flavio Chala Arjuna Dev Roger Xu Lili LexisNexis Jesse Shaw Furht Borko Khoshgoftaar Taghi",Journal of Big Data,,333

360590,In Conversation with a Frontline Worker in a Care Home in Sweden during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Mortality and morbidity from SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infections in children remains low, including an exceedingly low rate of horizontal and vertical transmission. However, unforeseen complications to childhood health have emerged secondary to the pandemic. Few studies to date have examined unintended complications of the pandemic in newborns and infants. In this Commentary, we discuss the impact that COVID-19 may have on inheritance of the newborn microbiome and its assembly throughout the first years of life. In the early stages of the pandemic when vertical transmission of COVID-19 was poorly understood, several studies reported increased rates of C-sections in COVID-19 positive women. Initial recommendations discouraged COVID-19 positive mothers from breastfeeding and participating in skin-to-skin care, advising them to isolate during their window of infectivity. These shifts in perinatal care can adversely impact microbial colonization during the first 1000 days of life. While obstetrical and neonatal management have evolved to reflect our current knowledge of perinatal transmission, we are observing other changes in early life exposures of infants, including increased attention to hygiene, fewer social interactions, and decreased global travel, all of which are major drivers of early-life gut colonization. Composition of the gut microbiota in adults directly impacts severity of infection, suggesting a role of microbial communities in modulating immune responses to COVID-19. Conversely, the role of the intestinal microbiome in susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in newborns and children remains unknown. The onset of adulthood diseases is related to the establishment of a healthy gut microbiome during childhood. As we continue to define COVID-19 biology, further research is necessary to understand how acquisition of the neonatal microbiome is affected by the pandemic. Furthermore, infection control measures must be balanced with strategies that promote microbial diversity to impart optimal health outcomes and potentially modulate susceptibility of children to COVID-19.","Romano-Keeler, Joann; Zhang, Jilei; Sun, Jun",Gut Microbes,,333

361393,Telemedicine experiences at a pediatric endocrinology clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cancer diagnostics and surgery have been disrupted by the response of health care services to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Progression of cancers during delay will impact on patients' long-term survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We generated per-day hazard ratios of cancer progression from observational studies and applied these to age-specific, stage-specific cancer survival for England 2013-2017. We modelled per-patient delay of 3 and 6 months and periods of disruption of 1 and 2 years. Using health care resource costing, we contextualise attributable lives saved and life-years gained (LYGs) from cancer surgery to equivalent volumes of COVID-19 hospitalisations. RESULTS: Per year, 94 912 resections for major cancers result in 80 406 long-term survivors and 1 717 051 LYGs. Per-patient delay of 3/6 months would cause attributable death of 4755/10 760 of these individuals with loss of 92 214/208 275 life-years, respectively. For cancer surgery, average LYGs per patient are 18.1 under standard conditions and 17.1/15.9 with a delay of 3/6 months (an average loss of 0.97/2.19 LYGs per patient), respectively. Taking into account health care resource units (HCRUs), surgery results on average per patient in 2.25 resource-adjusted life-years gained (RALYGs) under standard conditions and 2.12/1.97 RALYGs following delay of 3/6 months. For 94 912 hospital COVID-19 admissions, there are 482 022 LYGs requiring 1 052 949 HCRUs. Hospitalisation of community-acquired COVID-19 patients yields on average per patient 5.08 LYG and 0.46 RALYGs. CONCLUSIONS: Modest delays in surgery for cancer incur significant impact on survival. Delay of 3/6 months in surgery for incident cancers would mitigate 19%/43% of LYGs, respectively, by hospitalisation of an equivalent volume of admissions for community-acquired COVID-19. This rises to 26%/59%, respectively, when considering RALYGs. To avoid a downstream public health crisis of avoidable cancer deaths, cancer diagnostic and surgical pathways must be maintained at normal throughput, with rapid attention to any backlog already accrued.","Sud, A; Jones, M E; Broggio, J; Loveday, C; Torr, B; Garrett, A; Nicol, D L; Jhanji, S; Boyce, S A; Gronthoud, F; Ward, P; Handy, J M; Yousaf, N; Larkin, J; Suh, Y-E; Scott, S; Pharoah, P D P; Swanton, C; Abbosh, C; Williams, M; Lyratzopoulos, G; Houlston, R; Turnbull, C",Ann Oncol,,333

We aimed to identify associations between clinical and radiographic features as well as to assess the feasibility of deep learning applied to chest X-rays in the setting of an acute COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A retrospective study of X-rays, clinical, and laboratory data was performed from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (age 60±17 years, 15 women) between February 22 and March 6, 2020 from a tertiary care hospital in Milan, Italy. Sixty-five chest X-rays were reviewed by two radiologists for alveolar and interstitial opacities and classified by severity on a scale from 0 to 3. Clinical factors (age, symptoms, comorbidities) were investigated for association with opacity severity and also with placement of central line or endotracheal tube. Deep learning models were then trained for two tasks: lung segmentation and opacity detection. Imaging characteristics were compared to clinical datapoints using the unpaired student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate the concordance of deep learning to conventional radiologist interpretation. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of patients presented with alveolar opacities, 73% had interstitial opacities, and 23% had normal X-rays. The presence of alveolar or interstitial opacities was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.008) and comorbidities (P = 0.005). The extent of alveolar or interstitial opacities on baseline X-ray was significantly associated with the presence of endotracheal tube (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.049) or central line (P = 0.003 and P = 0.007). In comparison to human interpretation, the deep learning model achieved a kappa concordance of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities. CONCLUSION: Chest X-ray analysis in an acute COVID-19 outbreak showed that the severity of opacities was associated with advanced age, comorbidities, as well as acuity of care. Artificial intelligence tools based upon deep learning of COVID-19 chest X-rays are feasible in the acute outbreak setting.","Blain, Maxime; T Kassin, Michael; Varble, Nicole; Wang, Xiaosong; Xu, Ziyue; Xu, Daguang; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Vespro, Valentina; Stellato, Elvira; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Di Meglio, Letizia; D Suh, Robert; A Walker, Stephanie; Xu, Sheng; H Sanford, Thomas; B Turkbey, Evrim; Harmon, Stephanie; Turkbey, Baris; J Wood, Bradford",Diagn. interv. radiol,,333

At the time we write this article, our country is facing a community spread phase, expecting a rapid increase in the number of cases and fatalities. The Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara has been declared a non-COVID-19 hospital with the mission of providing care to patients already registered and also those transferred from neurosurgical departments of neighboring centers, which have been converted into COVID-19 only hospitals. Methods: An organized response regarding personnel, surgical case selection, operating room behavior, and facility reorganization were designed to prevent an internal coronavirus outbreak in the neurosurgery department at the Fray Antonio Alcalde Civil Hospital of Guadalajara. Results: Distancing actions by the staff and residents, including ward case discussions, neurosurgery rounds, and classes, will be carried out virtually. We classified neurosurgical patients into 4 groups depending on whether their condition demands care in 0-6 hours, 6-48 hours, 48 hours to 14 days, and >14 days. Subsequently, a questionnaire with epidemiologic, radiologic, clinical, and serologic criteria will be applied to determine the risk of COVID-19 infection to define to which area they are going to be transferred according to the different risk zones in our facility. Conclusions: Despite not being a COVID-19 center, we consider all patients at the neurosurgical ward and staff members as asymptomatic carriers or infected in the preclinical period. Specific measures must be taken to ensure the safety and care of neurosurgical patients and medical staff during the community spread phase.","Núñez-Velasco, Santiago; Mercado-Pimentel, Rodrigo; Ochoa-Plascencia, Miguel; Rodríguez-Arias, Regina; Lopez-Espinoza, Gerardo; González-González, Maria Elena; Estrella-Sánchez, Carlos; Ramírez-Huerta, Carlos",World Neurosurg,,333

366075,Management of a case of pemphigus foliaceus in a paraplegic man with palliative dermatology principles during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19, a novel infectious disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, affected millions of people around the world with a high mortality rate. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes lung infection, gastrointestinal symptoms described in COVID-19 patients and detection of the viral RNA in feces of infected patients drove attentions to a possible fecal-oral transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. However, not only the viral RNA but also the infectious viral particles are required for the viral infection and no proof has been demonstrated the transmission of the infectious virus particles via the fecal-oral route yet. Growing evidence indicates the crosstalk between gut microbiota and lung, that maintains host homeostasis and disease development with the association of immune system. This gut-lung interaction may influence the COVID-19 severity in patients with extrapulmonary conditions. Severity of COVID-19 has mostly associated with old ages and underlying medical conditions. Since the diversity in the gut microbiota decreases during aging, dysbiosis could be the reason for older adults being at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19. We believe that gut microbiota contributes to the course of COVID-19 due to its bidirectional relationship with immune system and lung. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota results in gut permeability leading to secondary infection and multiple organ failure. Conversely, disruption of the gut barrier integrity due to dysbiosis may lead to translocation of SARS-CoV-2 from the lung into the intestinal lumen via circulatory and lymphatic system. This review points out the role of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota involving in sepsis, on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, this review aims to clarify the ambiguity in fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Aktas, Busra; Aslim, Belma",Turk. J. Biol.,,333

The aim of the present work was to develop and validate a two-dimensional isotope-dilution liquid chromatrography tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS) method for accurate quantification of remdesivir and its active metabolite GS-441524, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in serum; drugs that have gained attention for repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Following protein precipitation, samples were separated with a two-dimensional ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (2D-UHPLC) setup, consisting of an online solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to an analytical column. For quantification, stable isotope-labelled analogues were used as internal standards for all analytes. The method was validated on the basis of the European Medicines Agency bioanalytical method validation protocol. RESULTS: Detuning of lopinavir and ritonavir allowed simultaneous quantification of all analytes with different concentration ranges and sensitivity with a uniform injection volume of 5 µL. The method provided robust validation results with inaccuracy and imprecision values of &#8804; 9.59 % and &#8804; 11.1 % for all quality controls. CONCLUSION: The presented method is suitable for accurate and simultaneous quantification of remdesivir, its metabolite GS-441525, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, favipiravir and azithromycin in human serum. The quantitative assay may be an efficient tool for the therapeutic drug monitoring of these potential drug candidates in COVID-19 patients in order to increase treatment efficacy and safety.","Habler, Katharina; Brügel, Mathias; Teupser, Daniel; Liebchen, Uwe; Scharf, Christina; Schönermarck, Ulf; Vogeser, Michael; Paal, Michael",J Pharm Biomed Anal,,333

Our results showed that sequential immunization with adenovirus vectored vaccine followed by inactivated/recombinant subunit/mRNA vaccine administration specifically increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and promoted the modulation of antibody responses to predominantly neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, a heterologous prime-boost regimen with an adenovirus vector vaccine also improved Th1-biased T cell responses.

So far, belief updating has been investigated in partly unrelated lines of research from different psychological disciplines. In this article, we aim to integrate these disparate lines of research. After presenting some prominent theoretical frameworks and experimental designs that have been used for the study of belief updating, we review how healthy people and people with mental disorders update their beliefs after receiving new information that supports or challenges their views. Available evidence suggests that both healthy people and people with particular mental disorders are prone to certain biases when updating their beliefs, although the nature of the respective biases varies considerably and depends on several factors. Anomalies in belief updating are discussed in terms of both new insights into the psychopathology of various mental disorders and societal implications, such as irreconcilable political and societal controversies due to the failure to take information into account that disconfirms one's own view. We conclude by proposing a novel integrative model of belief updating and derive directions for future research.","Kube, Tobias; Rozenkrantz, Liron",Perspect Psychol Sci,,333
374690,"Letter to the Editor ""Incorporating Telehealth to Improve Neurosurgical Training During the COVID-19 Pandemic""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus infection Disease 19 impacted every part of the world and routine life. Recent report from the Office of national statistics in UK reported disproportionate death among Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) population. NHS is heavily relied on the BAME work force both in front line and in the community. We attempted to explore the beliefs and perception about reported worrying issue among BAME health work force in a Diverse city of Leicester. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey using 20 questions in an electronic format. The target population was identified through Leicester Asian Doctors Society and Leicester Asian Nurses Society. The questionnaire was then distributed electronically to the members. Survey questionnaire was accessed by 372, incomplete response (172) were excluded and 200 completed responses were analysed. RESULTS: Majority of BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line duties. More than 70% were anxious about their role during this pandemic. The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply was adequate, and the support received from the local healthcare providers was more than satisfactory. The work force perceived co-morbidity, lack of PPE and testing were one of the few reasons for increased death in BAME. BAME group felt adequate provision of PPE, increased testing and improving mental health well-being is required to alleviate concerns and improve BAME working life in NHS. CONCLUSION: BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line work and current anxiety level is very high. Adequate provision of mental health support with clear risk stratification for return to work is required urgently.","Moorthy, Arumugam; Sankar, Thangasamy K",J Public Health (Oxf),,333
374691,"Letter to the Editor ""Incorporating Telehealth to Improve Neurosurgical Training During the COVID-19 Pandemic""",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 containment measures and the uncertainties associated with the pandemic may have contributed to changes in mental health risks and mental health problems in university students. Due to the high burden of the disease, depression is of particular concern. However, knowledge about the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Swiss university students during the pandemic is limited. We therefore assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their change during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Swiss university students. METHODS: We assessed depressive symptoms in two cross-sectional cohorts of university students (n = 3571) in spring and autumn 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared them with a matched sample of the Swiss national population (n = 2328). Binary logistic regression models estimated prevalence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Adjusted prevalence of depressive symptoms in female (30.8% (95% CI: 28.6-33.0)) and male students (24.8% (95% CI: 21.7-28.1)) was substantially higher than in the matching female (10.9% (95% CI: 8.9-13.2)) and male (8.5% (6.6-11.0)) pre-pandemic national population. Depressive symptoms in the two consecutive student cohorts did not significantly differ. CONCLUSIONS: More than a quarter of Swiss university students reported depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was substantially higher as compared to the matched general population. Universities should introduce measures to support students in such times of crisis and gain an understanding of the factors impacting mental health positively or negatively and related to university structures and procedures.","Volken, Thomas; Zysset, Annina; Amendola, Simone; Klein Swormink, Anthony; Huber, Marion; von Wyl, Agnes; Dratva, Julia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,333
375196,A targeted response to the COVID-19 pandemic: analysing effectiveness of remote consultations for triage and management of routine dermatology referrals,2020,"Recently, the whole world has faced the deadliest and dangerous consequences due to the transmission of infectious novel coronavirus (nCov). With the outbreak of COVID-19, the education learners, practitioners, and other stakeholders were at the sake of a loss, as it causes the suspension of physical classes and physical interaction of the learners. In these circumstances, Electronic learning (E-learning), Online learning, and the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools came in handy. It helped the learners in the dissemination of ideas, conducting online classes, making online discussion forums, and taking online examinations. Like the government of each country, the Indian government was also caught off-guard but the existing E-learning infrastructure was able to leverage on while devising plans to tailor them to new situations and launching new ones. The initiatives at the forefront of this noble battle launched by the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) includes Diksha, Swayam Prabha Channel, Shiksha Van, E-Pathshala, and National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER). It worth noting that apart from the Indian central government efforts, each state has various online education initiatives that are tailored to their needs. This research evaluated each of these initiatives commenced by central and state governments and present a detailed analysis of most of the relevant initiatives. Additionally, a survey is conducted to get insights of learners in concern to online learning. Despite the issues raised in this learning, the outcomes come to be satisfactorily favoring online learning.","Singh, Madanjit; Adebayo, Sulaimon Oyeniyi; Saini, Munish; Singh, Jaswinder",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,333

This study compares the use of two antibody assays among large cohorts of healthcare workers in southern England. METHODS: This cohort study includes data obtained from staff at Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (WSHT) and Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals (BSUH) during voluntary antibody testing, using Abbott and Roche SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays at each Trust respectively. RESULTS: The observed seroprevalence level was 7.9% for the WSHT/Abbott cohort versus 13% for the BSUH/Roche cohort. Based on a previous positive PCR, we find that the false-negative rate of the Abbott and Roche assays were 60.2% and 19% respectively, implying sensitivity levels of 39.8% and 81%. Within these cohorts, seropositivity was most strongly associated with those of South Asian ethnicity, allied health professionals and male sex (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world study, neither antibody test performed to the specification level stated by the manufacturer.

377802,Critical Considerations for Reopening Scheduled Surgical Care in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Framework for Implementation,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) as the Singapore government escalated containment efforts from DORSCON Orange to Circuit Breaker. NPI include mandatory mask wearing, hand hygiene, social distancing, and closure of schools and workplaces. Considering the similar mode of transmission of COVID-19 and other pathogens related to acute respiratory infections (ARI), the effects of NPI could possibly lead to decreased ARI attendances in the community. This study aims to determine the year-on-year and weekly changes of ARI attendances across a cluster of polyclinics following the implementation of NPI. METHODS: The effect of the nation-wide measures on the health-seeking behaviour of the study population was examined over three periods: (1) 9 weeks prior to the start of Circuit Breaker (DORSCON Orange period), (2) 8 weeks during the Circuit Breaker, and (3) 9 weeks after easing of Circuit Breaker. Data on ARI attendances for the corresponding periods in 2019 were also extracted for comparison and to assess the seasonal variations of ARI. The average weekly workday ARI attendances were compared with those of the preceding week using Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: ARI attendances dropped steadily throughout the study period and were 50-80% lower than in 2019 since Circuit Breaker. They remained low even after Circuit Breaker ended. Positivity rate for influenza-like illnesses samples in the community was 0.0% from the last week of Circuit Breaker to end of study period. CONCLUSIONS: NPI and public education measures during DORSCON Orange and Circuit Breaker periods appear to be associated with the health-seeking behaviour of the public. Changing levels of perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits and barriers, and widespread visual cues based on the Health Belief Model may account for this change. Understanding the impact of NPI and shifts in the public's health-seeking behaviour will be relevant and helpful in the planning of future pandemic responses.","Tan, Hwee Mian Jane; Tan, Mui Suan; Chang, Zi Ying; Tan, Kee Tung; Ee, Guan Liang Adrian; Ng, Chee Chin David; Hwang, Ying Khee William; Koh, Yi Ling Eileen; Low, Yan Ping Sarah; Tan, Ngiap Chuan",BMC Public Health,,333

380141,Complex Care Has Arrived,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan. The virus is highly infectious. Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients. And the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is challenged by the immunosuppressive state of these patients under chemotherapy or surgery.","Song, Shi-Hui; Chen, Tie-Long; Deng, Li-Ping; Zhang, Yong-Xi; Mo, Ping-Zheng; Gao, Shi-Cheng; Hu, Wen-Jia; Xiong, Yong; Ma, Zhi-Yong",Infect Dis Poverty,,333

381219,Letter to the Editor: Covid-19 and the Challenges of Frailty Screening in Older Adults,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction that has not been previously described in patients with ARDS due to other causes. The purpose of this report is to describe a case series of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS in which ETT occlusion resulted in significant clinical consequences and to define the pathology of the obstructing material. METHODS: Incidents of ETT occlusion during mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients were reported by clinicians and retrospective chart review was conducted. Statistical analysis was performed comparing event rates between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients on mechanical ventilation over the predefined period. Specimens were collected and submitted for pathological examination. FINDINGS: Eleven COVID-19 patients experienced endotracheal tube occlusion over a period of 2 months. Average age was 69 (14.3, range 33-85) years. Mean APACHE III score was 73.6 (17.3). All patients had AKI and cytokine storm. Nine exhibited biomarkers for hypercoagulability. Average days on mechanical ventilation before intervention for ETT occlusion was 14 (5.18) days (range of 9 to 23 days). Five patients were discharged from the ICU, and 4 expired. Average documented airway resistance on admission was 14.2 (3.0) cm H2O/L/sec. Airway resistance before tube exchange was 28.1 (8.0) cm H2O /L/sec. No similar events of endotracheal tube occlusion were identified in non-COVID patients on mechanical ventilation during the same time period. Microscopically, the material consisted of mucin admixed with necrotic cell debris, variable numbers of degenerated inflammatory cells, oral contaminants and red blood cells. INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19 and ARDS on prolonged mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing ETT obstruction due to deposition of a thick, tenacious material within the tube that consists primarily of mucin and cellular debris. Clinicians should be aware of this dangerous but treatable complication.","Wiles, Samuel; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Neuhofs, Scott; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Reynolds, Jordan P; Hatipoglu, Umur",J Intensive Care Med,,333
381220,Letter to the Editor: Covid-19 and the Challenges of Frailty Screening in Older Adults,2020,"In seasonally breeding vertebrates, hormones coordinate changes in nervous system structure and function to facilitate reproductive readiness and success. Steroid hormones often exert their effects indirectly via regulation of neuromodulators, which in turn can coordinate the modulation of sensory input with appropriate motor output. Female plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) undergo increased peripheral auditory sensitivity in time for the summer breeding season, improving their ability to detect mates, which is regulated by steroid hormones. Reproductive females also show differences in catecholaminergic innervation of auditory circuitry compared to winter, non-reproductive females as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholaminergic synthesis. Importantly, catecholaminergic input to the inner ear from a dopaminergic-specific forebrain nucleus is decreased in the summer and dopamine inhibits the sensitivity of the inner ear, suggesting that gonadal steroids may alter auditory sensitivity by regulating dopamine innervation. In this study, we gonadectomized non-reproductive females, implanted them with estradiol (E2) or testosterone (T), and measured TH immunoreactive (-ir) fibers in auditory nuclei where catecholaminergic innervation was previously shown to be seasonally plastic. We found that treatment with T, but not E2, reduced TH-ir innervation in the auditory hindbrain. T-treatment also reduced TH-ir fiber density in the forebrain dopaminergic cell group that projects to the inner ear, and likely to the auditory hindbrain. Higher T plasma in the treatment group was correlated with reduced-ir TH terminals in the inner ear. These T-treatment induced changes in TH-ir fibers mimic the seasonal downregulation of dopamine in the midshipman inner ear and provide evidence that steroid hormone regulation of peripheral auditory sensitivity is mediated by dopamine.","Perelmuter, Jonathan T; Hom, Kelsey N; Mohr, Rob A; Demis, Lina; Kim, Spencer; Chernenko, Alena; Timothy, Miky; Middleton, Mollie A; Sisneros, Joseph A; Forlano, Paul M",Integr. comp. biol,,333

381788,Pivoting Dental Practice Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Systematic Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Increased anxiety was frequently reported during the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic. An association between anxiety and increased body weight has been documented. Identifying associations between diet quality and anxiety may facilitate the development of preventive dietary policy, particularly relevant since obesity appears to increase the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. In this study we aim to examine associations between changes in diet pattern and body weight and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic among Israeli respondents to an international online survey. METHODS: Conducted between March 30-April 252,020, this was cross-sectional, international and online study. The questionnaire was developed and tested in Hebrew and translated into six other languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian, and Russian. The survey was conducted on a Google Survey platform, the link to which was posted on several social media platforms. Adults aged 18 or older who saw and responded to the link on a social media site comprised the study population. RESULTS: Of the 3979 eligible respondents, 1895 indicated their current location as Israel. Most Israeli respondents completed the survey in Hebrew (83.2%) followed by Arabic (9.4%), though responses were recorded in all seven of the survey languages. The median age was 33 (IQ = 22) years, and 75.7% were female. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet, and 25.2% indicated they had gained weight during the pandemic. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQ = 3). While the median General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score was 5 (IQ = 8), only 37.3% of participants reported at least mild anxiety (a GAD-7 score of 5 or more), while 10.7% reported moderate anxiety or greater (a GAD-7 score of 10 or more). In a multivariate logistic regression model of at least mild anxiety, being male and completing the survey in Hebrew significantly reduced odds of at least mild anxiety, while a worsening of diet quality during the pandemic, weight gain, and isolation significantly increased odds of at least mild anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID pandemic, changes in nutrition quality and habits were associated with greater anxiety. These findings suggest the need for routine and continuous surveillance of the nutritional and psychological consequences of outbreaks as part of healthcare preparedness efforts. Organizations responsible for community-based health services (such as Israeli health plans) should adopt specific interventions to improve case finding and support individuals at increased risk of anxiety and declining nutrition status within primary healthcare settings. These interventions should include the provision of appropriate diagnostic instruments, training of medical staff, feedback to physicians and nurses, and raising awareness among the relevant patient population and their caregivers. Primary care physicians should refer people with high anxiety or substantial weight gain during the pandemic to appropriate mental health and dietetic treatment, as needed.

We consider how fear of infection and economic distress affected citizens' trust and confidence in President Mutharika's government, their willingness to turn out to vote, and their choices at the polls using data collected pre- and post-Covid. We find that fears about the virus and its economic impact did influence trust and confidence in the government to handle Covid but had little to no effect on either abstention or vote choice.

OBJECTIVE: This genus is responsible for many local and systemic conditions in both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, but its beneficial or deleterious role in the microbiota has been little explored. DESIGN: Online databases were used to identify papers published from 1999 to 2019 based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to study comparative trials. Work using other identification methods, case reports, reviews, and non-comparative clinical trials was excluded. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We selected 42 papers from among 668 publications. They showed a link between the abundance of Capnocytophaga spp. in the oral microbiota and various local pathologies (higher for gingivitis and halitosis; lower in active smokers, etc.) or systemic diseases (higher for cancer and carcinomas, IgA nephropathy, etc.). After discussing the limits inherent to the NGS techniques, we present several technical and biological hypotheses to explain the diversity of results observed between studies, as well as the links between the higher or lower abundance of Capnocytophaga spp and the appearance of local or systemic conditions and diseases.","Jolivet-Gougeon, Anne; Bonnaure-Mallet, Martine",Oral dis,,333

390181,The relationship between smoking and COVID-19 progression,2020,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has caused a large global pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide association studies have identified potential genetic variants involved in the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unclear. METHODS: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19. RESULTS: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (ß [SE]=0.42 [0.09], Pâ¯=â¯4.75â¯×â¯10-06 and ß [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], Pâ¯=â¯6.76â¯×â¯10-06, respectively). Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2 and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: We identified IFNAR2 and other potential genes that could be involved in the susceptibility or prognosis of COVID-19. These findings provide important leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cytokine storm and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of COVID-19.","Liu, Di; Yang, Jingyun; Feng, Bowen; Lu, Wenjin; Zhao, Chuntao; Li, Lizhuo",J. infect,,333

393121,Quarantine experience of close contacts of COVID-19 patients in China: A qualitative descriptive study,2020,"Nowadays, an infectious disease outbreak is considered one of the most destructive effects in the sustainable development process. The outbreak of new coronavirus (COVID-19) as an infectious disease showed that it has undesirable social, environmental, and economic impacts, and leads to serious challenges and threats. Additionally, investigating the prioritization parameters is of vital importance to reducing the negative impacts of this global crisis. Hence, the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters. For this purpose, four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters-such as daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed-and an urban parameter, population density, were considered as input data set, with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset. In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters. The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one. Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE. In addition, the priority of two variables, urban parameter, and relative humidity, were the highest to predict the confirmed cases of COVID-19.","Shaffiee Haghshenas, Sina; Pirouz, Behrouz; Shaffiee Haghshenas, Sami; Pirouz, Behzad; Piro, Patrizia; Na, Kyoung-Sae; Cho, Seo-Eun; Geem, Zong Woo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,333

393336,Authors' response: Excess all-cause mortality during second wave of COVID-19 - the Polish perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections at the primary care level represents the major source of antibiotic misuse in healthcare, and is a major driver for antimicrobial resistance worldwide. In this study we will develop, pilot and evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive antibiotic stewardship programme in China's primary care hospitals to reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections among all ages. METHODS: We will use a parallel-group, cluster-randomised, controlled, superiority trial with blinded outcome evaluation but unblinded treatment (providers and patients). We will randomise 34 primary care hospitals from two counties within Guangdong province into the intervention and control arm (1:1 overall ratio) stratified by county (8:9 within-county ratio). In the control arm, antibiotic prescribing and management will continue through usual care. In the intervention arm, we will implement an antibiotic stewardship programme targeting family physicians and patients/caregivers. The family physician components include: (1) training using new operational guidelines, (2) improved management and peer-review of antibiotic prescribing, (3) improved electronic medical records and smart phone app facilitation. The patient/caregiver component involves patient education via family physicians, leaflets and videos. The primary outcome is the proportion of prescriptions for acute respiratory infections (excluding pneumonia) that contain any antibiotic(s). Secondary outcomes will address how frequently specific classes of antibiotics are prescribed, how frequently key non-antibiotic alternatives are prescribed and the costs of consultations. We will conduct a qualitative process evaluation to explore operational questions regarding acceptability, cultural appropriateness and burden of technology use, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis and a long-term benefit evaluation. The duration of the intervention will be 12 months, with another 24 months' post-trial long-term follow-up. DISCUSSION: Our study is one of the first trials to evaluate the effect of an antibiotic stewardship programme in primary care settings in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC). All interventional activities will be designed to be embedded into routine primary care with strong local ownership. Through the trial we intend to impact on clinical practice and national policy in antibiotic prescription for primary care facilities in rural China and other LMICs.

Prior studies have focused mainly on clinical risk factors associated with serious illness and mortality of COVID-19. Less analysis has been conducted on the clinical, sociodemographic, and environmental variables associated with initial infection of COVID-19. METHODS: A multivariable statistical model was used to characterize risk factors in 34,503cases of laboratory-confirmed positive or negative COVID-19 infection in the Providence Health System (U.S.) between February 28 and April 27, 2020. Publicly available data were utilized as approximations for social determinants of health, and patient-level clinical and sociodemographic factors were extracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: Higher risk of COVID-19 infection was associated with older age (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.41-2.02, p < 0.0001), male gender (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.21-1.44, p < 0.0001), Asian race (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.18-1.72, p = 0.0002), Black/African American race (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.25-1.83, p < 0.0001), Latino ethnicity (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.77-2.41, p < 0.0001), non-English language (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.7-2.57, p < 0.0001), residing in a neighborhood with financial insecurity (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01-1.25, p = 0.04), low air quality (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.0-1.04, p = 0.05), housing insecurity (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.16-1.5, p < 0.0001) or transportation insecurity (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.02-1.23, p = 0.03), and living in senior living communities (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.23-2.32, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: sisk of COVID-19 infection is higher among groups already affected by health disparities across age, race, ethnicity, language, income, and living conditions. Health promotion and disease prevention strategies should prioritize groups most vulnerable to infection and address structural inequities that contribute to risk through social and economic policy.","Rozenfeld, Yelena; Beam, Jennifer; Maier, Haley; Haggerson, Whitney; Boudreau, Karen; Carlson, Jamie; Medows, Rhonda",Int J Equity Health,,333
394091,Community pharmacists and communication in the time of COVID-19: Applying the health belief model,2020,"The objective is to investigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated neurological and psychiatric effects and explore possible pathogenic mechanisms. This study included 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Neurological manifestations were evaluated by well-trained neurologists, psychologists, psychiatric presentations and biochemical changes were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and electronic medical records. Eighteen (23.4%) patients presented with neurological symptoms. Patients with neurological presentations had higher urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and lower basophil counts. Among them, patients with muscle involvement had higher urea nitrogen and cystatin C levels but lower basophil counts. In addition, patients with psychiatric presentations were older and had higher interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels and higher alkaline phosphatase, R-glutamate transferase, and urea nitrogen levels. Moreover, patients with anxiety had higher IL-6 and IL-10 levels than those without, and patients with moderate depression had higher CD8 + T cell counts and lower CD4 + /CD8 + ratios than other patients. This study indicates that the central nervous system may be influenced in patients with COVID-19, and the pathological mechanisms may be related to direct virus invasion of the central nervous system, infection-mediated overreaction of the immune system, and aberrant serum pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, basophils and cystatin C may also play important roles during these pathological processes. Our findings suggest that neurological and psychiatric presentations should be evaluated and managed in patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","He, Xudong; Zhang, Dan; Zhang, Lei; Zheng, Xu; Zhang, Ge; Pan, Konghan; Yu, Hong; Zhang, Lisan; Hu, Xingyue",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,,333

This analysis provides insight into the possible implications of the policy actions taken in the region. Methods: An in-depth review and analysis of available data from the DACH countries was conducted. Data was collected from official government sources whenever possible, and supplemented by information from international databases and local reports. The data was then analyzed to identify common patterns as well as significant divergences across the DACH region, especially in the area of health policy and technology use. Results: The DACH countries faced similar epidemiological situations during the Covid-19 pandemic, and were largely successful at preventing many of the negative impacts seen across the rest of Europe. Although many differences in health systems and governance structures existed, the policy responses in all three countries managed to address some of the most important factors in containing an infectious disease outbreak of this magnitude. Conclusions: The actions taken by all three DACH countries appear to have been largely successful in reducing the health impact of Covid-19, allowing a return to normal economic activities much earlier than in neighboring countries. However, the implications of certain policies related to economic resilience and health system capacity cannot yet be fully evaluated and may even prove to have negative impacts into the future.","Desson, Zachary; Lambertz, Lisa; Peters, Jan Willem; Falkenbach, Michelle; Kauer, Lukas",Health Policy Technol.,,333

398395,Neonatal and Pediatric Emergency Room Visits in a Tertiary Center during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread around the world, causing the disease COVID-19. To contain the virus, much hope is placed on participatory surveillance using mobile apps, such as automated digital contact tracing, but broad adoption is an important prerequisite for associated interventions to be effective. Data protection aspects are a critical factor for adoption, and privacy risks of solutions developed often need to be balanced against their functionalities. This is reflected by an intensive discussion in the public and the scientific community about privacy-preserving approaches. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to inform the current discussions and to support the development of solutions providing an optimal balance between privacy protection and pandemic control. To this end, we present a systematic analysis of existing literature on citizen-centered surveillance solutions collecting individual-level spatial data. Our main hypothesis is that there are dependencies between the following dimensions: the use cases supported, the technology used to collect spatial data, the specific diseases focused on, and data protection measures implemented. METHODS: We searched PubMed and IEEE Xplore with a search string combining terms from the area of infectious disease management with terms describing spatial surveillance technologies to identify studies published between 2010 and 2020. After a two-step eligibility assessment process, 27 articles were selected for the final analysis. We collected data on the four dimensions described as well as metadata, which we then analyzed by calculating univariate and bivariate frequency distributions. RESULTS: We identified four different use cases, which focused on individual surveillance and public health (most common: digital contact tracing). We found that the solutions described were highly specialized, with 89% (24/27) of the articles covering one use case only. Moreover, we identified eight different technologies used for collecting spatial data (most common: GPS receivers) and five different diseases covered (most common: COVID-19). Finally, we also identified six different data protection measures (most common: pseudonymization). As hypothesized, we identified relationships between the dimensions. We found that for highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 the most common use case was contact tracing, typically based on Bluetooth technology. For managing vector-borne diseases, use cases require absolute positions, which are typically measured using GPS. Absolute spatial locations are also important for further use cases relevant to the management of other infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We see a large potential for future solutions supporting multiple use cases by combining different technologies (eg, Bluetooth and GPS). For this to be successful, however, adequate privacy-protection measures must be implemented. Technologies currently used in this context can probably not offer enough protection. We, therefore, recommend that future solutions should consider the use of modern privacy-enhancing techniques (eg, from the area of secure multiparty computing and differential privacy).","Wirth, Felix Nikolaus; Johns, Marco; Meurers, Thierry; Prasser, Fabian",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,333

To manage these intubated patients there are need of more ventilators but world is not prepared for this type of situation and there are lacunae of such arrangements in most of the countries. As we know patients cannot be intubated for long time and they should be given preference to alternative airway in the form of tracheostomy. COVID-19 is aerosol transmitted disease which lead to indeed challenge to health care providers to safely perform tracheostomy and provide post tracheostomy care to these patients with minimising risks of nosocomial transmission to themselves and accompanying nursing staff. There are so many guidelines and recommendations for the timing, desired place of tracheostomy, change in tracheostomy steps related to conventional method and the subsequent management of patients. So, the aim of this systematic review is to give a brief review of available data on COVID-19 related to the timing, personal protections, operative steps modifications, and subsequent post tracheostomy care during this pandemic.","Shah, Rahulkumar; Priyadarshini, G; Parsana, Monil",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,333

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as a predictor of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality. METHODS: A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted. Forty adult patients (50% men) with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the ICU were enrolled. The primary endpoint was mortality at day 60. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured on the day of admission to the ICU. We used the Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess serum 25(OH)D concentration as a predictor of COVID-19 mortality. RESULTS: All 40 patients had a low median (IQR) serum 25(OH)D concentration at admission [12 (9-15) ng/mL]. The median (IQR) serum 25(OH)D concentration was greater in survivors [13.3 (10.0-17.1) ng/mL, n = 22] than in nonsurvivors [9.6 (7.9-14.2) ng/mL; n = 18], P = 0.044. The area under the ROC curve was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.86; P = 0.044). The 60-d mortality rate of those with serum 25(OH)D concentrations &#8804;9.9 ng/mL (n = 14, 71%) tended to be greater than that of those with concentrations >9.9 ng/mL (n = 26, 31%) (P = 0.065), and they had a 5.6-fold higher risk of death (OR: 5.63; 95% CI: 1.35, 23.45; P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The ICU patients had a low serum 25(OH)D concentration. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations &#8804;9.9 ng/mL on admission can be used to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04450017.","Bychinin, Mikhail V; Klypa, Tatiana V; Mandel, Irina A; Andreichenko, Sergey A; Baklaushev, Vladimir P; Yusubalieva, Gaukhar M; Kolyshkina, Nadezhda A; Troitsky, Aleksandr V",J. nutr,,333

From March to April 2020, the Laboratory of Advanced Cellular Therapies (Vicenza, Italy) received requests to treat a patient with severe COVID-19 and a patient with acute graft-versus-host disease with umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs). Access to clinics was restricted due to the risk of contagion. Transport of UC-MSCs in liquid nitrogen was unmanageable, leaving shipment in dry ice as the only option. METHODS: We assessed effects of the transition from liquid nitrogen to dry ice on cell viability; apoptosis; phenotype; proliferation; immunomodulation; and clonogenesis; and validated dry ice-based transport of UC-MSCs to clinics. RESULTS: Our results showed no differences in cell functionality related to the two storage conditions, and demonstrated the preservation of immunomodulatory and clonogenic potentials in dry ice. UC-MSCs were successfully delivered to points-of-care, enabling favourable clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This experience underscores the flexibility of a public cell factory in its adaptation of the logistics of an advanced therapy medicinal product during a public health crisis. Alternative supply chains should be evaluated for other cell products to guarantee delivery during catastrophes.","Astori, Giuseppe; Bernardi, Martina; Bozza, Angela; Catanzaro, Daniela; Chieregato, Katia; Merlo, Anna; Santimaria, Monica; Barbazza, Roberto; Amodeo, Giuseppe; Ciccocioppo, Rachele; Elice, Francesca; Ruggeri, Marco",J Transl Med,,333

Through an interdisciplinary network of experts, a new mask design was developed and tested that uses repurposed air filtration media and commercially available components. Manufacturing viability was tested using a small unskilled workforce (n=10-20) to create 6000 masks over 10 days.

415820,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic expanding in sub-Saharan Africa: Considerations for COVID-19 in people living with HIV,2020,"The social dimension of innovation is growing due to unprecedented wicked global challenges we all face, including COVID-19 pandemic. Those challenges in their dynamic complexity require new cross-scale, cross-domain and action-oriented approaches at the universities. I argue that universities need to go beyond their traditional missions and to take an active role in a transformative change by working with their communities and creating real social impact. The fourth mission concept is particularly relevant as it puts emphasis on the universities roles in sustainable development. I propose to reflect on those new roles of universities in the context of quadruple/quintuple helix model that is seen as playing an important role in fostering the shift from technical to social innovations. Social innovation is an element of a regional innovation system, in which the importance of knowledge is not determined exclusively by competitiveness and productivity, but by taking into account the creation of social well-being, the impact on the quality of life and co-creation of knowledge as part of public–private partnerships. By addressing social innovation practices from a perspective of Polish public universities, it fills the gap of relatively few studies on institutional change and incentive structures that influences the ability of universities to engage in social innovation by proposing. I propose to adapt the socially engaged university model that could be a tool for stimulating and strengthening their functions within a modern regional innovation system allowing for an active role of civil society organisations.","Morawska-Jancelewicz, Joanna",Journal of the Knowledge Economy,,333

The reports originate from national laws, according to which positive test findings must be submitted to the Federal Health Authorities, the Robert Koch Institute, via the local health authorities. Since an enormous number of unreported cases can be expected, the question of how widespread the disease has been in the population cannot be answered based on these administrative reports. Using mathematical modeling, however, estimates can be made. These estimates indicate that the small numbers of diagnostic tests carried out at the beginning of the outbreak overlooked considerable parts of the infection. In order to cover the initial phase of future waves of the disease, wide-spread and comprehensive tests are recommended.","Brinks, Ralph; Hoyer, Annika",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03408v1.pdf,333

Whereas the infection mortality rate is not completely understood, it seems to be significantly beyond that of other recent pandemics (e.g., H1N1 pandemic). This paper discusses moral injury in the context of disaster and epidemic and how easily the moral psychology of individuals and society can be shaken. Moral injury is a multiscientific concept involving psychology, culture, and religion. Amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, immoral behaviors and events such as violence, injury, and illness have also caused different degrees of impact on the moral standards of individuals, confusing moral cognition, destroying moral emotion, and weakening moral toughness, resulting in varying degrees of moral injury. If there is no national health, there will be no positive society for all. Based on this, the public needs to pay close attention to the moral health of the whole people and effectively avoid the occurrence of moral injury.

METHODS: This retrospective case-control study was aimed at identifying the possible genes involved in implant failure in Down syndrome patients by matching the periodontal disease variable by means of a retrospective case-control study. This process involved using the functional analysis of gene expression software Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC, Affymetrix, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and a search for the possible candidate genes involved. Focus was placed on the 92 genes related to the inflammation identified from the TaqMan&#8482; Array Plate Human Inflammation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Surveys explored the frequency and duration of engaging in binge watching, serial viewing, and appointment viewing, as well as the role of habit in binge watching and the technologies employed to view content. Findings/Results Frequency of binge watching and serial viewing increased from 2015 to 2020, and levels remain elevated from estimates just prior to COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, which saw all types of viewing increase. Participants report most frequently engaging in serial viewing, followed binge watching, followed by appointment viewing. Appointment viewing frequency and duration has decreased. A binge-watching habit explains considerable variance in the frequency of binge watching. Conclusions Binge watching has become a more common way to watch TV than traditional appointment viewing, which has decreased in both the frequency and time spent between 2015 and 2020. Serial viewing – a self-paced consumption of serialized narrative content over days, weeks, or months – is the most common way of watching television content. Serial viewing and binge watching are more closely associated with viewing content on television, demonstrating a shift from the personal screen to the living room.","Rubenking, Bridget Campanella Bracken Cheryl",Addictive Behaviors Reports,,333
425443,Covid-19 pandemic preparedness and mitigation plan: Department of internal medicine experience from a clinical perspective,2021,"Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced oncology clinicians and administrators in the United States to set priorities for cancer care owing to resource constraints. As oncology practices adapt to a contracted health care system, expertise gained from partnerships in low-resource settings can be used for guidance. This article provides a primer on priority setting in oncology and ethical guidance based on lessons learned from experience with cancer care priority setting in low-resource settings. Observations: Lessons learned from real-world experiences are myriad. First, in the setting of limited resources, a utilitarian approach to maximizing survival benefit should guide decision-making. Second, conflicting principles will often arise among stakeholders and decision makers. Third, fair decision-making procedures should be established to ensure moral legitimacy and accountability. Fourth, proactive safeguards must be implemented to protect vulnerable individuals, or disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes will only widen further. Fifth, communication with patients and families about priority setting decisions should be intentional and standardized. Sixth, moral distress among clinicians must be addressed to avoid burnout during a time when resilience is critical. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the need to triage cancer care may be new to those who underwent training and now practice oncology in high-resource settings, it is familiar for those who practice in low- and middle-income countries. Oncologists in the United States facing unprecedented decisions about prioritization can draw on ethical frameworks and lessons learned from real-world cancer care priority setting in resource-constrained environments.","DeBoer, Rebecca J; Fadelu, Temidayo A; Shulman, Lawrence N; Van Loon, Katherine",JAMA Oncol,,333

The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of vaccination coverage and intention to vaccinate among college students. College students (N = 457) enrolled in the Spring 2021 semester at a university in New Jersey completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, COVID-19 and vaccination history, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 vaccine information, and vaccine attitudes. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with vaccination, and the intention to vaccinate among non-vaccinated students. Results indicate that 23% (n = 105) of participants reported being vaccinated already. Among non-vaccinated students, 52.8% indicated their intention to receive the vaccine when it is made available to college students. Students who were health care workers (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 4.17, p < 0.001), had a family member who had received a COVID-19 vaccine (aOR = 5.03, p < 0.001), exhibited greater positive attitudes regarding vaccination (aOR = 1.12, p < 0.001), and received a seasonal flu vaccine (aOR = 1.97, p < 0.05) were more likely to have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Among non-vaccinated students, those who discussed COVID-19 vaccine information with others (aOR = 5.38, p < 0.001), and exhibited more overall positive attitudes regarding vaccination (aOR = 2.69, p < 0.001), were more likely to indicate their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Findings of this study highlight the need for additional education and vaccine outreach aimed at promoting uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among college students.","Kecojevic, Aleksandar; Basch, Corey H; Sullivan, Marianne; Chen, Yen-Tyng; Davi, Nicole K",J. community health,,333
428417,A Systematic Review of Primary and Secondary Callous-Unemotional Traits and Psychopathy Variants in Youth,2020,"COVID-19 has now spread to all the continents of the world with the possible exception of Antarctica. However, Africa appears different when compared with all the other continents. The absence of exponential growth and the low mortality rates contrary to that experienced in other continents, and contrary to the projections for Africa by various agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) has been a puzzle to many. Although Africa is the second most populous continent with an estimated 17.2% of the world's population, the continent accounts for only 5% of the total cases and 3% of the mortality. Mortality for the whole of Africa remains at a reported 19,726 as at August 01, 2020. The onset of the pandemic was later, the rate of rise has been slower and the severity of illness and case fatality rates have been lower in comparison to other continents. In addition, contrary to what had been documented in other continents, the occurrence of the renal complications in these patients also appeared to be much lower. This report documents the striking differences between the continents and within the continent of Africa itself and then attempts to explain the reasons for these differences. It is hoped that information presented in this review will help policymakers in the fight to contain the pandemic, particularly within Africa with its resource-constrained health care systems.","Bamgboye, Ebun L; Omiye, Jesutofunmi A; Afolaranmi, Oluwasegun J; Davids, Mogamat Razeen; Tannor, Elliot Koranteng; Wadee, Shoyab; Niang, Abdou; Were, Anthony; Naicker, Saraladevi",J. natl. med. assoc,,333

429496,A scoping review of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on surgical practice,2020,"Background: In December, 2019, a novel zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus emerged in China. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became pandemic within weeks and the number of human infections and severe cases is increasing. We aimed to investigate the susceptibilty of potential animal hosts and the risk of anthropozoonotic spill-over infections. Methods: We intranasally inoculated nine fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), ferrets (Mustela putorius), pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), and 17 chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) with 105 TCID50 of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate per animal. Direct contact animals (n=3) were included 24 h after inoculation to test viral transmission. Animals were monitored for clinical signs and for virus shedding by nucleic acid extraction from nasal washes and rectal swabs (ferrets), oral swabs and pooled faeces samples (fruit bats), nasal and rectal swabs (pigs), or oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (chickens) on days 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 21 after infection by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). On days 4, 8, and 12, two inoculated animals (or three in the case of chickens) of each species were euthanised, and all remaining animals, including the contacts, were euthanised at day 21. All animals were subjected to autopsy and various tissues were collected for virus detection by RT-qPCR, histopathology immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies was tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralisation test in samples collected before inoculation and at autopsy. Findings: Pigs and chickens were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. All swabs, organ samples, and contact animals were negative for viral RNA, and none of the pigs or chickens seroconverted. Seven (78%) of nine fruit bats had a transient infection, with virus detectable by RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridisation in the nasal cavity, associated with rhinitis. Viral RNA was also identified in the trachea, lung, and lung-associated lymphatic tissue in two animals euthanised at day 4. One of three contact bats became infected. More efficient virus replication but no clinical signs were observed in ferrets, with transmission to all three direct contact animals. Mild rhinitis was associated with viral antigen detection in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. Prominent viral RNA loads of 0-104 viral genome copies per mL were detected in the upper respiratory tract of fruit bats and ferrets, and both species developed SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies reaching neutralising titres of up to 1/1024 after 21 days. Interpretation: Pigs and chickens could not be infected intranasally by SARS-CoV-2, whereas fruit bats showed characteristics of a reservoir host. Virus replication in ferrets resembled a subclinical human infection with efficient spread. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for further studies-eg, testing vaccines or antivirals.

Then we critically review recent SARS-CoV-2 studies to understand the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic through wastewater surveillance. SARS-CoV-2 genetic material has been detected in wastewater from France, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Japan, Spain, Turkey, India, Pakistan, China, and the USA. We then discuss the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to estimate the occurrence, distribution, and genetic diversity of these viruses and generate human health risk assessment. Finally, we not only promote the prevention of viral infectious disease transmission through wastewater but also highlight the potential use of WBE as an early warning system for public health assessment.","Ali, Waqar; Zhang, Hua; Wang, Zhenglu; Chang, Chuanyu; Javed, Asif; Ali, Kamran; Du, Wei; Niazi, Nabeel Khan; Mao, Kang; Yang, Zhugen",J Hazard Mater,,333

430238,Geriatric Skin Care in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"We performed this investigation to determine the effects on mortality of thrombolytic therapy in low-risk patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). This was a retrospective cohort study based on administrative data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2016 and 2017. Patients with a primary (first-listed) diagnosis of acute PE who were not in shock and not on a ventilator who did not have acute cor pulmonale were defined as low-risk. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification Codes. Mortality was assessed according to treatment with catheter-directed thrombolysis, intravenous thrombolytic therapy, or anticoagulants alone. Mortality with inferior vena cava (IVC) filters was also assessed. Mortality was lowest in low-risk patients treated with anticoagulants alone, 6,765 of 331,430 (2.0%). Mortality was somewhat higher with catheter-directed thrombolysis, 195 of 6915 (2.8%)(p<0.0001), and highest with intravenous thrombolysis 510 of 5,200 (9.8%)(p<0.0001). Matched patients showed similar results. Inferior vena cava filters did not reduce mortality in patients treated with anticoagulants alone. Mortality was only 0.5% higher in patients treated with anticoagulants who had saddle PE than in patients with non-saddle PE, 450 of 17,935 (2.5%) vs 6,315 of 313,495 (2.0%)(p<0.0001). However, a larger proportion of low-risk patients with saddle PE received catheter-directed thrombolysis than patients who had non-saddle PE, 2,330 of 21,760 (11%) vs 4,585 of 321,785 (1.4%)(p<0.0001). Similarly, a larger proportion of patients with saddle PE received intravenous thrombolytic therapy than patients with non-saddle PE, 1,495 of 21,760 (6.9%) vs 3,705 of 321,785 (1.2%)(p<0.0001). In conclusion, low-risk patients with PE did not have lower mortality with catheter-directed thrombolysis or intravenous thrombolytic therapy than with anticoagulants alone, and IVC filters did not reduce mortality with anticoagulants alone.","Stein, Paul D; Matta, Fadi; Hughes, Mary J",,,333

The coronavirus is naturally prevalent in mammals and birds. So far, six human-transmitted coronaviruses have been discovered. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Common symptoms include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, but in acute cases, the disease can lead to severe shortness of breath, hypoxia, and death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the three main transmission routes, such as droplet and contact routes, airborne transmission and fecal and oral for COVID-19, have been identified. So far, no definitive curative treatment has been discovered for COVID-19, and the available treatments are only to reduce the complications of the disease. According to the World Health Organization, preventive measures at the public health level such as quarantine of the infected person, identification and monitoring of contacts, disinfection of the environment, and personal protective equipment can significantly prevent the outbreak COVID-19. Currently, based on the urgent needs of the community to control this pandemic, the BNT162b2 (Pfizer), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), CoronaVac (Sinovac), Sputnik V (Gamaleya Research Institute, Acellena Contract Drug Research, and Development), BBIBP-CorV (Sinofarm), and AZD1222 (The University of Oxford;AstraZeneca) vaccines have received emergency vaccination licenses from health organizations in vaccine-producing countries.

We report here cryo-EM structures of a full-length S trimer carrying G614, which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations differing primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain (RBD). A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity. The loop transition may also modulate structural rearrangements of S protein required for membrane fusion.

METHODS: An FMEA was conducted by a team of medication safety pharmacists, oncology pharmacists and technicians, leadership from informatics, investigational drug, and medication safety services, and representatives from the technology vendor. Failure modes were scored using both Risk Priority Number (RPN) and Risk Hazard Index (RHI) scores. RESULTS: The chemotherapy preparation workflow was defined in a 41-step process with 16 failure modes. The RPN and RHI scores were identical for each failure mode because all failure modes were considered detectable. Five failure modes, all attributable to user error, were deemed to pose the highest risk. Mitigation strategies and system changes were identified for 2 failure modes, with subsequent system modifications resulting in reduced risk. CONCLUSION: The FMEA was a useful tool for risk mitigation and workflow optimization prior to implementation of an intravenous compounding technology. The process of conducting this study served as a collaborative and proactive approach to reducing the potential for medication errors upon adoption of new technology into the chemotherapy preparation process.","Feemster, Agnes Ann; Augustino, Melissa; Duncan, Rosemary; Khandoobhai, Anand; Rowcliffe, Meghan",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,333

Second, we find evidence of a segregation effect, since mobility contraction is stronger in municipalities in which inequality is higher and for those where individuals have lower income per capita. Our results highlight both the social costs of lockdown and a challenge of unprecedented intensity: On the one hand, the crisis is inducing a sharp reduction of fiscal revenues for both national and local governments; on the other hand, a significant fiscal effort is needed to sustain the most fragile individuals and to mitigate the increase in poverty and inequality induced by the lockdown.","Bonaccorsi, Giovanni; Pierri, Francesco; Cinelli, Matteo; Flori, Andrea; Galeazzi, Alessandro; Porcelli, Francesco; Schmidt, Ana Lucia; Valensise, Carlo Michele; Scala, Antonio; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Pammolli, Fabio",Proc.

This rapid scoping review of these guidelines was done to assess the quality of their evidence and appraise them for their impact on surgical services from the global south. A simple quality appraisal tool was constructed which can be used to evaluate rapidly emerging guidelines for evidence as well as for the needs of the global south. This rapid scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews protocol. Electronic databases were searched with predefined strategy and retrieved papers were screened according to relevant criteria. A simple objective tool to assess the quality of rapidly emerging guidelines including evidence, methodology, ease, resource optimization, geography, and the economy was constructed. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. None of the guidelines qualified to be evidence-based clinical practice guidelines as the level of evidence was uniformly rated ""low"". A newly constructed tool showed good validation, reliability, and internal consistency. This rapid scoping review found two major research gaps: lack of systematic review of evidence during their development and insufficient weightage of their impact on surgical services from the global south. These significant issues were addressed by constructing a simple and more representative tool for evaluating rapidly emerging guidelines which also gives the rightful importance of their impact on surgical services from the global south.","Yadav, Sanjay Kumar; Agrawal, Vikesh; Agarwal, Pawan; Sharma, Dhananjaya",Indian J Surg,,333

Histopathological findings typically include mesangial hypercellularity with IgM and complement deposition, though the spectrum may range from normal glomeruli through to focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Thromboembolism is a well recognised complication of nephrotic syndrome, but cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is rarely described. CASE PRESENTATION: This is the case of a 23-year-old male presenting with the nephrotic syndrome, whose initial renal biopsy was consistent with minimal change disease. Complete remission was achieved with prednisone, however multiple relapses and steroid dependence prompted re-biopsy, the results of which were more consistent with IgM nephropathy. His last relapse was complicated by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. He then received rituximab and a weaning course of prednisone to again enter remission. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need to consider IgM nephropathy in the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Additionally, it emphasises the risk of thrombosis in patients with severe nephrosis.","Downie, Elizabeth; Diep, Jason; Sungala, Nagendraprasad; Wong, Jeffrey",BMC Nephrol,,333

In this paper, a COVID-19 intelligent diagnosis model from chest CT image is proposed, which can identify the positive CT and locate the lesions. The model first uses the U2-Net network to segment the lung parenchyma from the CT image, then the segmented image is input into the COVID-19 screening network based on EfficientNet to predict the result of infection with COVID-19 and lesion areas. A new loss function is proposed to constrain the network to extract effective lesion features. Grad-CAM algorithm is finally used to visualize the lesions in CT images. The dataset is collected from 1170 patients in Union Hospital (HUST-UH) and Liyuan Hospital (HUST-LH). The experimental results show that the dice coefficient of the segmentation network reaches 0.9838, the sensitivity of the COVID-19 screening network reaches 0.974, with an AUC of 0.994.

Inflammation might play a peculiar role in shifting towards a pro-thrombotic state. Anticoagulant drugs are the first cure line for VTE. The low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) show anti-coagulant capability as well as reducing levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-6. The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shown efficacy in threating VTE, additionally to the anti-activated factor X these drugs seem able to reduce the abnormal release of pro-inflammatory agents. The present study evaluated the capability of DOACs in reducing plasma level of IL-6 in patients suffered from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs. Our results showed reduced IL-6 expression levels in the peripheral lymphocytes of DVT compared to controls (fold-change, 2.8; P<0.05). We postulate that lowered IL-6 expression in the lymphocytes of DVT patients may mediate the anti-inflammatory action of DOACs. The present study is the first evidence concerning the anti-inflammatory properties of DOACs in specific setting of VTE patients such as DVT.","Candido, Saverio; Lumera, Giovanni; Barcellona, Giuliana; Vetri, Davide; Tumino, Elda; Platania, Ingrid; Frazzetto, Evelise; Privitera, Graziella; Incognito, Carmela; Gaudio, Agostino; Signorelli, Salvatore Santo",Exp Ther Med,,333

We report a case of a 48-year-old lady with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder who consumed a significant overdose of caffeine, triggered by the stress that she had contracted coronavirus disease 19. This led to significant cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. The condition was identified early and managed appropriately with early ß-blockers and gastric decontamination, which saved her life. There are few studies with regard to such modalities on treatment for caffeine overdose; our patient responded rapidly and favourably to the treatment.

446677,COVID-19 and palliative care,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been expanding globally since late 2019. SARS-CoV-2, an RNA virus, has a genome sequence that can easily undergo mutation. Several mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those with higher infectivity than others, have been reported. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is crucial to trace its infection sources. Here, we developed a simple, easy-to-use genotyping method to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants using a high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. METHODS: We investigated five mutation sites, A23403G, G25563T, G26144T, T28144C, and G28882A, which are known strain determinants according to GISAID clades (L, S, V, G, GH, and GR). RESULTS: We first employed synthetic DNA fragments containing the five characteristic sites for HRM analysis. All sequences clearly differentiated wild-type from mutant viruses. We then confirmed that RNA fragments were suitable for HRM analysis following reverse transcription. Human saliva did not negatively affect the HRM analysis, which supports the absence of a matrix effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that this HRM-based genotyping method can identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. This novel assay platform potentially paves the way for accurate and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection sources.","Aoki, Akira; Mori, Yoko; Okamoto, Yoshinori; Jinno, Hideto",J Infect Chemother,,333
447054,Optimizing care for atopic dermatitis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs. The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources.We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research.The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa.Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied.Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals.","White, Rebekah J; Razgour, Orly",Mammal review,,333

447736,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with chronic plaque psoriasis being treated with biological therapy: the Northern Italy experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: There has been much debate about the effectiveness of lockdown measures in containing COVID-19, and their appropriateness given the economic and social cost they entail. To the best of our knowledge, no existing contribution to the literature has attempted to gauge the effectiveness of lockdown measures over time in a longitudinal cross-country perspective. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing, at an international level, the effect of lockdown measures (or the lack of such measures) on the numbers of new infections. Given this policy's expected change in effectiveness over time, we also measure the effect of having a lockdown implemented over a given number of days (from 7 to 20 days). METHODS: We pursue our objectives by means of a quantitative panel analysis, building a longitudinal dataset with observations from countries all over the world, and estimating the impact of lockdown via feasible generalized least squares fixed effect, random effects, generalized estimating equation, and hierarchical linear models. RESULTS: Our results show that lockdown is effective in reducing the number of new cases in the countries that implement it, compared with those countries that do not. This is especially true around 10 days after the implementation of the policy. Its efficacy continues to grow up to 20 days after implementation. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that lockdown is effective in reducing the R0, i.e. the number of people infected by each infected person, and that, unlike what has been suggested in previous analyses, its efficacy continues to hold 20 days after the introduction of the policy.","Alfano, Vincenzo; Ercolano, Salvatore",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,,333

449059,The reduction in clinical and surgical exposure of trainees during COVID-19 and its impact on their training,2021,"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can affect the gene encoding the Spike (S) antigen, which interacts with the host cell specific receptor, selecting mutant variants with changes in their infective capacity, pathogenic potential and resistance to neutralizing antibodies. The nomenclature to design the variants uses a colloquial form referred to the country or place of detection, a code from the ""Pangolin"" database and one from the ""Nextstrain"" page. New variants that have spread include the British B.1.1.7 (20I/501Y.V1), the South African B.1.351 (20H/501.V2), the Brazilian P.1 (20J/501Y.V3), the Californians B.1.427 B.1.429 (20C/S:452R) and the most recent, the Indian B.1.617 (VUI-21APR-01). The gold standard for the identification of the variants is whole genome sequencing. However, real-time PCR techniques have already been developed for the detection of specific mutations that can facilitate their presumptive identification. The impact of these variants on global vaccination programs has raised concern. It is generally thought that, since the response evoked by the vaccine against the S antigen is directed at the entire protein and the mutations only affect specific regions, the escape effect of the vaccine antibodies will be limited. Among the future strategies proposed for immuno-protection, the increase in the number of doses, the alternation of vaccines and the development of specific vaccines against different variants has been suggested.","Pérez-Abeledo, Marta; Sanz, Juan Carlos",Vacunas (Madrid),,333

Methods: We developed a simple likelihood-based framework to estimate the instantaneous asymptomatic proportion of infectious diseases. Taking the COVID-19 epidemics in Hong Kong as a case study, we applied the estimation framework to estimate the reported asymptomatic proportion (rAP) using the publicly available surveillance data. We divided the time series of daily cases into four stages of epidemics in Hong Kong by examining the persistency of the epidemic and compared the rAPs of imported cases and local cases at different stages. Results: As of July 31, 2020, there were two intermittent epidemics in Hong Kong. The first one was dominated by imported cases, accounting for 63.2% of the total cases, and the second one was dominated by local cases, accounting for 86.5% of the total cases. The rAP was estimated at 23.1% (95% CI: 10.8-39.7%) from January 23 to July 31, and the rAPs were estimated at 22.6% (95% CI: 11.1-38.9%) among local cases and 38.7% (95% CI: 9.0-72.0%) among imported cases. Our results showed that the rAPs of local cases were not significantly different between the two epidemics, but increased gradually during the first epidemic period. In contrast, the rAPs of imported cases in the latter epidemic period were significantly higher than that in the previous epidemic period. Conclusion: Hong Kong has a high rAP of imported COVID-19 cases and should continue to strengthen the detection and isolation of imported individuals to prevent the resurgence of the disease.","Li, Chunyu; Zhao, Shi; Tang, Biao; Zhu, Yuchen; Ran, Jinjun; Li, Xiujun; He, Daihai",Front Public Health,,333

Methods: The clinical data of 164 COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were extracted and analysed retrospectively. Results: In total, 505 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups: those with gastrointestinal symptoms (G group) and those without gastrointestinal symptoms (NG group). Common gastrointestinal symptoms included inappetence, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Significantly higher proportions of patients with fever, dizziness, myalgia, and fatigue were noted in group G than in group NG. Compared with patients without fever, there was a significant difference between G group and NG group in moderate fever or above, while there was no significant difference between the two groups in low fever. The laboratory results showed that patients in the G group had significantly higher C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase levels than those in the NG group. Moreover, the proportion of patients with severe pneumonia was significantly higher in the G group than in the NG group. Conclusion: In Wuhan, the proportion of COVID-19 patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms is relatively high. Patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms are more likely to suffer from severe pneumonia, which may help clinicians identify patients at high risk of COVID-19 and thus reduce the incidence of this condition.","Zhang, Hu; Liao, Yu-Sheng; Gong, Jing; Liu, Jing; Xia, Xi; Zhang, Heng",Dig Liver Dis,,333
450496,COVID-19: Quarantine and human rights,2020,"Importance: Preventive interventions are needed to protect residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities from COVID-19 during outbreaks in their facilities. Bamlanivimab, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2, may confer rapid protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Objective: To determine the effect of bamlanivimab on the incidence of COVID-19 among residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, single-dose, phase 3 trial that enrolled residents and staff of 74 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in the United States with at least 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case. A total of 1175 participants enrolled in the study from August 2 to November 20, 2020. Database lock was triggered on January 13, 2021, when all participants reached study day 57. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of bamlanivimab, 4200 mg (n = 588), or placebo (n = 587). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was incidence of COVID-19, defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and mild or worse disease severity within 21 days of detection, within 8 weeks of randomization. Key secondary outcomes included incidence of moderate or worse COVID-19 severity and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The prevention population comprised a total of 966 participants (666 staff and 300 residents) who were negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 infection and serology (mean age, 53.0 [range, 18-104] years; 722 [74.7%] women). Bamlanivimab significantly reduced the incidence of COVID-19 in the prevention population compared with placebo (8.5% vs 15.2%; odds ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.28-0.68]; P < .001; absolute risk difference, -6.6 [95% CI, -10.7 to -2.6] percentage points). Five deaths attributed to COVID-19 were reported by day 57; all occurred in the placebo group. Among 1175 participants who received study product (safety population), the rate of participants with adverse events was 20.1% in the bamlanivimab group and 18.9% in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were urinary tract infection (reported by 12 participants [2%] who received bamlanivimab and 14 [2.4%] who received placebo) and hypertension (reported by 7 participants [1.2%] who received bamlanivimab and 10 [1.7%] who received placebo). Conclusions and Relevance: Among residents and staff in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, treatment during August-November 2020 with bamlanivimab monotherapy reduced the incidence of COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to assess preventive efficacy with current patterns of viral strains with combination monoclonal antibody therapy.

Drawing on a range of international examples this paper shows that this was utterly uninformed, that deregulation of finance in the US led to the worst financial crisis in 2008 since 1929 and that Thatcher's scrapping of the 1970s Labour governments' industrial policy instruments led to major de-industrialisation in the UK which influenced the 'No' vote in the 2016 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union. While the US nonetheless pursued an industrial policy by stealth which promoted a range of advanced technology corporations and that Germany, embodying liberal market principles after WW2, recently has endorsed the case for not only a German but also European industrial policy and led in advocating a European Green New Deal modelled on the Roosevelt New Deal which recovered the US from The Depression of the early 1930s and convinced Truman to support the Marshall Aid programme that also recovered Western Europe after the cataclysm of WW2.","Holland, Stuard",Symphonya,,333

The COVID-19 pandemic required researchers to consider if remote data collection can meet research objectives, while retaining the same level of data quality and participant protections. We use four case studies from the Philippines, Zambia, India and Uganda to assess the challenges and opportunities of remote data collection during COVID-19. We present lessons learned that may inform practice in similar settings, as well as reflections for the field of qualitative inquiry in the post-COVID-19 era. Key challenges and strategies to overcome them included the need for adapted researcher training in the use of technologies and consent procedures, preparation for abbreviated interviews due to connectivity concerns, and the adoption of regular researcher debriefings. Participant outreach to allay suspicions ranged from communicating study information through multiple channels to highlighting associations with local institutions to boost credibility. Interviews were largely successful, and contained a meaningful level of depth, nuance and conviction that allowed teams to meet study objectives. Rapport still benefitted from conventional interviewer skills, including attentiveness and fluency with interview guides. While differently abled populations may encounter different barriers, the included case studies, which varied in geography and aims, all experienced more rapid recruitment and robust enrollment. Reduced in-person travel lowered interview costs and increased participation among groups who may not have otherwise attended. In our view, remote data collection is not a replacement for in-person endeavours, but a highly beneficial complement. It may increase accessibility and equity in participant contributions and lower costs, while maintaining rich data collection in multiple study target populations and settings.","Reñosa, Mark Donald C; Mwamba, Chanda; Meghani, Ankita; West, Nora S; Hariyani, Shreya; Ddaaki, William; Sharma, Anjali; Beres, Laura K; McMahon, Shannon",,,333

455561,Willingness to Receive COVID-19 Vaccination Among People Living With HIV and AIDS in China: A Nationwide Online Survey (preprint),2021,"Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.","Libin, Pieter J K; Willem, Lander; Verstraeten, Timothy; Torneri, Andrea; Vanderlocht, Joris; Hens, Niel",PLoS Comput Biol,,333

Women experience unique health risks and outcomes influenced by their gender, and this narrative review aims to outline how these differences are exacerbated in the Covid-19 pandemic. OBSERVATIONS: It has been well described that men suffer from greater morbidity and mortality once infected with SARS-CoV-2. This review analyzed the health, economic, and social systems that result in gender-based differences in the areas healthcare workforce, reproductive health, drug development, gender-based violence, and mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. The increased risk of certain negative health outcomes and reduced healthcare access experienced by many women are typically exacerbated during pandemics. We assess data from previous disease outbreaks coupled with literature from the Covid-19 pandemic to examine the impact of gender on women's SARS-CoV-2 exposure and disease risks and overall health status during the Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in health risks and implications are likely to be expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic.

To characterize the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of BoCV isolates, we used 5 different BoCV strains to inoculate colostrum-deprived calves, ~ 2-5 wk of age. Later, to determine if dual viral infection would potentiate pathogenicity of BoCV, calves were inoculated with BoCV alone, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) alone, or a series of dual-infection (BVDV-BoCV) schemes. A negative control group was included in all studies. Clinical signs and body temperature were monitored during the study and samples collected for lymphocyte counts, virus isolation, and serology. During autopsy, gross lesions were recorded and fixed tissues collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry; fresh tissues were collected for virus isolation. Results suggest increased pathogenicity for isolate BoCV OK 1776. Increased body temperature was found in all virus-inoculated groups. Lung lesions were present in calves in all dual-infection groups; however, lesions were most pronounced in calves inoculated with BVDV followed by BoCV inoculation 6 d later. Lung lesions were consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of BoCV antigen. Our studies demonstrated that BVDV-BoCV dual infection may play an important role in BRD pathogenesis, and timing between infections seems critical to the severity of lesions.","Ridpath, Julia F; Fulton, Robert W; Bauermann, Fernando V; Falkenberg, Shollie M; Welch, Jenny; Confer, Anthony W",J Vet Diagn Invest,,333

Lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine show in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have been used for the treatment of COVID-19. Both, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The impact of a triple therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) on kidney function in COVID-19 is currently not known. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed both non-ICU and ICU patients with COVID-19 receiving triple therapy for the incidence of AKI. Patients receiving standard therapy served as a control group. All patients were hospitalized at the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany, between March and April 2020. A matched-pair analysis for the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 was performed to control for the severity of illness among non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. RESULTS: In non-ICU patients, the incidence of AKI was markedly increased following triple therapy (78.6% vs. 21.4% in controls, p = 0.002), while a high incidence of AKI was observed in both groups of ICU patients (triple therapy: 80.0%, control group: 90.5%). ICU patients treated with triple therapy showed a trend towards more oliguric or anuric kidney injury. We also observed a linear correlation between the duration of the triple therapy and the maximum serum creatinine level (p = 0.004, R2 = 0.276, R = 0.597). CONCLUSION: Triple therapy is associated with an increase in the incidence of AKI in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. The underlying mechanisms may comprise a CYP3A4 enzyme interaction, and may be relevant for any future therapy combining hydroxychloroquine with antiviral agents.","Schneider, Johanna; Jaenigen, Bernd; Wagner, Dirk; Rieg, Siegbert; Hornuss, Daniel; Biever, Paul M; Kern, Winfried V; Walz, Gerd",PLoS One,,333
462662,"Clinical evolution, management and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa: a research protocol",2020,"The main protease (3CL Mpro) from SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, is an essential enzyme for viral replication. 3CL Mpro possesses an unusual catalytic dyad composed of Cys145 and His41 residues. A critical question in the field has been what the protonation states of the ionizable residues in the substrate-binding active-site cavity are; resolving this point would help understand the catalytic details of the enzyme and inform rational drug development against this pernicious virus. Here, we present the room-temperature neutron structure of 3CL Mpro, which allowed direct determination of hydrogen atom positions and, hence, protonation states in the protease. We observe that the catalytic site natively adopts a zwitterionic reactive form in which Cys145 is in the negatively charged thiolate state and His41 is doubly protonated and positively charged, instead of the neutral unreactive state usually envisaged. The neutron structure also identified the protonation states, and thus electrical charges, of all other amino acid residues and revealed intricate hydrogen-bonding networks in the active-site cavity and at the dimer interface. The fine atomic details present in this structure were made possible by the unique scattering properties of the neutron, which is an ideal probe for locating hydrogen positions and experimentally determining protonation states at near-physiological temperature. Our observations provide critical information for structure-assisted and computational drug design, allowing precise tailoring of inhibitors to the enzyme's electrostatic environment.","Kneller, Daniel W; Phillips, Gwyndalyn; Weiss, Kevin L; Pant, Swati; Zhang, Qiu; O039,; Neill, Hugh M; Coates, Leighton; Kovalevsky, Andrey",J Biol Chem,,333

The aim of the study was to describe lung ultrasound findings in children with a COVID-19 infection. Patients younger than 18 years old and positive for COVID-19, admitted to pediatric tertiary referral hospital were included. They were divided into two groups depending on the presence of respiratory symptoms. Lung ultrasound results were categorized into four degrees according to Soldati et al. score (J Ultrasound Med 39:1-7, 2020) and it was also described the presence and type of consolidation. Sixteen patients were recruited. The median age was 11 years old (IQR 2.8-12). Four children (25%) required admission to the intensive care unit. Six patients (37.5%) presented with respiratory symptoms. Most of them showed S.score of 2 and subpleural consolidations were observed in four cases (66.6%). Ten patients (62.5%) presented with non-respiratory symptoms, lung ultrasound showed S.score from 0 to 2. Three (30%) were diagnosed of multisystem inflammatory syndrome and lung ultrasounds showed S.score of 2 with bilateral pleural effusion.Conclusions: Children with COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms mostly showed a S.score of 2 and 3 with subpleural consolidations, upon the lung ultrasound assessment. What is Known: â¢ Lung ultrasound is a useful tool for monitoring patients with respiratory symptoms in both adults and children. Lung ultrasounds are altered in adult patients with COVID-19. What is New: â¢ Lung ultrasound might improve COVID-19 assessment, it could be a useful tool to diagnose and monitor patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Even COVID-19 patients with non-respiratory symptoms have lung alterations that are visible on lung ultrasound.","Guitart, Carmina; Suárez, Ricardo; Girona, Mònica; Bobillo-Perez, Sara; Hernández, Lluïsa; Balaguer, Mònica; Cambra, Francisco José; Jordan, Iolanda",Eur. j. pediatr,,333

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2 ± 40.9 (BR) to 41.1 ± 25.3 µg m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45 ± 2.37 (BR) and 5.42 ± 1.75 µgC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 µg m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 µg m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3 ± 6.6 (BR) to 14.8 ± 9.3 µg m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6 ± 1.4 (BR) to 3.2 ± 2.0 µgC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources. Results from this work underscore challenges in predicting the benefits to PM2.5 improvement from emission reductions of common urban primary sources.","Zhu, Shuhui; Wang, Qiongqiong; Qiao, Liping; Zhou, Min; Wang, Shan; Lou, Shengrong; Huang, Dandan; Wang, Qian; Jing, Shengao; Wang, Hongli; Chen, Changhong; Huang, Cheng; Yu, Jian Zhen",Faraday Discuss,,333

467124,Comparison of Psychological Distress and Demand Induced by COVID-19 during the Lockdown Period in Patients Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis and Hemodialysis: A Cross-Section Study in a Tertiary Hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (2019-nCoV) has recently been identified in patients with acute respiratory disease. This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.","Chu, Daniel K W; Pan, Yang; Cheng, Samuel M S; Hui, Kenrie P Y; Krishnan, Pavithra; Liu, Yingzhi; Ng, Daisy Y M; Wan, Carrie K C; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M",Clin Chem,,333

The lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have further increased their use of video games and, consequently, the risk of gaming disorder (GD) symptoms. However, currently, we do not have exhaustive knowledge of this issue. To fill this gap, the current study aims to analyze video gaming habits in children and adolescents during the lockdown, starting in March 2020 in Italy, the first European country affected by the pandemic. Specifically, we aim to understand how variables related to parents-for instance, knowledge of their offspring's life, the monitoring of their video gaming habits, and parental use of video games-are related to their offspring's time spent on video games and GD symptoms. A web-based survey involving parents (n = 554, 79% mothers, mean age = 45.39) of 554 children and adolescents (73% males, mean age = 11.11) was utilized. The results showed that they were involved in video games, particularly boys and adolescents, with high rates of GD symptoms. The parents also spent a considerable amount of time playing video games. A path model that explained the mechanisms through which parental variables were related to their offspring's time spent on video games and GD symptoms, controlling for gender and age, was verified. Overall, the findings indicate the importance of educating parents to behave effectively with respect to video games and monitor their offspring's video gaming habits.","Donati, Maria Anna; Guido, Cristiana Alessia; De Meo, Giuliano; Spalice, Alberto; Sanson, Francesco; Beccari, Carola; Primi, Caterina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,333

The animals were arbitrarily allocated into four groups: group I rats administered a 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) vehicle orally for 15 consecutive days with a single intravenous standard saline injection (0.9% NaCl) on day seven. Groups II, III, and IV were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg MTX/kg on 7th day. Animals in group III and IV were treated orally for 14 days with 20 mg of SA/kg dissolved daily in 0.5% CMC respectively. In all experimental groups, liver function, biochemical, histopathological and molecular changes were evaluated. MTX-induced changes in liver function indices like ALT, AST, and ALP are substantially restored with SA pretreatment. Moreover, antioxidant defense mechanisms (GSH, SOD, and CAT) and oxidative/nitrostative stress (MDA and NO) and inflammatory cytokine (TNF-&#945;, IL-ß and MPO) were also substantially restored. Furthermore, the conclusions indicate that SA prevents the hepatic damage caused by MTX through apoptosis inhibition and stimulation of Nrf2/HO-1-medial antioxidant enzymes by NF-&#954;B inhibition.

A national online survey was administered between May and June 2020 that targeted a representative U.S. sample and yielded data from 1276 respondents, including 58% male and 50% racial/ethnic minorities. We used univariate and multivariable linear regression models to examine the associations of sociodemographic, mental health, and behavioral determinants with self-reported changes in lifestyle behaviors. Some study participants reported increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors since the pandemic (i.e., 36% increased healthy eating behaviors, and 33% increased physical activity). However, they also reported increases in addictive lifestyle behaviors including alcohol use (40%), tobacco use (41%), and vaping (46%). With regard to individual-level determinants, individuals who reported adhering to social distancing guidelines were also more likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors (beta = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.21). Conversely, women (beta = -0.37, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.12), and unemployed individuals (beta = -0.33, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.02) were less likely to report increases in healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, individuals reporting anxiety were more likely to report increases in addictive behaviors (beta = 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.43). Taken together, these findings suggest that women and unemployed individuals may benefit from interventions targeting diet and physical activity, and that individuals reporting anxiety may benefit from interventions targeting smoking and alcohol cessation to address lifestyle changes during the pandemic.","Zhang, X.; Oluyomi, A.; Woodard, L.; Raza, S.

469619,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on skin cancer diagnosis: A population-based study,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is causing major social changes to which significant psychological effects are linked. During the first phase of the pandemic wave in Italy, whilst there was insufficient information about the phenomenon and the strategies to safeguard the population against it, many categories of people, whose professions required constant contact with the public, were affected by the contagion. Aims: The literature has shown how religiousness can support the management of stress due to diseases and health risks. In relation to this, the current study wanted to investigate how priests managed the early stages of the pandemic. This work, therefore, aimed to investigate the psychological experiences related to the contagion and the eventual death of colleagues as well as the resilience strategies activated by the priests during the process. Participants: The research involved 12 Catholic priests, all male and aged between 42 and 63 years. They came from the same pastoral community in one of the regions in Northern Italy that were most affected during the first phase of the pandemic. Those ministers had been constantly in contact with the faithful of their parishes since the breakout of the virus. Methodology: A qualitative research design was adopted, and in-depth interviews were conducted. The dialogues aimed at investigating the deep, personal and relational experiences of the priests, together with their concerns and the tools they adopted to manage anxiety. The texts obtained from the interviews were subjected to thematic analysis. Results: The areas studied concerned the experiences of the participants during the lockdown, the implications of social distancing and lack of funeral rituality and, finally, the importance of prayer as a resilience factor. Conclusions: In the current scenario dominated by the pandemic, it is significant and stimulating to understand and reflect on the functions and roles of the experiences of faith, particularly the act of elaborating the process of mourning due to COVID-19.","Testoni, Ines; Zanellato, Silvia; Iacona, Erika; Marogna, Cristina; Cottone, Paolo; Bingaman, Kirk",Front Public Health,,333

In the context of today’s most critical uncertainty, i.e. COVID-19, the purpose of this study is to highlight the significance of two leadership styles, i.e. adaptive and academic leadership, and assessing readiness for change among higher education institutions (HEIs) of Punjab, Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted to collect data from 404 permanent faculty members in the public sector universities identified using stratified random sampling. The hypotheses developed were tested using co-variance-based structural equation modeling. Findings: As per the findings, both leadership styles as exogenous constructs and the presence of organizational learning capability as mediators contributed positively in crafting organizational readiness for change (ORC) among HEIs in the course of unpredictable circumstances. Practical implications: The COVID-19 episode globally has reiterated the importance of change, and the role of leadership in this regard cannot be undermined. This study, for that matter, stresses on the importance and benefits of academic and adaptive leadership dealing with uncertainties or change and the readiness of HEIs for change. Several institutions faced challenges in doing so, and the transition was not smooth, except for institutions where leaders were the differentiating factor. On top of it, institutions that had timely invested in digital systems and had enhanced organizations learning capacity survived in these turbulent times.

473622,"[Nurses: A Voice to Lead, Nursing the World to Health-Viewing COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention Efforts in Light of Nightingale's Perspective on Infection Control]",2020,"In February 2020, Nigeria faced a potentially catastrophic COVID-19 outbreak due to multiple introductions, high population density in urban slums, prevalence of other infectious diseases and poor health infrastructure. As in other countries, Nigerian policymakers had to make rapid and consequential decisions with limited understanding of transmission dynamics and the efficacy of available control measures. We present an account of the Nigerian COVID-19 response based on co-production of evidence between political decision-makers, health policymakers and academics from Nigerian and foreign institutions, an approach that allowed a multidisciplinary group to collaborate on issues arising in real time. Key aspects of the process were the central role of policymakers in determining priority areas and the coordination of multiple, sometime conflicting inputs from stakeholders to write briefing papers and inform effective national decision making. However, the co-production approach met with some challenges, including limited transparency, bureaucratic obstacles and an overly epidemiological focus on numbers of cases and deaths, arguably to the detriment of addressing social and economic effects of response measures. Larger systemic obstacles included a complex multitiered health system, fragmented decision-making structures and limited funding for implementation. Going forward, Nigeria should strengthen the integration of the national response within existing health decision bodies and implement strategies to mitigate the social and economic impact, particularly on the poorest Nigerians. The co-production of evidence examining the broader public health impact, with synthesis by multidisciplinary teams, is essential to meeting the social and public health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and other countries.","Abubakar, Ibrahim; Dalglish, Sarah L; Ihekweazu, Chikwe A; Bolu, Omotayo; Aliyu, Sani H",,,333
473624,"[Nurses: A Voice to Lead, Nursing the World to Health-Viewing COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention Efforts in Light of Nightingale's Perspective on Infection Control]",2020,"Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19. Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, looking at only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.","Ioannidis, John P A; Cripps, Sally; Tanner, Martin A",International journal of forecasting,,333

474486,"Advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic era among physicians in Taif, Saudi Arabia",2021,"Some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop acute pneumonia which can result in a cytokine storm syndrome in response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The most effective anti-inflammatory drugs employed so far in severe COVID-19 belong to the cytokine-directed biological agents, widely used in the management of many autoimmune diseases. In this paper we analyze the efficacy of epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant ingredient in green tea leaves and a well-known antioxidant, in counteracting autoimmune diseases, which are dominated by a massive cytokines production. Indeed, many studies registered that EGCG inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) transcription factors, whose activities are crucial in a multiplicity of downstream pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Importantly, the safety of EGCG/green tea extract supplementation is well documented in many clinical trials, as discussed in this review. Since EGCG can restore the natural immunological homeostasis in many different autoimmune diseases, we propose here a supplementation therapy with EGCG in COVID-19 patients. Besides some antiviral and anti-sepsis actions, the major EGCG benefits lie in its anti-fibrotic effect and in the ability to simultaneously downregulate expression and signaling of many inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, EGCG can be considered a potential safe natural supplement to counteract hyper-inflammation growing in COVID-19.","Menegazzi, Marta; Campagnari, Rachele; Bertoldi, Mariarita; Crupi, Rosalia; Di Paola, Rosanna; Cuzzocrea, Salvatore",,,333
476184,Dataset of the adapted COVID STRESS SCALES for Healthcare professionals of the Northeast region of Mexico,2021,"Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are genetic disorders of peroxisome biogenesis and metabolism that are characterized by profound developmental and neurological phenotypes. The most severe class of PBDs-Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD)-is caused by mutations in peroxin genes that result in both non-functional peroxisomes and mitochondrial dysfunction. It is unclear, however, how defective peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial impairment. In order to understand the molecular basis of this inter-organellar relationship, we investigated the fate of peroxisomal mRNAs and proteins in ZSD model systems. We found that peroxins were still expressed and a subset of them accumulated on the mitochondrial membrane, which resulted in gross mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired mitochondrial metabolic function. We showed that overexpression of ATAD1, a mitochondrial quality control factor, was sufficient to rescue several aspects of mitochondrial function in human ZSD fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that aberrant peroxisomal protein localization is necessary and sufficient for the devastating mitochondrial morphological and metabolic phenotypes in ZSDs.","Nuebel, Esther; Morgan, Jeffrey T; Fogarty, Sarah; Winter, Jacob M; Lettlova, Sandra; Berg, Jordan A; Chen, Yu-Chan; Kidwell, Chelsea U; Maschek, J Alan; Clowers, Katie J; Argyriou, Catherine; Chen, Lingxiao; Wittig, Ilka; Cox, James E; Roh-Johnson, Minna; Braverman, Nancy; Bonkowsky, Joshua; Gygi, Steven P; Rutter, Jared",EMBO Rep,,333

476607,How can we evaluate an interrelation of symptoms?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The lack of definitive treatment or preventative options for COVID-19 led many clinicians early on to consider convalescent plasma (CCP) as potentially therapeutic. Regulators, blood centres and hospitals worldwide worked quickly to get CCP to the bedside. Although response was admirable, several areas have been identified to help improve future pandemic management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary, multinational subgroup from the ISBT Working Group on COVID-19 was tasked with drafting a manuscript that describes the lessons learned pertaining to procurement and administration of CCP, derived from a comprehensive questionnaire within the subgroup. RESULTS: While each country's responses and preparedness for the pandemic varied, there were shared challenges, spanning supply chain disruptions, staffing, impact of social distancing on the collection of regular blood and CCP products, and the availability of screening and confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing for donors and patients. The lack of a general framework to organize data gathering across clinical trials and the desire to provide a potentially life-saving therapeutic through compassionate use hampered the collection of much-needed safety and outcome data worldwide. Communication across all stakeholders was identified as being central to reducing confusion. CONCLUSION: The need for flexibility and adaptability remains paramount when dealing with a pandemic. As the world approaches the first anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic with rising rates worldwide and over 115 million cases and 2·55 million deaths, respectively, it is important to reflect on how to better prepare for future pandemics as we continue to combat the current one.","Wendel, Silvano; Land, Kevin; Devine, Dana V; Daly, James; Bazin, Renée; Tiberghien, Pierre; Lee, Cheuk-Kwong; Arora, Satyam; Patidar, Gopal K; Khillan, Kamini; Smid, Willem Martin; Vrielink, Hans; Oreh, Adaeze; Al-Riyami, Arwa Z; Hindawi, Salwa; Vermeulen, Marion; Louw, Vernon; Burnouf, Thierry; Bloch, Evan M; Goel, Ruchika; Townsend, Mary; So-Osman, Cynthia",Vox sang,,333

Better understanding of population-level thrombotic risks after COVID-19 vaccination is needed. ObjectiveQuantify associations of vaccination with ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 with major arterial, venous and thrombocytopenic events. DesignCohort study based on linked electronic health records, with follow up from December 8th, 2020, to March 18th, 2021. Setting and participantsAdults registered with an NHS general practice in England and alive on December 8th, 2020. ExposuresFirst dose of vaccination with ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2. Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) for major arterial, venous and thrombocytopenic outcomes 1-28 and >28 days after first vaccination with ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 vaccine. Analyses were performed separately for ages <70 and [≥]70 years, and adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and social and demographic factors. ResultsOf 46,162,942 adults, 21,193,814 (46%) had their first vaccination during follow-up. Adjusted HRs 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S, compared with pre-vaccination rates, at ages <70 and [≥]70 respectively, were 0.97 (95% CI: 0.90-1.05) and 0.58 (0.53-0.63) for venous thromboses, and 0.90 (0.86-0.95) and 0.76 (0.73-0.79) for arterial thromboses. Corresponding HRs for BNT162b2 were 0.81 (0.74-0.88) and 0.57 (0.53-0.62) for venous thromboses, and 0.94 (0.90-0.99) and 0.72 (0.70-0.75) for arterial thromboses. HRs for thrombotic events were higher at younger ages for venous thromboses after ChAdOx1-S, and for arterial thromboses after both vaccines. Rates of intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) and thrombocytopenia in adults aged <70 years were higher 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S (adjusted HRs 2.27, 95% CI:1.33- 3.88 and 1.71, 1.35-2.16 respectively), but not after BNT162b2 (0.59, 0.24-1.45 and 1.00, 0.75-1.34) compared with pre-vaccination. The corresponding absolute excess risks of ICVT 1-28 days after ChAdOx1-S were 0.9-3 per million, varying by age and sex. Conclusions and RelevanceIncreases in ICVT and thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in adults aged <70 years are small compared with its effect in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, although more precise estimates for adults <40 years are needed. For people aged [≥]70 years, rates of arterial or venous thrombotic, events were generally lower after either vaccine.","Whiteley, William; Ip, Samantha; Cooper, Jennifer Anne; Bolton, Thomas; Keene, Spencer; Walker, Venexia; Denholm, Rachel; Akbari, Ashley; Omigie, Efosa; Hollings, Sam; Angelantonio, Emanuele Di; Denaxas, Spiros; Wood, Angela; Sterne, Jonathan; Sudlow, Cathie; consortium, - CVD-COVID-UK",,,333
477204,High death rate of older persons from COVID-19 in Quebec (Canada) long-term care facilities: chronology and analysis,2021,"Aims: myocardial involvement in the course of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has been reported, though not fully characterized yet Aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia Methods and results: in this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n ¼ 111 COVID-19 patients admitted to dedicated ""COVID-19"" medical units Hs-Troponin was assessed in n ¼ 103 patients and NP in n ¼ 82 patients on admission;subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38% and 56% of the cases respectively As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and D-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2 Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n ¼ 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricu-lar ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP only (p ¼ 0 02), whereas right ven-tricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p ¼ 0 022 and p ¼ 0 03 respectively) On multivariable analysis, independent associations were found of hs-Troponin with age, PaO2/FIO2 and D-dimer (B ¼ 0 419, p ¼ 0 001;B¼-0 212, p ¼ 0 013 and B ¼ 0 179, p ¼ 0 037 respectively), and of NP with age and previous CVD (B ¼ 0 480, p &lt; 0 001 and B ¼ 0 253, p ¼ 0 001 respectively) In patients with in-hospital mortality (n ¼ 23, 21%) hs-Troponin and NP were both higher (p ¼ 0 001 and p ¼ 0 002 respectively), while increasing hs-troponin and NP were associated with worse in-hospital prognosis [OR 4 88 (95% CI 1 9-12 2), p ¼ 0 001 (adjusted OR 3 1 (95% CI 1 2-8 5), p ¼ 0 025) and OR 4 67 (95% CI 2-10 8), p &lt; 0 001 (adjusted OR 2 89 (95% CI 1 1-7 9), p ¼ 0 04) respectively] Receiver operator characteristic curves showed good ability of hs-Troponin and NP in predicting in-hospital mortality (AUC ¼ 0 869 p &lt; 0 001 and AUC ¼ 0 810, p &lt; 0 001 respectively) Conclusion: myocardial involvement at admission is common in COVID-19 pneumonia and associated to worse prognosis, suggesting a role for cardiac biomarkers assessment in COVID-19 risk stratification Independent associations of hs-Troponin with markers of disease severity and of NP with underlying CVD might point towards existing different mechanisms leading to their elevation in this setting 235 Percutaneous urgent treatment of severe aortic stenosis in a patient during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: role of balloon aortic valvuloplasty Aims: The majority of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures are performed on an elective basis and, therefore, have been postponed during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak However, delay in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis (AS) may increase the risk of adverse events, particularly in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities Methods and results: An 86-year-old man, affected by severe AS was referred to our Institution from a spoke centre due to decompensated heart failure refractory to optimal medical therapy Three months before, the patient was evaluated by our Heart Team and was scheduled for TAVI Since that time, he had been waiting for elective TAVI procedure, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak spark Due to the clinical and computed tomography suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection he underwent nasopharyngeal swab and was temporarily isolated However, the rapid deterioration of clinical and hemodynamic conditions required emergency treatment We performed a balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) as a bridge for TAVI, and achieved a reduction of the invasive transaortic gradient from 43 to 10 mmHg after one inflation The patient's clinical and hemodynamic conditions markedly improved within a few hours;the next day, the result of the reverse-tras-criptase polymer chain reaction fo COVID-19 was negative At day five, he underwent TAVI procedure with implantation of a CoreValve Evolut TM Pro 29 Subsequent clinical course was uneventful Conclusion: In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, the deferral of TAVI procedure should be assessed on a case-by-case basis in order to avoid delay in patients at high risk for adverse events BAV may be an option in heart failure patients with severe AS when TAVI is temporarily contraindicated such as in patients suspected for COVID-19 Aims: Conflicting results are available regarding the influence of ACEi/ARBs on the risk of COVID-19 infection, while less is known about their impact on clinical outcome of STEMI patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 Our aim was to evaluate the impact of ACEi/ARBs therapy on in-hospital mortality and clinical outcomes of STEMI patients during COVID-19 pandemic Methods and results: We retrospectively analysed consecutive STEMI patients hospi-talised from February 20, to May 10, 2020 at four Hospitals in Lombardy SARS-COV-2 diagnosis was performed by nasopharingeal swab test Procedural outcome, respiratory complications and in-hospital mortality were reported Univariate and multivari-ate analysis were performed by logistic regressions Our population was represented by 182 STEMI patients, 76 9% male, mean age 67þ/-12 5 Hypertension was reported in 53 3%, treated with ACEi/ARBs in 29 1% COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed in 17 1% In-hospital mortality (13 2%) was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (31% vs 10%, p ¼ 0 003), even if ejection fraction (OR 0 93[95%CI]0 87-0 99;p ¼ 0 03) and respiratory complications (OR 9 39[95%CI]1 91-45 9;p ¼ 0 006) result the only two independent predictors The incidence of COVID-19 infection was not influenced by ACEi/ARBs (16 5% in naı¨venaı¨ve vs 18 8%) whose presence at admission did not correlate with respiratory complications or mortality both in case of discontinuation or manteinance Conclusion: In a high-risk population, such as that of STEMIs, the potential benefit of ACEi/ARBs discontinuation in COVID-19 patients is overcome by its detrimental effect Intensive care, additional preventive respiratory investigations, regardless from swab test result, should be suggested among all patients admitted for STEMI during pandemic","Arcari, Luca

This study aims to understand the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and identify risk and protective factors during pregnancy. METHODS: Participants were 303 pregnant individuals from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety and insomnia were measured using validated questionnaires. COVID-related experiences (i.e., financial difficulties, relationship conflict, social isolation) were assessed in relation to mental health. Social support and cognitive appraisal of the pandemic were examined as protective factors. RESULTS: 57% of the sample reported clinically elevated depression, >30% reported elevated worries, and 19% reported elevated insomnia. Depression (t = 25.14, p < .0001) and anxiety (t = 17.21, p < .0001) levels were higher than non-COVID pregnant samples. Social isolation, financial trouble, relationship difficulties and threat of COVID-19 were associated with mental health. Social support (rrange -.24 to -.38, p <.01) was associated with lower mental health problems and negative cognitive appraisal (rrange .20 to .33, p <.01) was linked to more mental health problems. Furthermore, social support and cognitive appraisal interacted (ß = -.92, SE = .41, p < .05), such that higher social support acted as a protective factor, particularly for those who appraise the impact of COVID-19 to be more negative. CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the need to address the high rates of mental health during pregnancy and outline potential targets (cognitive appraisal and social support) to protect pregnant people from experiencing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khoury, Jennifer E; Atkinson, Leslie; Bennett, Teresa; Jack, Susan M; Gonzalez, Andrea",J Affect Disord,,333

OBJECTIVE: To understand barriers to physical distancing among HCWs on an inpatient unit and identify strategies for improvement. DESIGN: Qualitative study including observations and semistructured interviews conducted over 3 months. SETTING: A non-COVID-19 adult general medical unit in an academic tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCWs based on the unit. METHODS: We performed a qualitative study in which we (1) observed HCW activities and proximity to each other on the unit during weekday shifts July-October 2020 and (2) conducted semi-structured interviews of HCWs to understand their experiences with and perspectives of physical distancing in the hospital. Qualitative data were coded based on a human-factors engineering model. RESULTS: We completed 25 hours of observations and 20 HCW interviews. High-risk interactions often occurred during handoffs of care at shift changes and patient rounds, when HCWs gathered regularly in close proximity for at least 15 minutes. Identified barriers included spacing and availability of computers, the need to communicate confidential patient information, and the desire to maintain relationships at work. CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing can be improved in hospitals by restructuring computer workstations, work rooms, and break rooms; applying visible cognitive aids; adapting shift times; and supporting rounds and meetings with virtual conferencing. Additional strategies to promote staff adherence to physical distancing include rewarding positive behaviors, having peer leaders model physical distancing, and encouraging additional safe avenues for social connection at a safe distance.","Keller, Sara C; Pau, Sara; Salinas, Alejandra B; Oladapo-Shittu, Opeyemi; Cosgrove, Sara E; Lewis-Cherry, Robin; Vecchio-Pagan, Briana; Osei, Patience; Gurses, Ayse P; Rock, Clare; Sick-Samuels, Anna C",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,333

Potential candidates are tested in adult populations, and questions arise of whether COVID-19 vaccination should be implemented in children. Compared to adults, the incidence and disease severity of COVID-19 are low in children, and despite their infectiveness, their role in disease propagation is limited. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines will need to have fully demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing not only complications but transmission to justify childhood vaccination. This work summarizes currently tested vaccine platforms and debates practical and ethical considerations for their potential use in children. It also discusses the already deleterious effect of the pandemic on routine childhood vaccine coverage, calling for action to limit the risks for a rise in vaccine-preventable diseases.","Eberhardt, Christiane Sigrid; Siegrist, Claire-Anne",Pediatr. allergy immunol,,333

485964,COVID-19 and long-term care,2020,"BACKGROUND: To permit timely mitigation of adverse effects on overall clinical outcome, it is essential to understand how the pandemic influences distress and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in cancer patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, adult cancer patients, without COVID-19 symptoms, completed a 13-item questionnaire about the pandemic's impacts on distress and everyday-life; associations with age, sex, or impaired HRQOL were then assessed by binary logistic regressions. In a subsample of patients with HRQOL assessment available from both before and during the pandemic, we evaluated the pandemic's impact on longitudinal changes in HRQOL reported within 6 months before versus during the COVID-19 lockdown using McNemar's test, and thresholds for clinical importance. RESULTS: We consecutively enrolled 240 patients with solid (50%) or hematological (50%) cancers. Median age was 67 years, 46% were females. The majority ranked heeding their health (80%) and keeping their appointment schedule in hospital (78%) as important. Being younger than 60, or aged 60-70 was independently associated with limitations in everyday life (OR = 3.57, p < 0.001; and 2.05, p = 0.038); female individuals and those with restricted emotional functioning were more distressed by the COVID-19 situation (OR = 2.47, p = 0.040; and 3.17, p = 0.019); the latter group was also significantly more concerned about being a patient at risk (OR = 2.21, p = 0.029). Interestingly, in a subsample of patients (n = 47), longitudinal comparisons pre- versus during the pandemic revealed that HRQOL was not substantially affected by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Particularly younger and female cancer patients, and those with impaired emotional functioning are distressed by COVID-19. During the first COVID-19 lockdown, cancer patients remained predominantly resilient. This analysis highlights the need to mitigate distress situations in vulnerable patients and thereby enhance resilience during pandemics.","Koinig, Karin A; Arnold, Christoph; Lehmann, Jens; Giesinger, Johannes; Köck, Stefan; Willenbacher, Wolfgang; Weger, Roman; Holzner, Bernhard; Ganswindt, Ute; Wolf, Dominik; Stauder, Reinhard",Cancer med,,333

AIM OF STUDY: We evaluated the prevalence and the impact of comorbidities in thalassemia Iranian patients affected by COVID-19. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted across all comprehensive thalassemia centers in Iran, from January to June 15th, 2020. RESULTS: Forty-three confirmed COVID-19 thalassemia patients (32 TDT, and 11 NTDT) were detected. The mean age of patients was 35.3 ± 11.5 years (range 9 - 67); 21 females and 22 males. Overall, 78.1% of TDT and 90.9% of NTDT patients were complicated with at least one comorbidity (P: 0.656). The overall mortality rate of thalassemia patients with COVID-19 was 18.6% while 27.3% was in NTDT patients compared to 15.6% in TDT patients (P:0.401). The dead group had a non-significant higher frequency of endocrinopathies compared to the recovered group (62.5% versus 45.7% P:0.457). Ten female thalassemia patients with positive COVID-19 had hypogonadism, six patients were receiving hormone replacement therapy and all of them recovered (zero death) compared to two deaths from 4 patients who were not receiving hormone replacement therapy (P:0.133). Furthermore, the prevalence of COVID-19 in NTDT patients was significantly higher than the general population (45 per 10,000 versus 22.29 per 10,000 respectively, P:0.018) while the prevalence of TDT was almost similar to the normal population (P:0.539). The mortality rate of COVID-19 was 4.71% in the normal Iranian population compared to 18.6% in ß-thalassemias (P: <0.001) at the same date. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to acknowledge that ß-thalassemia patients, especially young adults/adults, have a chronic condition which may contribute to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A higher susceptibility to the infection was observed in patients with NTDT and in untreated hypogonadal female thalassemic patients. However, to confirm these data, more accurate designed studies are needed.","Karimi, Mehran; Haghpanah, Sezaneh; Zarei, Tahereh; Azarkeivan, Azita; Shirkavand, Afshan; Matin, Sara; Tavakoli, Maryam Akavan; Zahedi, Zohre; De Sanctis, Vincenzo",Acta Biomed,,333

As SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus have been found in patients, understanding the in vivo characteristics of the secondary infection between these two viruses is a high priority. Here, hACE2 transgenic mice were challenged with the H1N1 virus at a nonlethal dose during the convalescent stage on 7 and 14 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection, and importantly, subsequent H1N1 infection showed enhanced viral shedding and virus tissue distribution. Histopathological observation revealed an extensive pathological change in the lungs related to H1N1 infection in mice recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with severe inflammation infiltration and bronchiole disruption. Moreover, upon H1N1 exposure on 7 and 14 dpi of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the lymphocyte population activated at a lower level with T cell suppressed in both PBMC and lung. These findings will be valuable for evaluating antiviral therapeutics and vaccines as well as guiding public health work.","Li, Heng; Zhao, Xin; Zhao, Yurong; Li, Jing; Zheng, Huiwen; Xue, Mengyi; Guo, Lei; Zhou, Jian; Yang, Jinling; Zuo, Yuanyuan; Chen, Yanli; Yang, Zening; Fan, Qiqi; Qin, Li; Shi, Haijing; Liu, Longding",Emerg Microbes Infect,,333

The emerging virus, SARS-CoV-2, causes coughing, fever, muscle ache, and shortness of breath or dyspnea in symptomatic patients. The pathogenic particles that are generated by coughing and sneezing remain suspended in the air or attach to a surface to facilitate transmission in an aerosol form. This review focuses on the recent trends in pandemic biology, diagnostics methods, prevention tools, and policies for COVID-19 management. To meet the growing demand for medical supplies during the COVID-19 era, a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators have been developed using do-it-yourself (DIY) manufacturing. COVID-19 diagnosis and the prediction of virus transmission are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, simulations, and digital monitoring. Until the discovery of a clinically approved vaccine for COVID-19, pandemics remain a public concern. Therefore, technological developments, biomedical research, and policy development are needed to decipher the coronavirus mechanism and epidemiological characteristics, prevent transmission, and develop therapeutic drugs.","Allam, Mayar; Cai, Shuangyi; Ganesh, Shambavi; Venkatesan, Mythreye; Doodhwala, Saurabh; Song, Zexing; Hu, Thomas; Kumar, Aditi; Heit, Jeremy; Study Group, Covid-; Coskun, Ahmet F",,,333

However, if these measures are implemented for a long period of time, they can result in adverse modification of people's health perceptions and lifestyle behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-national survey was to address the lack of adequate real-time data on the public response to changes in lifestyle behavior during the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-national web-based survey was administered using Google Forms during the month of April 2020. The settings were China, Japan, Italy, and India. There were two primary outcomes: (1) response to the health scale, defined as perceived health status, a combined score of health-related survey items; and (2) adoption of healthy lifestyle choices, defined as the engagement of the respondent in any two of three healthy lifestyle choices (healthy eating habits, engagement in physical activity or exercise, and reduced substance use). Statistical associations were assessed with linear and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We received 3371 responses; 1342 were from India (39.8%), 983 from China (29.2%), 669 from Italy (19.8%), and 377 (11.2%) from Japan. A differential countrywise response was observed toward perceived health status; the highest scores were obtained for Indian respondents (9.43, SD 2.43), and the lowest were obtained for Japanese respondents (6.81, SD 3.44). Similarly, countrywise differences in the magnitude of the influence of perceptions on health status were observed; perception of interpersonal relationships was most pronounced in the comparatively old Italian and Japanese respondents (ß=.68 and .60, respectively), and the fear response was most pronounced in Chinese respondents (ß=.71). Overall, 78.4% of the respondents adopted at least two healthy lifestyle choices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike health status, the influence of perception of interpersonal relationships on the adoption of lifestyle choices was not unanimous, and it was absent in the Italian respondents (odds ratio 1.93, 95% CI 0.65-5.79). The influence of perceived health status was a significant predictor of lifestyle change across all the countries, most prominently by approximately 6-fold in China and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: The overall consistent positive influence of increased interpersonal relationships on health perceptions and adopted lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic is the key real-time finding of the survey. Favorable behavioral changes should be bolstered through regular virtual interpersonal interactions, particularly in countries with an overall middle-aged or older population. Further, controlling the fear response of the public through counseling could also help improve health perceptions and lifestyle behavior. However, the observed human behavior needs to be viewed within the purview of cultural disparities, self-perceptions, demographic variances, and the influence of countrywise phase variations of the pandemic. The observations derived from a short lockdown period are preliminary, and real insight could only be obtained from a longer follow-up.","Manjunath, Nandi Krishnamurthy; Majumdar, Vijaya; Rozzi, Antonietta; Huiru, Wang; Mishra, Avinash; Kimura, Keishin; Nagarathna, Raghuram; Nagendra, Hongasandra Ramarao",JMIR Form Res,,333
492709,Corona Virus: Global Pandemic Causing World-Wide Shutdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine hospital services globally. This study estimated the total number of adult elective operations that would be cancelled worldwide during the 12 weeks of peak disruption due to COVID-19. METHODS: A global expert response study was conducted to elicit projections for the proportion of elective surgery that would be cancelled or postponed during the 12 weeks of peak disruption. A Bayesian ß-regression model was used to estimate 12-week cancellation rates for 190 countries. Elective surgical case-mix data, stratified by specialty and indication (surgery for cancer versus benign disease), were determined. This case mix was applied to country-level surgical volumes. The 12-week cancellation rates were then applied to these figures to calculate the total number of cancelled operations. RESULTS: The best estimate was that 28 404 603 operations would be cancelled or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19 (2 367 050 operations per week). Most would be operations for benign disease (90·2 per cent, 25 638 922 of 28 404 603). The overall 12-week cancellation rate would be 72·3 per cent. Globally, 81·7 per cent of operations for benign conditions (25 638 922 of 31 378 062), 37·7 per cent of cancer operations (2 324 070 of 6 162 311) and 25·4 per cent of elective caesarean sections (441 611 of 1 735 483) would be cancelled or postponed. If countries increased their normal surgical volume by 20 per cent after the pandemic, it would take a median of 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting from COVID-19 disruption. CONCLUSION: A very large number of operations will be cancelled or postponed owing to disruption caused by COVID-19. Governments should mitigate against this major burden on patients by developing recovery plans and implementing strategies to restore surgical activity safely.",,Br J Surg,,333
493126,To evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown on patient care at a tertiary-care ophthalmology institute,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions can adversely impact antenatal maternal well-being and health behaviours. AIM: To examine antenatal stress and stress-reduction strategies, social support, and health behaviours between women pregnant before and during the pandemic in Ireland. METHODS: 210 pregnant women were recruited online and in the antenatal department of a tertiary maternity hospital before the pandemic, and 235 women recruited online during the pandemic. Only women resident in Ireland were included in this study. Women completed measures of stress, social support, health-behaviours, and self-reported stress-reduction strategies. Differences in outcomes were examined between women pregnant before and during the pandemic, and between Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Irish Government COVID-19 restrictions. FINDINGS: Women pregnant during the pandemic reported lower perceived social support, including support from a significant other, friends and family, than women pregnant before the pandemic. There were no significant differences in stress in health behaviours but women reported higher stress and less physical activity during the pandemic. Women reported a range of comparable stress-reduction strategies before and during the pandemic. No differences were observed between phases of pandemic-related restrictions for any outcome. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight negative impacts of the pandemic on social support, stress, and physical activity, which can have implications for maternal and child health. Lack of differences between restriction phases suggests on-going negative effects for antenatal well-being and behaviours. CONCLUSION: Development of supports for pregnant women during the pandemic should include social-support and stress-reduction components.","Matvienko-Sikar, Karen; Pope, Johanna; Cremin, Avril; Carr, Hayley; Leitao, Sara; Olander, Ellinor K; Meaney, Sarah",Women and birth (Online),,333

496351,ICU outcomes and survival in patients with severe COVID-19 in the largest health care system in central Florida,2021,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality of lung diseases although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully uncovered. Airway inflammation is a critical event in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. This study aimed to examine the role of oxidative stress and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in PM2.5-induced pro-inflammatory response in a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B. METHODS: BEAS-2B cells were exposed to 0, 20, 50, 100 and 150 µg/ml of PM2.5. Secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and IL-1ß was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined using flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of the EGFR was examined with immunoblotting. RESULTS: PM2.5 exposure increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1ß in a concentration-dependent fashion. Moreover, exposure to PM2.5 elevated intracellular levels of ROS, and phosphorylation of the EGFR (Y1068). Pretreatment of BEAS-2B cells with either an antioxidant or a specific EGFR inhibitor significantly reduced PM2.5-induced IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1ß secretion, implying that both oxidative stress and EGFR activation were involved in PM2.5-induced pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, pre-treatment of BEAS-2B cells with an antioxidant significantly blunted PM2.5-induced EGFR activation, suggesting that oxidative stress was required for PM2.5-induced EGFR activation. CONCLUSION: PM2.5 exposure induces pro-inflammatory response in human bronchial epithelial cells through oxidative stress-mediated EGFR activation.","Wang, Gui; Zhang, Guofu; Gao, Xia; Zhang, Yange; Fan, Wei; Jiang, Jing; An, Zhen; Li, Juan; Song, Jie; Wu, Weidong",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,,333

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a snapshot analysis of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 Pakistani patients during the period from May to July 2020, when the first wave of COVID-19 peaked in Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed to provide an overview of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the four major tertiary-care hospitals in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad region of Pakistan during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country (May-July 2020). RESULTS: Antibiotics were the most common choice out of all the therapies employed, and they were used as first line of treatment for COVID-19. Azithromycin was the most prescribed drug for treatment. No monthly trend was observed in the choice of antibiotics, and these drugs appeared to be a random but favored choice throughout the months of the study. It was also noted that even antibiotics used for multidrug resistant infections were prescribed irrespective of the severity or progression of the infection. The results of the analysis are alarming, as this approach may lead to antibiotic resistance and complications in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. A total of 1562 patients (1064 male, 68.1%, and 498 female, 31.9%) with a mean age of 47.35 years (SD 17.03) were included in the study. The highest frequency of patient hospitalizations occurred in June (846/1562, 54.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for a targeted treatment regime are needed to control related complications and to limit the misuse of antibiotics in the management of COVID-19.","Akhtar, Hashaam; Akhtar, Samar; Rahman, Fazal-Ul; Afridi, Maham; Khalid, Sundas; Ali, Sabahat; Akhtar, Nasim; Khader, Yousef S; Ahmad, Hamaad; Khan, Muhammad Mujeeb",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,333
498721,"Letter to the Editor ""Service and Training During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives from a Neurosurgical Center in the Philippines""",2020,"The COVID-19 has become a pandemic. The timing and nature of the COVID-19 pandemic response and control varied among the regions and from one country to the other, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. The focus of this work is on the early phase of the disease when control measures can be most effective. We proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model based on temporal moving windows to quantify COVID-19 transmission patterns and compare the temporal progress of disease spread in six representative regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). It was found that in the early phase of COVID-19 spread the disease follows a certain empirical law that is common in all regions considered. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Measure-dependent transmission rates followed a modified normal distribution (empirical law) in the three Chinese regions. These rates responded quickly to the launch of the 1st-level Response to Major Public Health Emergency in each region, peaking after 1-2 days, reaching their inflection points after 10-19 days, and dropping to zero after 11-18 days since the 1st-level response was launched. By March 29th, the mortality rates were 0.08% (Zhejiang), 0.54% (Guangdong) and 3.95% (Xinjiang). Subsequent modeling simulations were based on the working assumption that similar infection transmission control measures were taken in South Korea as in Zhejiang on February 25th, in Italy as in Guangdong on February 25th, and in Iran as in Xinjiang on March 8th. The results showed that by June 15th the accumulated infection cases could have been reduced by 32.49% (South Korea), 98.16% (Italy) and 85.73% (Iran). The surface air temperature showed stronger association with transmission rate of COVID-19 than surface relative humidity. On the basis of these findings, disease control measures were shown to be particularly effective in flattening and shrinking the COVID-10 case curve, which could effectively reduce the severity of the disease and mitigate medical burden. The proposed empirical law and the SEIR-temporal moving window model can also be used to study infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.","He, Junyu; Chen, Guangwei; Jiang, Yutong; Jin, Runjie; Shortridge, Ashton; Agusti, Susana; He, Mingjun; Wu, Jiaping; Duarte, Carlos M; Christakos, George",Sci Total Environ,,333

SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with a unique metabolic phenotype and demonstrated a complex systemic response to infection, including severe perturbations in amino acid and kynurenine metabolic pathways. Nine metabolites were elevated in plasma and strongly associated with infection (quinolinic acid, glutamic acid, nicotinic acid, aspartic acid, neopterin, kynurenine, phenylalanine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and taurine; p < 0.05), while four metabolites were lower in infection (tryptophan, histidine, indole-3-acetic acid, and citrulline; p < 0.05). This signature supports a systemic metabolic phenoconversion following infection, indicating possible neurotoxicity and neurological disruption (elevations of 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid) and liver dysfunction (reduction in Fischer's ratio and elevation of taurine). Finally, we report correlations between the key metabolite changes observed in the disease with concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines showing strong immunometabolic disorder in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lawler, Nathan G; Gray, Nicola; Kimhofer, Torben; Boughton, Berin; Gay, Melvin; Yang, Rongchang; Morillon, Aude-Claire; Chin, Sung-Tong; Ryan, Monique; Begum, Sofina; Bong, Sze How; Coudert, Jerome D; Edgar, Dale; Raby, Edward; Pettersson, Sven; Richards, Toby; Holmes, Elaine; Whiley, Luke; Nicholson, Jeremy K",J Proteome Res,,333

501682,"Reply: ""Biologics for psoriasis during COVID-19 outbreak""",2020,"A growing body of evidence suggests that diet quality may predict muscle health. This study found that a ""Traditional"" dietary pattern predicted greater muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet predicted greater muscle mass and better muscle function over 15 years. These findings reinforce the importance of optimising dietary behaviours for healthy ageing. INTRODUCTION: Research investigating the roles of individual nutrients in muscle health fails to account for the synergistic relationships between foods and nutrients. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of diet quality and dietary patterns for muscle mass and function in men over a 15-year period. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in 522 men from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study with complete dietary and muscle mass or muscle function data at both baseline and 15-year follow-up assessments. Dietary exposures were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and included the Australian Recommended Food Score, the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and three a posteriori dietary patterns: Plant-focused, Western, and Traditional (Anglo-Australian). Outcome variables included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle function measured with the timed up-and-go (TUG) test. RESULTS: An anti-inflammatory diet and higher scores on a Traditional dietary pattern both predicted greater SMI ((B: -0.04 (95%CI -0.08, -0.00) kg/m2) and (B: 0.12 (95%CI 0.04, 0.20) kg/m2), respectively), while a pro-inflammatory diet predicted slower TUG (B: 0.11 (95%CI 0.001, 0.21) sec) over the 15-year follow-up period. These associations remained significant following adjustment for confounding variables. There were no associations observed for other dietary exposures. CONCLUSION: A Traditional dietary pattern higher in vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and animal protein was associated with greater skeletal muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet, also rich in vegetables, fruit, and wholegrain cereals, was associated with greater skeletal muscle mass and better muscle function over 15 years.","Davis, J A; Mohebbi, M; Collier, F; Loughman, A; Staudacher, H; Shivappa, N; Hébert, J R; Pasco, J A; Jacka, F N",Osteoporosis int,,333

Currently, we are facing the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first symptoms similar to the flu. The symptom of COVID-19 was reported first in China and very quickly spreads to the rest of the world. The COVID-19 contagiousness is known to be high by comparison with the flu. In this paper, we propose a design of a mobile application for permitting everyone having a smartphone and being able to take a picture to verify that his/her protection mask is correctly positioned on his/her face. Such application can be particularly useful for people using face protection mask for the first time and notably for children and old people. The designed method exploits Haar-like feature descriptors to detect key features of the face and a decision-making algorithm is applied. Experimental results show the potential of this method in the validation of the correct mask wearing. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the only one that currently proposes a mobile application design “CheckYourMask” for validating the correct wearing of protection mask.","Hammoudi, Karim; Cabani, Adnane; Benhabiles, Halim; Melkemi, Mahmoud",CMES Comput.

Subsequently, we turn to the technological level and present the digital supply chain twin as a contemporary instrument for stress testing supply chain resilience. We provide some implementation guidelines and emphasize that although resilience assessment of individual supply chains is important and critical for firms, viability analysis of intertwined supply networks and ecosystems represents a novel and impactful research perspective. One of the major outcomes of this essay is the conceptualization of a human-centred ecosystem viability perspective on supply chain resilience.","Ivanov, D.; Dolgui, A.",Operations Management Research,,333

Initially, 510 hospital admissions were counted in the study, out of which 310 patients did not survive. A prediction model was developed based on this data by using a Bayesian approach. Following the data collection process for the development study, the second cohort of patients totaling 541 was built to validate the risk matrix previously created. The final model has an area under the curve of 0.773 and predicts the mortality risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on nine disease groups while considering the gender and age of the patient as distinct risk groups. To ease medical workers’ assessment of patients, we created a visual risk matrix based on a probabilistic model, ranging from a score of 1 (very low mortality risk) to 5 (very high mortality risk). Each score comprises a correlation between existing comorbid conditions, the number of comorbid conditions, gender, and age group category. This clinical model can be generalized in a hospital context and can be used to identify patients at high risk for whom immediate intervention might be required.","Marincu, I.; Bratosin, F.; Vidican, I.; Bostanaru, A.

METHODS: Two online Action Planning Forums (APFs) were organized by the Global Initiative for Children's Surgery (GICS) with a geographically diverse panel representing four children's surgical, anesthesia, and nursing subspecialties. Qualitative analysis was performed to identify codes, themes, and subthemes. RESULTS: The most frequently reported challenges were delayed access to care for children; fear among the public and patients; unavailability of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE); diversion of resources toward COVID-19 care; and interruption in student and trainee hands-on education. To address these challenges, panelists recommended human resource and funding support to minimize backlog; setting up international, multi-center studies for systematic data collection specifically for children; providing online educational opportunities for trainees and students in the form of large and small group discussions; developing best practice guidelines; and, most importantly, adapting solutions to local needs. CONCLUSION: Identification of key challenges and interventions to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global children's surgery via an objective, targeted needs assessment serves as an essential first step.

COVID-19 symptoms are polymorphic and may include upper respiratory symptoms. However, COVID-19 symptoms may be mistaken with the common cold or allergic rhinitis. An ARIA-EAACI study group attempted to differentiate upper respiratory symptoms between the three diseases. METHODS: A modified Delphi process was used. The ARIA members who were seeing COVID-19 patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire on the upper airway symptoms of COVID-19, common cold and allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: Among the 192 ARIA members who were invited to respond to the questionnaire, 89 responded and 87 questionnaires were analysed. The consensus was then reported. A two-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in the symptom intensity between the three diseases (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This modified Delphi approach enabled the differentiation of upper respiratory symptoms between COVID-19, the common cold and allergic rhinitis. An electronic algorithm will be devised using the questionnaire.","Hagemann, Jan; Onorato, Gabrielle L; Jutel, Marek; Akdis, Cezmi A; Agache, Ioana; Zuberbier, Torsten; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Mullol, Joaquim; Bedbrook, Anna; Bachert, Claus; Bennoor, Kazi S; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Braido, Fulvio; Camargos, Paulo; Caraballo, Luis; Cardona, Victoria; Casale, Thomas; Cecchi, Lorenzo; Chivato, Tomas; Chu, Derek K; Cingi, Cemal; Correia-de-Sousa, Jaime; Del Giacco, Stefano; Dokic, Dejan; Dykewicz, Mark; Ebisawa, Motohiro; El-Gamal, Yehia; Emuzyte, Regina; Fauquert, Jean-Luc; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Fokkens, Wytske J; Fonseca, Joao A; Gemicioglu, Bilun; Gomez, René-Maximiliano; Gotua, Maia; Haahtela, Tari; Hamelmann, Eckard; Iinuma, Tomohisa; Ivancevich, Juan Carlos; Jassem, Ewa; Kalayci, Omer; Kardas, Przemyslaw; Khaitov, Musa; Kuna, Piotr; Kvedariene, Violeta; Larenas-Linnemann, Desiree E; Lipworth, Brian; Makris, Michael; Maspero, Jorge F; Miculinic, Neven",Allergy,,333

508771,Impact of COVID-19 Behavioral Inertia on Reopening Strategies for New York City Transit,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Although general principles related to vaccination hesitancy have been well researched, reports on reluctance to be vaccinated for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States are somewhat surprising, given the disease's substantive disruption of everyday life. However, the landscape in which people are making COVID-19 vaccination decisions has recently evolved with releases of encouraging vaccine-related data and changes to official messaging about the virus. Therefore, this study sought to identify factors associated with reported likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 among US adults in late January 2021. STUDY DESIGN: We used the Prolific online research panel to survey a nationally representative sample of 1017 US adults. METHODS: Respondents were asked about their behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccination, trust in science, perceptions related to COVID-19, and selected sociodemographic factors. We computed associations between those 11 independent variables and likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Around 73.9% of respondents indicated at least some likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Trust in science and perceived seriousness of COVID-19 were positively associated with intention to get vaccinated, and identifying as Black or African American was negatively associated with intention to get vaccinated. Other factors were moderately, weakly, or not at all associated with intention. CONCLUSIONS: Building trust in science and truthfully emphasizing the seriousness of catching COVID-19 should be further researched for their potential to support campaigns to encourage COVID-19 vaccination. Data continue to suggest the importance of dialogue with Black communities about COVID-19 vaccination.","Agley, J; Xiao, Y; Thompson, E E; Golzarri-Arroyo, L",Public Health,,333

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis performed on admitted cases with definitive final diagnoses of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke at King Abdullah Medical City in Makkah between January 1, 2020 and July 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included in our study, 41 of whom presented at our facility before the pandemic and 29 during the pandemic. No statistical significance was observed between rate of admission, stroke severity, and rate of thrombolysis before the COVID-19 pandemic and after the outbreak. We observed a reduction of mean arrival time after the pandemic began, as well as a reduction of hospital stay days. CONCLUSION: A 29% reduction of admission secondary to acute ischemic stroke was noted during the pandemic. However, COVID-19 did not affect acute stroke care at our institute. The study is limited because of its small sample size, as we assessed just one medical center.","Samkari, Ebaa T; Alkhotani, Amal M; Siddiqui, Mohammed I",Neurosciences (Riyadh),,333
509237,Should biologics for psoriasis be interrupted in the era of COVID-19?,2020,"There has been growing interest in exploring the coupled epidemic-awareness dynamics within the multiplex network framework Nevertheless, two important factors are not considered in the existing works, one is that the asymptomatic state is ignored in many epidemic dynamics, which can significantly affect the awareness and the epidemic dynamics simultaneously The other is that the self-initiated awareness mechanism is omitted, which addresses that individuals can be altered spontaneously by the infected neighbors rather than just be informed by others To this arm, we propose a novel coupled epidemic-awareness model in multiplex networks by incorporating these two factors and investigate their impacts on the dynamics of epidemic and awareness Based on the microscopic Markov chain approach and Monte-Carlo simulation, our findings indicate that the asymptomatic state makes people underestimate the risk of disease, leading to insufficient diffusion of awareness and further inducing the outbreak of epidemic On the contrary, even though the self-initiated mechanism plays a positive role on the control of epidemic, whose effect is also weakened by the existence of the asymptomatic state More importantly, a fundamental quantity underlying the spreading dynamics–the epidemic threshold is analytically derived","Wang, Huan Ma Chuang Chen Han-Shuang Zhang Hai-Feng",Applied Mathematics and Computation,,333

There has been a proliferation of research examining characteristics that can be targeted by public health interventions. This rapid review sought to identify predictors of attitudes toward and adherence to COVID-19 public health guidelines, and identify interventions aiming to improve adherence. METHODS: Articles were retrieved from multiple databases (e.g. MEDLINE, CINAHL and medRxiv) on 6 August 2020. Studies were limited to samples collected from Western countries. Studies were classified according to the types of factor (s) examined as independent variables. The consistency of evidence for each factor was scored by two reviewers. RESULTS: In total, 1323 unique articles were identified in the initial search, resulting in 29 studies in the final synthesis. The available evidence suggests individuals who are older, identify as women, trust governments, perceive COVID-19 as threatening and access information through traditional news media are more likely to adhere with COVID-19 public health guidelines. Interventions for improving adherence have not yet been investigated thoroughly, and this review identified only three experimental studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review has identified several characteristics that impact attitudes and adherence to COVID-19 public health guidelines.","Moran, Chelsea; Campbell, David J T; Campbell, Tavis S; Roach, Pamela; Bourassa, Lyne; Collins, Zoe; Stasiewicz, Marysia; McLane, Patrick",J. public health (Oxf),,333

The recent COVID-19 global pandemic has made wildlife consumption an issue that concerns everyone around the world. Formerly obscure practices like wet markets and commodities like pangolin scales or bear bile have gained international notoriety. Along with that attention has come increasing politicization and ideological polarization. Beyond the global fight against the pandemic, there has been another global struggle over the meaning and origin of the disease, as evidenced by the spread of terms like ""Wuhan Flu"" and ""bat soup."" What has become obscured by the news cycle struggling to keep up with the rapid spread of the virus and the political sound and fury surrounding it is any meaningful understanding of China's wildlife consumption and trade. Deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and history, the wildlife trade is not going away anytime soon. Despite a national ban, already wet markets are returning across China.

Care for patients with cancer is particularly important given increased infection rates and worse outcomes from COVID-19 in this patient population, as well as potential adverse outcomes if treatment pathways need to be compromised. In this commentary, we provide a global oncology pharmacy perspective (including both developed and developing nations) on how COVID-19 has impacted access to and delivery of cancer therapies. This perspective was prepared by the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners, with input from national and regional oncology pharmacy practice groups (42 practice leaders from 28 countries and regions) who contributed to a snapshot survey between 10 and 22 April 2020. Specifically, we highlight challenges related to safe handling of hazardous drugs and maintaining high-quality medication safety standards that have impacted various stakeholders.","Alexander, Marliese; Jupp, Jennifer; Chazan, Grace; O039,; Connor, Shaun; Chan, Alexandre",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,333
511885,The genetic landscape of COVID-19: A South Asian perspective,2020,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed considerable strain on hospital resources. We explored whether telemedicine (defined as a videoconference) might help. We undertook prospective structured phone interviews of urological patients (n = 399). We evaluated their suitability for telemedicine (judged by a panel of four physicians) and their risks from COVID-19 (10 factors for a poor outcome), and collected willingness for telemedicine and demographic data. Risk factors for an adverse outcome from COVID-19 infection were common (94.5% had one or more) and most patients (63.2%) were judged suitable for telemedicine. When asked, 84.7% of patients wished for a telemedical rather than a face-to-face consultation. Those favouring telemedicine were younger (68 [58-75] vs 76 [70-79.2] yr, p < 0.001). There was no difference in preference with oncological (mean 86%) or benign diagnoses (mean 85%), or with COVID-19 risks factors. In subgroup analysis, men with prostate cancer preferred telemedicine (odds ratio: 2.93 [1.07-8.03], p = 0.037). We concluded that many urological patients have risk factors for a poor outcome from COVID-19 and most preferred telemedicine consultations at this time. This appears to be a solution to offer contact-free continuity of care. PATIENT SUMMARY: Risk factors for a severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 are common (94.5%) in urology patients. Most patients wished for a telemedical consultation (84.7%).

ASRM acted quickly to develop guidelines for limiting fertility treatment and clinic consultations during the early days of the pandemic, and then safely restarting fertility treatment. A survey of patients with fertility-related diagnoses who presented for care during the first months of the pandemic revealed that a majority of patients who presented for care during the early months of the pandemic experienced delayed or cancelled treatment cycles. Patients with infertility subsequently reported a desire to resume fertility care, but emphasized the importance of their clinic having policies and procedures in place to limit the risk of infection.","Schirmer, Austin D; Kawwass, Jennifer F; Adashi, Eli Y",J Ovarian Res,,333

Since the launch of arXiv in 1991, preprints have been increasingly distributed over the Internet as opposed to paper copies. It allows open online access to disseminate the original research within a few days, often at a very low operating cost. This work overviews how preprint has been evolving and impacting the research community over the past thirty years alongside the growth of the Web. In this work, we first report that the number of preprints has exponentially increased 63 times in 30 years, although it only accounts for 4% of research articles. Second, we quantify the benefits that preprints bring to authors: preprints reach an audience 14 months earlier on average and associate with five times more citations compared with a non-preprint counterpart. Last, to address the quality concern of preprints, we discover that 41% of preprints are ultimately published at a peer-reviewed destination, and the published venues are as influential as papers without a preprint version. Additionally, we discuss the unprecedented role of preprints in communicating the latest research data during recent public health emergencies. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence to unveil the positive impact of preprints on individual researchers and the community. Preprints make scholarly communication more efficient by disseminating scientific discoveries more rapidly and widely with the aid of Web technologies. The measurements we present in this study can help researchers and policymakers make informed decisions about how to effectively use and responsibly embrace a preprint culture.","Xie, Boya; Shen, Zhihong; Wang, Kuansan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09066v1.pdf,333

The factors related to poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury are still unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential key factors leading to in-hospital death among COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury. This retrospective single-center study was conducted at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, from January 20, 2020 to April 10, 2020, in Wuhan, China. All inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 (&#8805; 18 years old) and cardiac injury who had died or were discharged by April 10, 2020 were included. Demographic data and clinical and laboratory findings were collected and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury. A total of 173 COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury were included in this study, 86 were discharged and 87 died in the hospital. Multivariable regression showed increased odds of in-hospital death were associated with advanced age (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.18, per year increase; p < 0.001), coagulopathy (2.54, 1.26-5.12; p = 0·009), acute respiratory distress syndrome (16.56, 6.66-41.2; p < 0.001), and elevated hypersensitive troponin I (4.54, 1.79-11.48; p = 0.001). A high risk of in-hospital death was observed among COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury in this study.

Darwinian evolution has organized each protein family in different ways, but dynamical hydropathic scaling theory is both simple and effective in providing readily transferable dynamical insights for many proteins represented in the uncounted amino acid sequences, as well as the 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base. Critical point theory is general, and recently it has proved to be the most effective way of describing protein networks that have evolved towards nearly perfect functionality in given environments, self-organized criticality. Darwinian evolutionary patterns are governed by common dynamical hydropathic scaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been developed bioinformatically by studying thousands of static PDB structures. The most effective dynamical scales involve hydropathic globular sculpting interactions averaged over length scales centered on domain dimensions. A central feature of dynamical hydropathic scaling theory is the characteristic domain length associated with a given protein functionality. Evolution has functioned in such a way that the minimal critical length scale established so far is about nine amino acids, but in some cases it is much larger. Some ingenuity is needed to find this primary length scale, as shown by the examples discussed here. Often a survey of the Darwinian evolution of a protein sequence suggests a means of determining the critical length scale. The evolution of Coronavirus is an interesting application; it identifies critical mutations.","Phillips, J. C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12727v1.pdf,333

The PyTz features small steric hindrance and low-energy LUMO (LUMO = -1.47 eV) locating over the &#960;* orbitals of the whole ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular charge transfer (CT) between a donor (carbazole) and an accepter (PyTz). These compounds exhibit efficient TADF with microsecond lifetimes. Temperature-dependent PL kinetics of 3a supports a rather small energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;ES1-T1 = 60 meV).

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of recent scientific literature to assess whether AKI may be associated with worse prognosis and increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between 1st November 2019 and 15th May 2020 on Medline (PubMed interface) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify potentially eligible studies. Cohort or case-control studies reporting data on AKI in patients with or without severe COVID-19 were included. Studies were divided into separate cohorts for analysis based on two endpoints (severity [severe vs non-severe] and mortality [non-survivors vs survivors]). Data were pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for either outcome. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (n= 5,832 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, AKI was found to be associated with significantly increased odds of COVID-19 severity (OR= 18.5; 95% CI 8.99-38.08) and mortality (OR= 23.9; 95% CI 18.84-30.31). No heterogeneity was observed for both outcomes (Cochran’s Q= 6.21, p=0.52, I(2)=0% and Cochran’s Q= 4.56, p=0.47, I(2)=0% respectively). CONCLUSION: According to current data, AKI seems to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism of renal disease in COVID-19 would be needed to clarify possible therapeutic targets.

In March 2020, we developed a COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) model to estimate the acute care resource use in Ontario, Canada. In this paper, we describe the evolution of CORE2.0 to incorporate age, sex, and time-dependent acute care resource use, length of stay, and mortality to simulate hospital occupancy. Demographics (e.g., age and sex) of infected cases are informed by 4-month averages between March-June, and July-October using 10-year age groups. The probability of hospitalization, ICU admission, and requiring mechanical ventilation are all age and sex-dependent. LOS for each acute care level ranges from 5.7 to 16.15 days in the ward, 6.5 to 10.7 days in the ICU without ventilation, and 14.8 to 21.6 days on the ventilator, depending on month of infection. We calibrated some LOS components to reported ward and ICU occupancy between June 15 and October 31, 2020. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of CORE2.0 for a regional analysis of Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada to simulate the ward bed, ICU bed, and ventilator occupancies for 30 days starting December 2020 for three case trajectory scenarios.

591150,COVID-19 has Affected Activities of Daily Living in Older Adults?,2021-10-31,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide. One of the most important hurdles in controlling the spread of this disease is the inefficiency and lack of medical tests. Computed tomography (CT) scans are promising in providing accurate and fast detection of COVID-19. However, determining COVID-19 requires highly trained radiologists and suffers from inter-observer variability. To remedy these limitations, this paper introduces an automatic methodology based on an ensemble of deep transfer learning for the detection of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 15 pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures: EfficientNets(B0-B5), NasNetLarge, NasNetMobile, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, SeResnet 50, Xception, DenseNet121, ResNext50 and Inception_resnet_v2 are used and then fine-tuned on the target task. After that, we built an ensemble method based on majority voting of the best combination of deep transfer learning outputs to further improve the recognition performance. We have used a publicly available dataset of CT scans, which consists of 349 CT scans labeled as being positive for COVID-19 and 397 negative COVID-19 CT scans that are normal or contain other types of lung diseases. RESULTS: The experimental results indicate that the majority voting of 5 deep transfer learning architecture with EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, EfficientNetB5, Inception_resnet_v2, and Xception has the higher results than the individual transfer learning structure and among the other models based on precision (0.857), recall (0.854) and accuracy (0.85) metrics in diagnosing COVID-19 from CT scans. CONCLUSION: Our study based on an ensemble deep transfer learning system with different pre-trained CNNs architectures can work well on a publicly available dataset of CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on CT scans.","gifani, Parisa; Shalbaf, Ahmad; Vafaeezadeh, Majid",Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191476/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-020-02286-w,333
591686,Qualitative exploration of the Medical Examiner role in identifying problems with the quality of patient care,2021-02-05,"One of the main challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic is the lack of safety measures and guidelines to reduce the risk of viral spread among people during gatherings. This study was conducted to evaluate the distance of oral and nasal droplet spread in a model that simulates coughing and sneezing in a public setting, specifically a school setting, to guide faculty and staff members with safety measures and guidelines to reduce droplet spread. Several models were prepared to observe and visualize the spread of fluid simulating respiratory droplets in places such as the classroom and the cafeteria, in which a student would be more susceptible to contract a virus since individuals cannot wear masks while eating. For all trials, a 2.54 centimeter balloon with 0.3 milliliters of diluted fluorescent paint was placed inside a mannequin head and was exploded outwards from the mannequin’s mouth at 5 pounds per square inch (psi). Using a black light, the expelled fluorescent macroscopic droplets were visualized. When applying safety precautions and guidelines such as mandating face masks, the results of the experiments conducted in this study with a surgical mask, were extremely positive. However, without other safety precautions such as face masks and barriers, social distancing proved to be ineffective. In conclusion the most effective way to prevent droplet spread during activities where masks simply cannot be worn, such as eating, is to apply barriers between the individuals. Applying barriers and wearing masks successfully prevented macroscopic droplet spread.","Bhavsar, Atreyus A.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951042/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250275,333

The European Cystic Fibrosis Society-Clinical Trials Network (ECFS-CTN) has tracked clinical trial disruption by surveying its 58 trial sites across 17 European countries and collated information on measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and ensure trial continuity. Here, we present recommendations on how to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure to patients and trial staff by implementing remote trial visits where possible, using home assessments, video and phone calls, electronic consent, and home delivery of study drugs. We discuss the practicalities of remote source data verification, protocol amendments, changing trial site location, and staff absences and home working. We outline recommendations on how to protect trial outcomes, including home assessments, safety reporting, protocol deviations, and recruitment challenges. Finally, we discuss the importance of continued access to study drugs via extension trials for some patients. This guidance was co-created from the shared knowledge and experience of sites in our network and was re-distributed directly to all ECFS-CTN sites to help mitigate the impact of further waves of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We will also use this guidance to assist companies, academia, and consortia with future protocol design and risk mitigation plans. This guidance can be applied to clinical trials in other diseases and could help sites that are not supported by clinical trial networks.","van Koningsbruggen-Rietschel, Silke; Dunlevy, Fiona; Bulteel, Veerle; Hayes, Kate; Verbrugge, Anne; Janssens, Hettie M.; Dufeu, Nadine; Simmonds, Nicholas J.; Dupont, Lieven J.; Downey, Damian G.",Trials,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454570/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05457-5,333

To do so, we conducted a search of 7 databases for relevant full-text articles. A cohort study and case-control study were included. A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the pooled odds ratio with a random-effects model. We identified studies that reported mortality among older adults with dementia and non-dementia who have COVID-19. The pooled mortality rates of dementia and non-dementia older adults infected with COVID-19 were 39% (95% CI: 0.23 – 0.54%, I(2)= 83.48%) and 20% (95% CI: 0.16 – 0.25%, I(2)= 83.48%), respectively. Overall, dementia was the main factor influencing poor health outcomes and high rates of mortality in older adults with COVID-19 infection (odds ratio 2.96; 95% CI 2.00 – 4.38, I(2)= 29.7%), respectively.

In the absence of specific vaccines and anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, medicines that may assist in tackling the emergency and limiting the high number of fatalities are urgently needed. The repositioning of available drugs to treat COVID-19 is the only and rapid option in the face of the lack of direct antiviral agents and vaccines available. In this light it is important to focus on available drugs, which, based on their pharmacodynamics, could plausibly attenuate viral growth as well as COVID-19’s worst complications. This is the case of chloroquine and tocilizumab which seem to limit virus replication and the severity of interstitial pneumonia, respectively. However, these treatments, particularly those aimed at containing inflammation, are still reserved for the most severe cases. This commentary elaborates on the pharmacological rationale of repositioning the mast cell stabilizer chromones as an adjunctive treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and proposes their practical clinical testing as an early, safe, and cost-effective anti-inflammatory intervention in COVID-19 to limit the eventual secondary progression toward life-threatening respiratory complications.","Sestili, Piero; Stocchi, Vilberto",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581809/,333

593416,Self-quarantine and Weight Gain Related Risk Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-21,"OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have shown that gratitude can improve mental health of people facing stressful events. However, most studies in this area have been based on laboratory experiments and retrospective surveys, rather than actual situations in which people are experiencing stress. Moreover, few studies have examined whether age moderates the benefits of gratitude. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused enormous psychological distress worldwide. Evidence-based strategies are needed to enhance well-being during this stressful time. This study attempted to fill these gaps by examining the benefits of feeling gratitude every day during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: A sample of 231 participants from mainland China aged 18 to 85 years participated in a 14-day daily diary study. After a pretest to collect demographic data, information on gratitude, daily positive and negative affect, perceived stress related to COVID-19, and subjective health were measured using daily questionnaires on 14 consecutive days. One month after the daily diary period, information on affective experiences, life satisfaction, and subjective health was collected as a follow-up survey. RESULTS: On days when individuals feel more gratitude than usual, they report more positive affect, a lower level of perceived stress related to COVID-19, and better subjective health on the concurrent day (Day N). Individuals also report a lower level of stress related to COVID-19 on the following day (Day N+1), when they feel more gratitude than usual on Day N. Higher levels of gratitude across the 14-day study period was associated with a higher level of positive affect and a lower level of negative affect, but was not associated with life satisfaction or subjective health at the one-month follow-up assessment. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate the benefits of gratitude in a naturalistic situation that induced stress and anxiety.","Jiang, Da",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284976/,333

This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature ≥37.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature ≥37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients.

We have now cloned several mouse Bgp cDNAs from an outbred CDR-1 mouse colon cDNA library, as well as by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of colon RNA. The distinguishing features of the deduced Bgp protein isoforms are found in the two divergent N-terminal domains, the highly conserved internal C2-set immunoglobulin domains, and an intracytoplasmic domain of either 10 or 73 amino acids (aa). The cDNA structures suggest that these mRNAs are produced through alternative splicing of a Bgp gene and the usage of multiple transcriptional terminators. The Bgp deduced aa sequences are highly homologous to several well characterized rat hepatocyte proteins such as the cell CAM105/ecto-ATPase/ppl20/HA4 proteins. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes representing the various cDNA isoform domains revealed predominant transcripts of 1.8, 3.1 and 4.0 kb on Northern analyses of mouse colon RNA; some of these bands are actually composed of several co-migrating transcripts. The transcripts encoding the long intracytoplasmic-tailed Bgp proteins are expressed at one-tenth the relative abundance of the shorter-tailed species. We have previously demonstrated that several mouse Bgp cDNAs, when transfected into eukaryotic cells, express BGP proteins at the cell surface and function in vitro as cell adhesion molecules, much like their human and rat counterparts. The expression of the many Bgp isoforms at the surface of epithelial cells, such as colon, suggests that these proteins play a determinant role, through self- or heterologous contact, in renewal and/or differentiation of their epithelia.","McCuaig, Kimberly; Rosenberg, Madelaine; Nédellec, Patrick; Turbide, Claire; Beauchemin, Nicole",Gene,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811199390716G; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8500759/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811199390716G,333

During the preweaning period, calves are susceptible to diarrhea that can lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality. Diarrhea has been related with a decrease of beneficial microbiota and an increase of coliform counts in feces. Prebiotic supplements are believed to decrease diarrhea and positively affect some parameters of the immune system. In calves, these supplements have shown some promising effects on intestinal microbial populations but there is limited information about effects on immunity. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of a prebiotic supplement containing fermentation products of lactic acid bacteria on the mucosal immune system by measuring fecal and salivary IgA and to evaluate calf health and growth performance. In this trial 40 Holstein calves were randomly assigned to receive milk replacer with a prebiotic supplement (20 g/day Prebio Support™; Meiji Feed Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) or the same milk replacer with no prebiotic (control). Fecal and salivary IgA, calf health, plasma IgG, and lymphocyte counts were not affected by treatment. Lactobacilli count in feces was higher (P = 0.05) and Bifidobacteria tended to be higher (P = 0.07) in calves fed prebiotic. Prebiotic supplement increased beneficial bacteria in calves, but did not decrease overall incidence of diarrhea in this trial. Calves in this study were all affected by cryptosporidiosis and some were treated with antibiotics, so it is possible that this limited some of the effects of the prebiotic product. Fecal IgA seemed to be a good measure of mucosal immunity, and more studies are needed to develop methods to measure this type of immunity in calves.","Quezada-Mendoza, V.C.; Heinrichs, A.J.; Jones, C.M.",Livest Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871141311002824; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141311002824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288870/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2011.07.015,333

Objective To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. Design, setting, and participants A total of 10 renal transplant recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this retrospective study. In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group. Intervention Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis. Results and limitations The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe/three critical cases vs one severe case). Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage. After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 ± 9.3 vs 12.2 ± 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 ± 8.3 vs 18.8 ± 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment. One patient developed acute renal graft failure and died of progressive respiratory failure. Conclusions Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding. Findings from this small group of cases may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations.

These characteristics are consistent with the multi-step model of disease. We applied this model to Covid-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) from China, South Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. In all countries we found that a plot of log(CFR) against log(age) was approximately linear with a slope of about 5. We also conducted similar analyses for selected other respiratory diseases. SARS showed a similar log–log age-pattern to that of Covid-19, albeit with a lower slope, whereas seasonal and pandemic influenza showed quite different age-patterns. Thus, death from Covid-19 and SARS appears to follow a distinct age-pattern, consistent with a multi-step model of disease that in the case of Covid-19 is probably defined by comorbidities and age producing immune-related susceptibility.

In the absence of efficient therapeutics or large-scale vaccination, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 governmental interventions published up to May 22, 2020, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states.

In China, plague is classified as category A, with highest risk and hazard among the infectious diseases. Qinghai used to be considered as one of the most serious areas of plague in China. In recent years, thanks to the measures in eight aspects summarized as the “Qinghai model” which were adopted to prevent and control the human plague in Qinghai, Qinghai has not experienced any plague case reported for eight years. In early 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbroke in China. The Qinghai model on plague was employed to deal with the COVID-19 emergency in Qinghai province. The Qinghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Qinghai CDC) and hospitals, along with the departments of public security, animal husbandry and other departments, quickly tracked and treated the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and started surveillance programs on close contacts timely. At present, the cure rate of patients has reached 100%, and close contacts have been effectively quarantined and tested to avoid the spread of COVID-19. The findings from the study suggest that the prevention and control measures undertaken in Qinghai province might be effective in dealing with the category A infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and other diseases.","Wu, Haisheng; Zhang, Qingwen; Wu, Hailian; Tian, Fuzhang; Cui, Baizhong; Qi, Zhizhen; Xu, Xiaoqing; Zhang, Xuefei; Wang, Hu",Biosaf Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2020.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053620300859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838287/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053620300859?v=s5,333

In this study, we tested the efficacy of a recombinant trimeric Spike protein containing polyI:C (PIKA) adjuvant in mice immunized by a 0–7–14 day schedule. The results showed that a Spike protein-specific antibody was induced at Day 21 with titer of above 50,000 on average, as measured by direct binding. The neutralizing titer was above 1000 on average, as determined by a pseudo-virus using monoclonal antibodies (40592-MM57 and 40591-MM43) with IC50 at 1 μg/mL as standards. The protein/peptide array-identified receptor-binding domain (RBD) was considered as immunodominant. No linear epitopes were found in the RBD, although several linear epitopes were found in the C-terminal domain right after the RBD and heptad repeat regions.

The paper examines the impact of government restrictive measures on the spread and effects of COVID-19. The work is devoted to the improvement of recommendation rules based on novel ensemble of machine learning methods such as regression tree and clustering. The dynamics of migration between countries in clusters, and their relationship with the number of confirmed cases and the percentage of deaths caused by COVID-19, were studied on the example of Poland, Italy and Germany. It is shown that there is a clear relationship between the cluster number and the number of new cases of diseases and death. It has also been shown that different countries' policies to prevent the disease, in particular the timing of restrictive measures, correlate with the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 and the consequences of the disease. For example, the results show a clear proactive tactic of restrictive measures by example of Germany, and catching up on the spread of the disease by example of Italy. A regression tree and guidelines about influence of features on the spreading of COVID-19 and mortality due to this infection have been constructed. The paper predicts the number of deaths due to COVID-19 on a 21-day interval using the obtained guidelines on the example of Sweden. Such forecasting was carried out for two potential government action options: with existing precautionary actions and the same precautionary actions, if they had been taken 20 days earlier (following the example of Germany). The RMSE of the mortality forecast does not exceed 4.2, which shows a good prognostic ability of the developed model. At the same time, the simulation based on the strategy of anticipatory introduction of restrictions gives 2-6% lower values of the forecast of the number of new cases. Thus, the results of this study provide an opportunity to assess the impact of decisions about restrictive measures and predict, simulate the consequences of restrictions policy.","Yakovyna, Vitaliy; Shakhovska, Natalya",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33892572/; https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2021142,333

PRP can be associated with infection, autoimmunity, drugs and malignancies, and can be idiopathic. OBJECTIVE: PRP following vaccination has been rarely described in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of PRP two weeks following COVID-19 vaccination (Covishield). CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old male presented to the outpatient dermatology department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences - Bhopal with minimally pruritic superficial plaques since one week. The patient was vaccinated against COVID-19 with Covishield two weeks earlier. The lesions developed as erythematous scaly follicular papules and plaques over axilla that rapidly spread to the trunk in the following weeks and involved palms and soles as well as thickening and fissuring. The clinical features suggested PRP. The histopathology showed epidermal acanthosis with hypergranulosis alternating with parakeratosis and orthokeratosis with broad rete ridges with follicular plugging. The patient had started taking topical corticosteroids and emollients, which proved effective. There was no recurrence after receiving a second dose on follow-up. CONCLUSION: In patients presenting with new onset PRP in this COVID-19 era, the possibility of vaccine as a trigger should be taken into consideration, and further dosing should be carefully monitored in view of possible recurrence.","Sahni, Mukesh Kumar; Roy, Kanika; Asati, Dinesh Prasad; Khurana, Ujjawal",Int. j. risk saf. med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420983/; https://doi.org/10.3233/jrs-210048,333

Understanding the factors that affect youth who exhibit bullying behaviors is equally important. Such knowledge can heighten effectiveness of prevention and interventions at the individual, family, school, and community levels. We performed a secondary data analysis using data from the 2009 to 2010 World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) Health Behavior in School-Aged Children cross-sectional survey (n = 12,642), the most recent WHO data collected in the USA. Using latent class analysis, we clustered sample participants into categories of children who do not bully, bully with a low cyberbullying element, bully with a moderate cyberbullying element, and bully with a high cyberbullying element. We used multinomial logistic regression to explore the relationships between youth’s perception of certain family characteristics (e.g., parental emotional support and socio-demographic characteristics) and the odds ratios of falling into one of the four latent classes generated. Establishing if a relationship exists between youth’s perception of parental support factors and their bullying behavior can enhance understanding of variables that might modify adolescents’ bullying. Findings of this study point to the importance of parental emotional support as a factor that can affect adolescent cyberbullying behavior.

This analysis examined whether teachers and other school workers are at higher risk of head/chest cold compared to all other workers in the United States. METHODS: Seven years (1998‐2004) of National Health Interview Survey data on currently employed workers were combined to provide a basis for estimating the incidence proportion of head/chest cold. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for head/chest cold was significantly elevated for teachers and other workers employed at schools compared to all other workers. When examined by month, an excess of increased head/chest cold risk during the school year suggested that a portion of head/chest cold among teachers and other school workers is attributable to their workplace, perhaps due to close contact with students at school. CONCLUSION: Head/chest cold, a surrogate for acute respiratory infection, was more common among school workers during the school year and less common during July than for all other workers in the United States. Targeted training for school workers and students may be beneficial to reduce work‐related exposure to viruses and bacteria that infect the respiratory system.","Tak, SangWoo; Groenewold, Matthew; Alterman, Toni; Park, Robert M.; Calvert, Geoffrey M.",J Sch Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21831069/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1746-1561.2011.00627.x,333
606213,Rehabilitation Medicine Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-18,"OBJECTIVES: To mitigate risk of mortality from coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19), the UK government recommended ‘shielding’ of vulnerable people through self-isolation for 12 weeks. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using a nationally representative English primary care database comparing people aged >=40years who were recorded as being advised to shield using a fixed ratio of 1:1, matching to people with the same diagnoses not advised to shield (n=77,360 per group). Time-to-death was compared using Cox regression, reporting the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality between groups. A sensitivity analysis compared exact matched cohorts (n=24,752 shielded, n=61,566 exact matches). RESULTS: We found a time-varying HR of mortality between groups. In the first 21 days, the mortality risk in people shielding was half those not (HR=0.50, 95%CI:0.41-0.59. p<0.0001). Over the remaining nine weeks, mortality risk was 54% higher in the shielded group (HR=1.54, 95%CI:1.41-1.70, p<0.0001). Beyond the shielding period, mortality risk was over two-and-a-half times higher in the shielded group (HR=2.61, 95%CI:2.38-2.87, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Shielding halved the risk of mortality for 21 days. Mortality risk became higher across the remainder of the shielding period, rising to two-and-a-half times greater post-shielding. Shielding may be beneficial in the next wave of COVID-19.","Zarif, Azmaeen; Joy, Mark; Sherlock, Julian; Sheppard, James P; Byford, Rachel; Akinyemi, Oluwafunmi; Bankhead, Clare R; Deeks, Alexandra; Ferreira, Filipa; Jones, Nicholas; Liyanage, Harshana; McGagh, Dylan; Nicholson, Brian; Oke, Jason; Okusi, Cecilia; Tripathy, Manasa; Williams, John; Hobbs, Richard; de Lusignan, Simon",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445321002206?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2021.04.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004222/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445321002206,333

Due to the lack of drugs and prophylaxis against COVID-19, most of the countries are now relying on preventive measures focusing on maintaining social distance. However, this social distancing can create global socio-economic threats and psychological disorders. Therefore, these control measures need to have an assessment to evaluate their potential in containing the situation. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to control measures, health care facilities, and prevalent diseases. Based on our findings, the number of COVID-19 deaths found to reduce with increased medical personnel and hospital beds. We found 0.23, 0.16, and 0.21 as the measurement of non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians, nurses and midwives, and hospital beds and these relationships are highly significant with p-value of 0.000007, 0.0046, and 0.0196, respectively. Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between the reduction of COVID-19 cases and the earliness of preventive initiation. As a result, enhancing health care facilities as well as imposing those control measures in a short time could be valuable to prevent the currently raging COVID-19 pandemic. The apathy of taking immediate health care action from the nations has identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worst. Gambia, Nicaragua, Burundi, Namibia, and Nepal have marked in a state of danger based on the comparative study towards the health care action for the top twenty burdening and least affected countries. Interestingly, no association in most diseases except for few cases has found between the comorbidities and severity of COVID-19, which warranted further investigation at the pathobiological level.

The aim of this study is to assess the awareness of COVID-19 disease and related infection control practices among healthcare professionals and students in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Materials and methods A total of 1562 responders from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region completed a questionnaire-based survey on the awareness, knowledge, and infection control practices related to COVID-19 infection in the healthcare setting. The questionnaire was adapted from the current interim guidance and information for healthcare workers published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Convenient sampling method was used for data collection and the distribution of responses was presented as frequencies and percentages. Descriptive statistics were performed for all groups and subgroups based on the percentage of correct responses. Individual pairwise comparisons were done using the median test for the percentage of correct responses. Results The overall awareness for all subgroups was adequate with 71.2% reporting correct answers. The highest percentage of correct responses were from undergraduate medical students and the lowest was from non-clinical/administrative staff. Less than half of the total respondents could correctly define “close contact.” More than three-fourths of the responders were aware of the various infection control measures like rapid triage, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette and having a separate, well ventilated waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients. However, only 45.4% of the responders were aware of the correct sequence for the application of a mask/respirator, and only 52.5% of the responders were aware of the preferred hand hygiene method for visibly soiled hands. Conclusion There is a need for regular educational interventions and training programs on infection control practices for COVID-19 across all healthcare professions. Occupational health and safety are of paramount importance to minimize the risk of transmission to healthcare students and professionals and provide optimal care for patients.","Modi, Pranav D; Nair, Girija; Uppe, Abhay; Modi, Janhavi; Tuppekar, Balaji; Gharpure, Amit S; Langade, Deepak",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377462/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7514,333

This has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which most laboratory exercises have been conducted as a simulation. Simulated experiments provide a stopgap for certain courses, but for upper-level and research courses, they are often insufficient. Many new microscopy tools now on the market can be adapted to allow students to generate and analyze novel data with little aid from instructors. Remote brightfield-based systems like the CytoSMART Lux2 can be used to gather real-time insight into the progression of cell growth, cell migration, and cell viability over time. The data from these systems can be viewed via the Internet or downloaded for later analysis. Confocal microscopy also offers unique remote-learning opportunities. Because these fluorescence-based microscopes are controlled almost exclusively by a computer, free “remote desktop” software can allow students to learn how to use this cutting-edge technology and can also allow for the generation and analysis of novel data. While these systems can be expensive, they offer a variety of benefits for undergraduate students and researchers, whether they are in the laboratory or working remotely.","Thompson, Christopher R.",J Microbiol Biol Educ,https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884092/,333

Many have speculated that, like SARS, the activity of SARS-CoV-2 will subside when the climate becomes warmer. We sought to determine the relationship between ambient temperature and COVID-19 incidence in Canada. We analyzed over 77,700 COVID-19 cases from four Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec) from January to May 2020. After adjusting for precipitation, wind gust speed, and province in multiple linear regression models, we found a positive, but not statistically significant, association between cumulative incidence and ambient temperature (14.2 per 100,000 people; 95%CI: −0.60–29.0). We also did not find a statistically significant association between total cases or effective reproductive number of COVID-19 and ambient temperature. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that higher temperatures will reduce transmission of COVID-19 and warns the public not to lose vigilance, and to continue practicing safety measures such as hand washing, social distancing, and use of facial masks despite the warming climates.","To, Teresa; Zhang, Kimball; Maguire, Bryan; Terebessy, Emilie; Fong, Ivy; Parikh, Supriya; Zhu, Jingqin",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720350130?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720350130; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32829260/,333

It has been introduced as a famine-resilience crop and has become a cultural diet. However, little is known about its culinary and nutritional properties. This study aimed to explore the cooking and nutritional properties of Zamnè (Senegalia macrostachya (Reichenb. ex DC.) Kyal. & Boatwr.). Zamnè presented characteristics of medium size, flattened, dry, and hard-to-cook legume. The moisture, cylindrical ratio, diameter, thickness, weight, true density, coat percentage, coat thickness, and cooking time of the seeds were in the range of 4.5-5.8 %, 1.1, 7.4-8.0 mm, 1.6-1.8 mm, 65.0-76.4 mg, 1.1 g/ml, 16.8-22.2 %, 9.0-11.9, and 180 minutes, respectively.

Nine viral-induced intracellular glycoproteins were first detected from as early as 2 hr postinoculation (67K, early phase) to as late as 14 hr (36K and 19K glycoproteins, intermediate phase). Glycosylation of these proteins was observed to continue to the end of the experiment (28 hr postinoculation). Seven of these intracellular glycoproteins could also be detected in infected Trichoplusia ni TN-368 cells 24 hr postinoculation. When the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin was present (from 0 hr postinoculation) there was no detectable glycosylation of any of these viral-induced glycoproteins. Metabolic labeling of the nonoccluded virus budded from IPLB-21 and TN-368 with tritiated mannose or N-acetylglucosamine identified 11 structural glycoproteins, 8 of which were identical in both virus preparations. All of these structural glycoproteins were sensitive to the inhibitory action of tunicamycin. A single 42K structural glycoprotein was detected (with acetylglucosamine only) in the occluded form of AcNPV. Glycosylation of this structural protein appeared to be insensitive to tunicamycin. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination was used to determine which of the virus structural glycoproteins are exposed on the virion surface.","Stiles, Brad; Wood, H.

610415,Effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Northern Italy: Perspectives from the Bergamo Neurosurgery Department,2020-04-02,"Objective To investigate the intention of the Hong Kong general population to take up vaccination against influenza A/H1N1. Setting Cross sectional population based anonymous survey. Participants Random sample of 301 adults interviewed by telephone (response rate 80%). Main outcome measure Intention to take up vaccination against influenza A/H1N1 under five hypothetical scenarios: vaccination is free; vaccination per dosage costs less than $HK100 (£8; €9; $13), $HK101-200, or more than $HK200; and no data are available on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Results 45% (n=135) of the participants reported that they would be highly likely take up vaccination if it was free. When vaccination incurred a cost, however, the prevalence of uptake decreased: 36% (n=108) would take up vaccination if it cost less than $HK100, 24% (n=72) if it cost $HK101-200, and 15% (n=45) if it cost more than $HK200; and in absence of proved efficacy and safety decreased to 5% (n=14). Moreover, 32% (n=95) considered universal A/H1N1 vaccination unnecessary. Overall, 39% (n=117) of participants believed that A/H1N1 vaccination would prevent the virus being contracted; 63% (n=189) erroneously believed that efficacy of the vaccine had been confirmed by clinical trials, and 16% (n=49) believed that it is necessary for everyone in Hong Kong to take up vaccination against influenza A/H1N1. Conclusions The uptake of vaccination against influenza A/H1N1 by the general population of Hong Kong is unlikely to be high and would be sensitive to personal cost. Evidence about safety and efficacy is critical in determining the prevalence of uptake of vaccination.","Lau, Joseph T F; Yeung, Nelson C Y; Choi, K C; Cheng, Mabel Y M; Tsui, H Y; Griffiths, Sian",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19861377/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b4164,333
610525,Can rituximab be used in the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris during the COVID‐19 pandemic?,2020-12-15,"The total number of inhabitants on the Earth is estimated to cross a record number of 9 × 10(3) million by 2050 that present a unique challenge to provide energy and clean environment to every individual. The growth in population results in a change of land use, and greenhouse gas emission due to increased industrialization and transportation. Energy consumption affects the quality of the environment by adding carbon dioxide and other pollutants to the atmosphere. This leads to oceanic acidification and other environmental fluctuations due to global climate change. Concurrently, speedy utilization of known conventional fuel reservoirs causes a challenge to a sustainable supply of energy. Therefore, an alternate energy resource is required that can maintain the sustainability of energy and environment. Among different alternatives, energy production from high carbon dioxide capturing photosynthetic aquatic microbes is an emerging technology to clean environment and produce carbon-neutral energy from their hydrocarbon-rich biomass. However, economical challenges due to low biomass production still prevent the commercialization of bioenergy. In this work, we review the impact of fossil fuels burning, which is predominantly used to fulfill global energy demand, on the quality of the environment. We also assess the status of biofuel production and utilization and discuss its potential to clean the environment. The complications associated with biofuel manufacturing using photosynthetic microorganisms are discussed and directed evolution for targeted phenotypes and targeted delivery of nutrients are proposed as potential strategies to increase the biomass production.","Maurya, Pankaj Kumar; Mondal, Soumila; Kumar, Vinod; Singh, Shailendra Pratap",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15540-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322801/,333
610565,Impact of COVID-19 on operative experience of junior surgical trainees,2020-12-26,"North America is experiencing an unprecedented overdose crisis driven by the proliferation of fentanyl and its analogues in the illicit drug supply. In 2018 there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the United States, and since 2016, there have been more than 14,700 overdose deaths in Canada, with most related to fentanyl. Despite concerted efforts and some positive progress, current public health, substance use treatment, and harm reduction interventions (such as widespread naloxone distribution and implementation of supervised consumption sites) have not been able to rapidly decrease overdose fatalities. In view of the persistent gaps in services and the limitations of available options, immediate scale-up of low-barrier opioid distribution programs are urgently needed. This includes “off-label” prescription of pharmaceutical grade opioids (e.g., hydromorphone) to disrupt the toxic drug supply and make safer opioids widely available to people at high risk of fatal overdose.","Ivsins, Andrew; Boyd, Jade; Beletsky, Leo; McNeil, Ryan",Int J Drug Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102769; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0955395920301109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32446183/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395920301109,333

Base immunisation is redefined: it is complete only after the multivalent booster in the second year of life. A yearly revaccination interview, not necessarily an injection, should become the new standard. This interview is a professional service that must be taught, expertly performed and invoiced. Adult animals should be “vaccinated to measure”, taking age, breed, lifestyle, the epidemiologic situation, etc. into account. Post-vaccination serology should become a guide in revaccination decisions. For a solid herd immunity, more animals of the population must be vaccinated.

PURPOSE: The study compares SARS knowledge, perceptions, behaviors, and information between Finns and the Dutch during the SARS outbreak in 2003. METHOD: The participants of the study, who used a modified SARS Psychosocial Research Consortium survey, were drawn from Internet panels in Finland (n = 308) and the Netherlands (n = 373) in June 2003. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) to compare Finns with the Dutch for various levels of perceptions and behaviors. RESULTS: Adjusted for age, education, and income, Finns were more likely to be knowledgeable and worried about SARS as well as to have low perceived comparative SARS risk and poor personal efficacy beliefs about preventing SARS. Finns were also more likely than the Dutch to have high confidence in physicians on SARS issues but less likely to have received information from the Internet and have confidence in Internet information. CONCLUSIONS: The study shed light on how two European populations differed substantially regarding lay responses to SARS. Understanding these differences is needed in formulating and executing communication and outbreak management.","Vartti, A.-M.; Oenema, A.; Schreck, M.; Uutela, A.; de Zwart, O.; Brug, J.; Aro, A.

613983,Detection of COVID-19 RNA: Looking beyond PCR,2020-11-26,"Abstract C57BI/6, but not BALB/c, mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM) develop a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis. In this report, we characterized anti-viral cytotoxic T cells in the central nervous system and spleen during the acute and chronic stages of the MHV infection. The data show that C57BI/6 mice display a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response to the surface (S) glycoprotein and this response can be demonstrated in lymphocytes isolated from the brains and spinal cords of mice both acutely and persistently infected with MHV-JHM. Thus, the anti-S CTL activity present in the central nervous system of chronically infected animals is not sufficient to prevent the demyelinating process. BALB/c mice have been shown previously to mount a CTL response against the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Stohlman et al., 1992). Since C57BI/6 mice do not mount a response to the N protein, the role of the N-specific response in preventing the late onset disease was assessed using B10.A(18R) mice, recombinant in the H-2 locus. These mice contain the d alleles of the D and L loci and exhibit a CTL response against the N protein. However, unlike the BALB/c mice, these animals develop the late onset symptomatic disease. These results suggest that the N-specific response is partially protective against the development of the demyelinating disease, but that additional factors are also likely to be involved.","Castro, Raymond F.; Evans, Gregory D.; Jaszewski, Andrew; Perlman, Stanley",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8178457/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682284712372; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682284712372,333

Epilepsy is the most common neurological disease in childhood and adolescence. The aim of this study was to determine anxiety levels among the mothers of children under follow-up for epilepsy in our clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study group consisted of the mothers of epilepsy patients who were under follow-up in the pediatric neurology outpatient clinic of the tertiary care center and were scheduled for a routine examination during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mothers' anxiety levels according to the Beck Anxiety Inventory and their opinions about COVID-19 in relation to their child were assessed and compared based on whether the mother/patient attended their appointments in person and whether the child had frequent or infrequent seizures. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety level between the mothers of 64 children with epilepsy who attended their appointment during the pandemic and those of the mothers of 52 who did not attend their appointment. However, the mothers of children with frequent seizures had significantly higher anxiety levels. CONCLUSION: Anxiety level of mothers whose children have frequent seizures was significantly higher compared to mothers whose children have infrequent seizures. It is important to be aware about this point and using telemedicine approach in suitable population and postpone routine outpatient follow-up appointments as much as possible.","Celik, Halil; Acikel, Sadettin Burak; Ozdemir, Fatih Mehmet Akif; Aksoy, Erhan; Oztoprak, Ulkuhan; Cucu, Ergin; Kucur, Ozge; Ceylan, Nesrin; Yuksel, Deniz",Eur Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853068/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000514826,333
615359,A scoping review of the Clinical Frailty Scale,2020-10-07,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: To estimate long-term effects of COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: A telephone/online survey of COVID-19 patients with rheumatic diseases has been conducted to detect lung and other organ damage 40 days or more after the coronavirus infection. The inclusion criterion was the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or hospitalization in COVID-19 hospitals. Out of 42 patients interviewed 25 had ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), 10 - systemic sclerosis, 5 – rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 1 – systemic lupus erythematosus and 1– giant cell arteritis. Additional examination was carried out when necessary: chest computed tomography (CT);examination of blood serum (CRP, ANCA, ANA, RF, biochemical tests);cerebrospinal fluid analysis;clinical analysis of blood and urine. RESULTS: Long-term complications of COVID-19 after 40 or more days have been detected in 8 patients;seven of them had AAV (4- granulomatosis with polyangiitis, GPA;2- eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EGPA;1- microscopic polyangiitis, MPA) and one - RA. Six patients were examined in a hospital. In four patients with AAV long-term consequences of COVID-19 included lung involvement (CT 25-75% of lung involvement, noted 70-150 days after acute COVID-19, 4/4 - ground-glass opacity, 2/4 - fibrosis), in one patient with MPA - Guillain–Barré syndrome and ground-glass opacity on chest CT with 45% of lung involvement (42 days after COVID-19), in one patient with GPA - severe dermatitis (60 days after COVID-19), in one patient with RA - headache (30 days and more after COVID-19). Three AAV patients had myalgias. Sudden death occurred 6 months later in the patient with GPA without a history of heart disease. In all cases other infections were excluded, and there was no detected activity of the main disease. All AAV patients had rituximab-induced remission. In two EGPA patients hypersensitivity pneumonitis development cannot be excluded, considering the polypharmacy (analgesics, antibacterial and antifungal agents). CONCLUSIONS: The results may suggests the existence of the synergy of the pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 and autoimmune rheumatic diseases (primarily AAV), which can lead to the development of long-term consequences of COVID-19. In modern understanding, the mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 are immune disorders with the development of occlusive microangiopathy (immunothrombosis), together with high inflammatory activity. The complications of COVID-19 have developed primarily in patients with AAV, which is characterized by damage to small vessels, the mechanisms of AAV and severe COVID-19 are similar. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It seems evident that patients with rheumatic diseases after COVID-19 (or after coronavirus vaccination) need long-term monitoring.

The present study provides a cross-sectional observational study on 134 hospitalized patients selected from Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) using cluster sampling. A total of 68 patients had reduced red blood cell (RBC) counts, 55 a decrease in the hemoglobin concentration (HBC) and 73 a decline in hematocrit (HCT). The false-negative rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in pharyngeal swab specimens was 18.7%. The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), RBC, HBC and HCT levels in false-negative patients were significantly higher than those in patients who tested positive for viral nucleic acids. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that RBC [odds ratio (OR)=0.43, 95% CI: 0.18-0.99], HBC (OR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99) and ALC (OR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.20-0.91) were the factors influencing the negative testing results for viral nucleic acid. The rate of re-positive patients was 16.4%. The white blood cell, RBC, HBC and HCT values in re-positive patients were lower than those in non-re-positive patients. The median (interquartile range) values for RBC, HBC and HCT of male re-positive patients were 3.95 (3.37, 4.2) x10(12)/l, 123 (103, 133) g/l and 36.6 (31.1, 39.2)%, respectively, while the RBC, HBC and HCT of female re-positive patients were 3.54 (3.13, 3.74) x10(12)/l, 115 (102, 118) g/l and 34.2 (28.5, 34.9)%, respectively. It was determined that RBC, HBC and HCT values had moderate accuracy in predicting SARS-CoV-2 recurrence in patients with COVID-19 using receiver operating curve analysis.

It has resulted in great health and economic costs because no effective treatment is currently available. Since infected persons vary in presentation from healthy asymptomatic mild symptoms to those who need intensive care support and eventually succumb to the disease, this illness is considered to depend primarily on individual immunity. Demographic distribution and disease severity in several regions of the world vary; therefore, it is believed that natural inherent immunity provided through dietary sources and traditional medicines could play an important role in infection prevention and disease progression. People can boost their immunity to prevent them from infection after COVID-19 exposure and can reduce their inflammatory reactions to protect their organ deterioration in case suffering from the disease. Some drugs with in-situ immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activity are also identified as adjunctive therapy in the COVID-19 era. This review discusses the importance of COVID-19 interactions with immune cells and inflammatory cells; and further emphasizes the possible pathways related with traditional herbs, medications and nutritional products.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study. METHODS: In this single-centre study involving patients diagnosed with glaucoma, the perimetric outcomes of MRF were compared against those returned from the HFA 24-2 SITA standard. Outcomes included mean deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD), visual field index (VFI)/visual capacity (VC), foveal threshold, test time, number of points depressed at P < 5% on PSD probability plot, and glaucoma hemifield test/color coded indicator. RESULTS: The study included 28 eyes of 28 glaucoma patients. Mean (standard deviation) test times were 342.07 (56.70) seconds for MRF and 375.11 (88.95) for HFA 24-2 SITA standard (P=0.046). Mean MD was significantly lower for MRF (Δ = 3.09, P < 0.001), and mean PSD was significantly higher for MRF (Δ = 1.40, P=0.005) compared with HFA. The mean foveal threshold for the MRF was significantly lower than the mean HFA foveal threshold ((Δ = 9.25, P < 0.001). The number of points depressed at P < 5% on the PSD probability plot was significantly less for MRF (P < 0.001). Other perimetric outcomes showed no significant differences between both. Bland–Altman plots showed that considerable variability existed between the programs.

METHODS: Subjects with a previous diagnosis of DED. Their OSDI scores were compared with those recorded in Fall 2019 using the Wilcoxon paired test. Participants were stratified by face mask use: heavy (Group A) or standard (Group B) face mask users. Heavy use was defined as wearing any type of face mask for at least 6 hours a day, at least 5 days per week in the last 2 months. RESULTS: 67 subjects (mean age: 45.27 ± 10.06 SD years, 40% males and 60% females). Median OSDI score in Fall 2019: 18.75. Median OSDI in Spring 2020: 20.83. The Hodges-Lehmann median difference was 2.09 (95% CI [1.05, 4.17]) (P < 0.0001). The population was then stratified into heavy and standard face mask users: Group A included heavy users (31 subjects; mean age: 42.81 ± 10.48 SD years; 35% males and 65% females), Group B included standard users (36 subjects; mean age: 47.39 ± 9.31 SD years; 44% males and 56% females). The Hodges-Lehmann median difference was 5.21 (95% CI [3.13, 7.29]) in Group A (P < 0.0001), and 1.04 (95% [0, 2.08]) in Group B (P = 0.0177). CONCLUSION: Prolonged and consistent face mask use is associated with an increase in OSDI scores.

Methods: Single-center, quadruple-blinded RCT. Symptomatic Covid 19 outpatients (aged 18 to 60 years) with positive SARS-CoV2 nucleic acids test were randomized to active (n=150; [≥]2x109 colony-forming units (CFU) of probiotic strains Lactiplantibacillus plantarum KABP022, KABP023 and KAPB033, plus strain Pediococcus acidilactici KABP021) or placebo (n=150), take orally once daily for 30 days. Oral acetaminophen was allowed and controlled as co-intervention. Primary endpoint included: i) proportion of patients in complete remission (both symptoms and nucleic acids test) or progressing to moderate or severe disease with hospitalization; ii) death rate and duration on Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Safety was assessed in all patients. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04517422). Findings: 300 subjects were randomized (median age 37.0 years [range 18 to 60], 161 [53.7%] women, 126 [42.0%] having known metabolic risk factors), and 293 completed the study (97.7%).

622773,The Phone: Communication in the Age of COVID-19,2021-02-08,"The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought significant pressure on nurses globally as they are the frontline of care. This study aimed to explore the experiences and challenges of nurses who worked with hospitalised patients with COVID-19. In this qualitative study, a purposive sample of 14 nurses participated in in-depth telephone interviews. Data were analysed using Colaizzi’s phenomenological method. Five key themes emerged: (1) physical and psychological distress of nurses, (2) willingness to work, (3) the essential role of support mechanisms, (4) educational and informational needs of nurses and (5) the role of modern technology in COVID-19 care. Although the provision of care led to physical and psychological distress among nurses, with their commitment and professional obligation, it is a new experience that leads to personal satisfaction. Guilty feeling related to inefficiency of care, witnessing the suffering of patients, discomfort associated with wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), work-related issues (e.g., long hour shifts), negative impact to the family and rejection by others are the leading distress factors. Religious beliefs, including keeping trust in good and bad merits, have become a strong coping mechanism. Addressing distress among nurses is essential. The reported learning needs of nurses included skills related to donning and doffing PPE, skills in performing nursing procedures and breaking bad news. Nurse managers need to pay special attention to expanding training opportunities as well as support mechanisms, for example, welfare, appreciations and counselling services for nurses. Modern technology, particularly robots and telecommunication, can perform an essential role in COVID-19 care. The establishment of timely policies and strategies to protect health workers during a national disaster like COVID-19 is needed.","Rathnayake, Sarath; Dasanayake, Damayanthi; Maithreepala, Sujeewa Dilhani; Ekanayake, Ramya; Basnayake, Pradeepa Lakmali",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34478482/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257064,333
623371,The Darkest Day of the Year: A New Year's Letter to Our Palliative Care Fellows,2021,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound is a diagnostic adjunct in the management of respiratory diseases. We describe the clinical progress and lung ultrasound findings of a Singaporean COVID-19 intensive care unit patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The clinical course of one COVID-19 patient managed in the intensive care unit was traced. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 virus infection and intubated after developing respiratory failure. Serial point-of-care bedside lung ultrasound was performed by the managing intensivist daily, and correlated with the clinical progress and chest X-ray imaging done for the patient. RESULTS: The patient exhibited lung ultrasound findings consistent with that described for viral pneumonias. This included numerous B-lines and subpleural consolidations with disrupted pleural lines distributed symmetrically, predominantly in bilateral upper BLUE points, and lower BLUE points bilaterally. Coalescing B-lines leading on to the development of bilateral “white lung” were associated with worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome. An increased density or reduction of the B-lines was associated with clinical improvement or deterioration, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Trained clinicians, who are familiar with point-of-care lung ultrasonography, may consider point-of-care bedside ultrasound as an important adjunct to history and physical examination for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 when advanced imaging is not available because of logistical reasons or infectious control. This applies in particular to cases where resources are limited, and patient transfers to facilities offering such services may prove hazardous.","Peh, Wee Ming; Chan, Steffi Kang Ting; Lee, Yi Lin; Gare, Pravin Shivaji; Ho, Vui Kian",J Ultrason,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609971/; https://doi.org/10.15557/jou.2020.0025,333

623467,E-Health Practices and Technologies: A Systematic Review from 2014 to 2019,2021-09-10,"BACKGROUND: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires high influenza vaccination rates for the chronically ill in order to avoid additional strain on the health care system. Despite clear evidence of the safety and effectiveness of influenza vaccination, vaccination coverage has internationally remained at inadequate levels in recent years. The general practitioner is of central importance for the care of this population. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate various measures in general practice to increase seasonal influenza vaccination rates for the chronically ill, taking into account various international health systems. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and ERIC as well as manually in trial registers and literature lists. Only randomized controlled studies were taken into account. The methodology was defined in advance in a study protocol and published (PROSPERO CRD42018114163). RESULTS: A total of 14 studies within the framework of a national health service (United Kingdom), a state (Australia) and social (Switzerland) health insurance system and a private health care system (USA) were included in our review. Analog patient reminders and automated physician reminders as well as changes in professional roles have led to a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates, but only in the private health care system. In the national health service, none of the interventions we analyzed achieved a significant increase in vaccination rates, although the National Health Service in the United Kingdom documented relatively good basic influenza vaccination rates before the studies were carried out, regardless of the intervention. Good results were achieved in the social and state health insurance systems of Switzerland and Australia by training events for practice teams and SMS reminders. CONCLUSIONS: In Germany, training events for medical teams and centrally organized invitation and monitoring systems might improve vaccination rates among the chronically ill. That the federal government pays for the vaccination costs seems to ensure a good basic influenza vaccination coverage for indicated patients in various health systems.","Brombacher, Felix; Sanftenberg, Linda; Klug, Stefanie J.; Schelling, Jörg; Gensichen, Jochen",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33640286/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1865921721000271; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2021.01.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1865921721000271,333

A number of in vitro as well as in vivo model animal studies have shown that widely used compound hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is able to cause anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2. While there is no enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have already approved HCQ as treatment and prophylactic option. In the current study we analyzed the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantity change in nasopharynx swabs of infected patients in mild condition and compared that of patients receiving HCQ and receiving no antiviral pharmacological therapy. We found that most of the patients demonstrated gradual decrease in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the swab regardless of the HCQ receiving. Noteworthy that patients with RNA load higher than 106 copies were hospitalized due to condition deteriorating significantly more frequently compared to those with RNA load below 106 copies even with HCQ administration. In addition, the results of the current study indicate that recovering patients may produce viruses at least during 18 days from the onset of symptoms and HCQ therapy does not block or reduce it.","Komissarov, A.; Molodtsov, I.; Ivanova, O.; Maryukhnich, E.; Kudryavtseva, S.; Mazus, A.; Nikonov, E.; Vasilieva, E.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143289; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.30.20143289v1?rss=1,333

Most recently SARS-CoV-2 virus (causing COVID-19) has led to a pandemic with no successful therapeutics. The SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on trimeric spike (S) proteins to facilitate virus entry into host cells by binding to ACE2 receptor on host cell membranes. Therefore, blocking this interaction with antibodies are promising agents against SARS-CoV-2. Here we describe using humanized llama antibody VHHs against SARS-CoV-2 that would overcome the limitations associated with polyclonal and monoclonal combination therapies. From two llama VHH libraries, unique humanized VHHs that bind to S protein and block the S/ACE2 interaction were identified. Furthermore, pairwise combination of VHHs showed synergistic blocking. Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains. Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD – 0.25 nM, IC100 ∼ 36.7 nM, IC95 ∼ 12.2 nM, IC50 ∼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs. Overall, this design would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2.

Activated neutrophils also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to a variety of stimuli. These NETs are net-like complexes composed of cell-free DNA, histones and neutrophil granule proteins. Besides the evolutionarily conserved mechanism to capture and eliminate pathogens, NETs are also associated with pathophysiological processes of various diseases. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms of NET formation and their different implications in disease. We focused on autoinflammatory and cardiovascular disorders as the leading cause of death. Neutrophil extracellular traps are not only present in various cardiovascular diseases but play an essential role in atherosclerotic plaque formation, arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, NETosis can be considered as a source of autoantigens and maintains an inflammatory milieu promoting autoimmune diseases. Indeed, there is further need for research into the balance between NET induction, inhibition, and degradation in order to pharmacologically target NETs and their compounds without impairing the patient’s immune defense. This review may be of interest to both basic scientists and clinicians to stimulate translational research and innovative clinical approaches.","Klopf, Johannes; Brostjan, Christine; Eilenberg, Wolf; Neumayer, Christoph",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33429925/,333

At present, there are no specifically approved therapeutic agents or vaccines for its treatment. Previous studies have shown that the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is effective in patients with COVID-19. However, its efficacy in patients with persistently positive nucleic acid test is unknown. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we present the clinical data of 5 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted, between January 16 and February 26, 2020, in intensive care unit of Xiaogan Central Hospital. DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTIONS: All these patients had a persistently positive nucleic acid test and received CPT. All 5 patients had severe respiratory failure, and thus, required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median time from the onset of symptoms to initiating the CPT was 37 (Interquartile range, 34-44) days. OUTCOMES: Only 2 patients were cured and subsequently discharged, while 3 patients succumbed due to multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: The time of initiating the CPT may be an important factor affecting its efficacy, and its therapeutic effect in the treatment of COVID-19, in the late stage, is limited.","Wang, Min; Yang, Xiaohong; Yang, Fang; Zhu, Xinxin; Sun, Zhibing; Bao, Peiling; Yan, Yimin",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000021596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32898996/,333
626459,Toward Understanding COVID-19 Recovery: National Institutes of Health Workshop on Postacute COVID-19,2021-03-30,"Abstract Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, and whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.","Scheen, André J.; Marre, Michel; Thivolet, Charles",Diabetes Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447101/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363620300859?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363620300859; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabet.2020.05.008,333

AREAS COVERED: Herein, we discuss the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of antiviral agents employed over the past months for the treatment of COVID-19, and the reasons to be considered for antiviral selection. EXPERT OPINION: The available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) currently discourages the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferons, which did not show improved efficacy compared to standard care or placebo. Regarding remdesivir, the current body of evidence may conditionally support its use in COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen supplementation but still not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Finally, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been proven efficacious in reducing the risk of severe disease development if administered early in the course of the disease to patients at risk of progression. The results of the ongoing RCT will certainly be crucial to further improve our understanding of the optimal place in therapy of antiviral agents for COVID-19.","Bassetti, Matteo; Corcione, Silvia; Dettori, Silvia; Lombardi, Andrea; Lupia, Tommaso; Vena, Antonio; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Gori, Andrea; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1927719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962524/,333

A harmonised, global longitudinal observational study protocol",2021-03-10,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by SARS-Cov-2 can be related to coagulopathy. Also, the infection-induced inflammatory changes are found in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The lack of previous immunity to COVID-19 has caused infection of a large number of patients worldwide and unpredictability regarding the management of the complications that appear in the course of this viral illness. Lungs are the most important target organ of the SARS-COV-2. In COVID-19 patients, acute lung injury leads to respiratory failure. However, multiorgan failure can also occur in these patients. The primary coagulopathy of COVID-19 is marked by a considerable elevation of D-dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen degradation products. In comparison, abnormalities in platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time are partly uncommon in initial presentations. Inflammatory biomarkers including CRP, LDH, and IL-6 are significantly elevated in the early stages of the disease. In this regard, inflammation-associated biomarkers and coagulation test screening, including the assessment of IL-6, CRP, LDH, D-dimer, platelet count, PT&PTT time, ferritin, and fibrinogen levels are suggested for detecting infection by this virus.

627552,The Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination Delay: A Data-Driven Modelling Analysis for Chicago and New York City,2021-08-31,"Severe sepsis and septic shock are a primary cause of death in patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Investigations upon genetic susceptibility profile to systemic complications during severe infections are a field of increasing scientific interest. Particularly when adaptive immune system is compromised or immature, innate immunity plays a key role in the immediate defense against invasive pathogens. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein that recognizes a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and activates complement cascade via the antibody-independent pathway. More than 30% of humans harbor mutations in MBL gene (MBL2) resulting in reduced plasmatic levels and activity. Increased risk of infection acquisition has been largely documented in MBL-deficient patients, but the real impact of this form of innate immunosuppression upon clinical outcome is not clear. In critically ill patients higher incidence and worse prognosis of severe sepsis/septic shock appear to be associated with low-producers haplotypes. However an excess of MBL activation might be also harmful due to the possibility of an unbalanced proinflammatory response and an additional host injury. Strategies of replacement therapies in critically ill patients with severe infections are under investigation but still far to be applied in clinical practice.","De Pascale, Gennaro; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Pennisi, Mariano Alberto; Antonelli, Massimo",Mediators Inflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24223476/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/625803,333
628081,"Clinical efficacy, speed of improvement and safety of apremilast for the treatment of adult Psoriasis during COVID‐19 pandemic",2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Community‐based studies of influenza and other respiratory viruses (eg, SARS‐CoV‐2) require laboratory confirmation of infection. During the current COVID‐19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order to protect both research staff and participants. Home‐collected respiratory specimens are less resource‐intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low‐contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi‐year, community‐based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home‐collected specimens for identification of influenza. METHODS: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home‐collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home‐collected compared to staff‐collected specimens. RESULTS: We tested 336 paired staff‐ and home‐collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT‐PCR; 150 staff‐collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78% to 86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96% to 100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%). CONCLUSIONS: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.","Malosh, Ryan E.; Petrie, Joshua G.; Callear, Amy P.; Monto, Arnold S.; Martin, Emily T.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107200/,333

Currently, in vivo studies of bats are hampered due to their low reproduction rates. To overcome this, we transplanted bat cells from bone marrow (BM) and spleen into an immunodeficient mouse strain NOD-scid IL-2R(−/−) (NSG), and have successfully established stable, long-term reconstitution of bat immune cells in mice (bat-mice). Immune functionality of our bat-mouse model was demonstrated through generation of antigen-specific antibody response by bat cells following immunization. Post-engraftment of total bat BM cells and splenocytes, bat immune cells survived, expanded and repopulated the mouse without any observable clinical abnormalities. Utilizing bat’s remarkable immunological functions, this novel model has a potential to be transformed into a powerful platform for basic and translational research.","Yong, Kylie Su Mei; Ng, Justin Han Jia; Her, Zhisheng; Hey, Ying Ying; Tan, Sue Yee; Tan, Wilson Wei Sheng; Irac, Sergio Erdal; Liu, Min; Chan, Xue Ying; Gunawan, Merry; Foo, Randy Jee Hiang; Low, Dolyce Hong Wen; Mendenhall, Ian Hewitt; Chionh, Yok Teng; Dutertre, Charles-Antoine; Chen, Qingfeng; Wang, Lin-Fa",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29549333/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22899-1,333

629239,Early Experience in Paris with the Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Vascular Surgery,2020-04-23,"The ability of powered flight in insects facilitated their great evolutionary success allowing them to occupy various ecological niches. Beyond this primary task, wings are often involved in various premating behaviors, such as the generation of courtship songs and the initiation of mating in flight. These specific functions imply special adaptations of wing morphology, as well as sex-specific wing morphologies. Although wing morphology has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, a comprehensive understa nding of sexual wing shape dimorphisms and developmental plasticity is missing for other Diptera. Therefore, we raised flies of the three Diptera species Drosophila melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata and Musca domestica at different environmental conditions and applied geometric morphometrics to analyze wing shape. Our data showed extensive interspecific differences in wing shape, as well as a clear sexual wing shape dimorphism in all three species. We revealed an impact of different rearing temperatures wing shape in all three species, which was mostly explained by plasticity in wing size in D. melanogaster. Rearing densities had significant effects on allometric wing shape in D. melanogaster, while no obvious effects were observed for the other two species. Additionally, we do not find evidence for sex-specific response to different rearing conditions in all three species. We determined species-specific and common trends in shape alterations, and we hypothesize developmental and functional implications of our data. Contribution to the Field Statement The size and shape of organisms and organs must be tightly controlled during development to ensure proper functionality. However, morphological traits vary considerably in nature contributing to phenotypic diversity. Such variation can be the result of evolutionary adaptations as well as plasticity for example as reaction to changing environmental conditions during development. It is therefore a major aim in Biology to unravel the processes that control differences in adult morphology. Insect wings are excellent models to study how organ size and shape evolves because they facilitate basic tasks such as mating and feeding. Accordingly, a tremendous variety of wings sizes and shapes evolved in nature. Additionally, plasticity in wing morphology in response to different rearing conditions has been observed in many insects contributing to phenotypic diversity. In this work we applied Geometric Morphometrics to study wing shape in the three Diptera species: the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, the Vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster and the housefly Musca domestica. Flies were raised in different temperature and density regimes that allowed us to study the effects of these environmental factors on wing shape. Additionally, in accordance with different mating behaviors of these flies, we observed a clear sexual shape dimorphism in all three species. Since the three studied species represent serious pests and disease vectors, our findings may contribute to existing and future monitoring efforts.","Reis, Micael; Siomava, Natalia; Wimmer, Ernst A.; Posnien, Nico",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/135749,333

630989,Recommendations for the Care of Pediatric Orthopaedic Patients During the COVID Pandemic,2020-04-14,"Hypertriglyceridemia is a metabolic complication associated with parenteral nutrition (PN). It is unknown if patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 are more at risk. Our aim was to describe the incidence, risk factors and clinical impact of hypertriglyceridemia in critically ill patients with ARDS-COVID-19 receiving PN. We designed a cohort study of patients with ARDS-COVID-19 infection that required admission to critical care units and nutritional support with PN. Individual PN prescriptions for macronutrients and insulin were provided. Lipid emulsion contained fish oil (SMOFlipid(®) or Lipoplus(®)). Hypertriglyceridemia was defined as plasma levels above 400 mg/dL. Eighty-seven patients, 66.6% men, 60.1 ± 10.8 years old, BMI 29.1 ± 5.6 kg/m(2), 71% of whom received lopinavir/ritonavir, 56% received Propofol and 55% received Tocilizumab were included. The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia was 37 × 100 patient-days with PN. This complication was more frequent in obese patients (OR 3.34; 95% CI, 2.35–4.33) and in those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (OR 4.98; 95% CI, 3.60–6.29) or Propofol (OR 2.45; 95% CI, 1.55–3.35). Total mortality was 33.3%, similar between the type of lipid emulsion (p = 0.478). On average, patients with hypertriglyceridemia had a longer requirement of PN compared to the group without elevated triglycerides (TG), probably because of their longer survival (p = 0.001). TG higher than 400 mg/dL was not a protective factor for mortality (OR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.01–1.30). In conclusion, the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia was 37 × 100 patient-days with PN. The risk of this complication is associated with obesity and the use of lopinavir/ritonavir or Propofol.","Villa López, Gema; Valero Zanuy, Maria Angeles; González Barrios, Ivan; Maíz Jiménez, Maria; Gomis Muñóz, Pilar; León Sanz, Miguel",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371797/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072287,333

The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify the infectious bronchitis virus in broiler flocks with respiratory diseases in four provinces of Iran. The specimens from forty IB suspected flocks from different regions of Isfahan, East Azerbaijan, Golestan, and Khuzestan provinces were collected, and the trachea, lung, and cecal tonsils were sampled. The samples were inoculated into 9- to 11-day—old embryonated chicken eggs. After collecting the allantoic fluid, RT-PCR was carried out to detect IB viruses. The results showed that IBVs were isolated from 30% of the flocks in these four provinces. The positive samples, according to a partial S1 gene sequence, were more investigated. Comparing nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed that the four isolates had the most similarity to the Pakistani 793/B strain (GI-13 lineage). The three isolates had the most considerable similarity in amino acid and nucleotide sequences to Iraqi and Iranian QX-like viruses (GI-19 lineage). Two isolates had 96 to 98% resemblance to Iranian variant-2 (GI-23 lineage) isolates.

631607,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on outpatient appointments of rheumatic patients in a non-outbreak area of China,2021-06-18,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Several countries have imposed lockdown and isolation, in attempt to mitigate viral spread. However, social isolation has negative impact on psychological aspects, increasing stress, fear, anxiety, anger and emotional disturbance, as well as affecting sleep pattern and physical activity practice. Negative emotions and lifestyle changes trigger overeating, consequently affecting dietary practices. The present study aimed to verify the prevalence of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep time/quality and physical exercise practice), eating behaviors dimensions, chronotype, and association with dietary practices (planning; domestic organization; food choice; ways of eating) in home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic in São Paulo, Brazil. This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 27 and May 25, 2020. An anonymous online questionnaire (Microsoft Forms®) was used for data collection by the snowball method. We verified dietary practices (outcome), eating behavior, physical exercise practice, sleep quality and duration, chronotype (exposure variables). Sex, age, educational and social status were assessed as covariates and confounders. Seven hundred twenty-four (585 women and 139 men) were evaluated. Mean ± SD of age was 32.6 ± 11.3 (women) and 33.5 ± 10.5 (men) years old. Emotional eating (EE) and Binge eating (BE) were positively correlated (r = 0.66; p <0.001) and dietary practices were negatively correlated with BE (r = -0.41; p <0.001), EE (r = -0.33; p <0.001) and BMI (r = -0.24; p <0.001). Linear regression demonstrated that EE (ß = - 0.1351, t = -2.841; p = 0.005; η(p)(2) = 0.013), BE (ß = - 0.2580, t = - 5.612; p < 0.001; η(p)(2) = 0.050), not doing physical exercise at home (ß = -0.4271, t = - 5.933 p < 0.001; η(p)(2) = 0.055), be vespertine (ß = -0.3435, t = 2.076 p = 0.038; η(p)(2) = 0.019) and age (ß = -0.082, t = -2.210; p = 0.027; η(p)(2) = 0.008) are negative predictors of dietary practices. Finally, cognitive restraint (ß = 0.1407, t = 3.858; p < 0.001; η(p)(2) = 0.024), better sleep quality (ß = 0.1768, t = 2.506; p = 0.012; η(p)(2) = 0.010), receive 4-10 salaries (ß = 0.2568, t = 2.573 p = 0.10; η(p)(2) = 0.027) and 10 – 20 salaries (ß = 0.4490, t = 3.726 p < 0.001; η(p)(2) = 0.027) are positive predictors of dietary practices. We conclude that the relationship between eating behavior, physical exercise, sleep, and social factors can be important predictors for dietary practices during social confinement by COVID-19.

632602,Role of lung ultrasound in patients requiring emergency surgery during COVID‐19 Pandemic,2020-10-14,"Abstract Wastewater-based monitoring of the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, also referred to as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), has been suggested as a tool to support epidemiology. An extensive sampling campaign, including nine municipal wastewater treatment plants, has been conducted in different cities of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) on the same day in April 2020, close to the first peak of the corona crisis. Samples were processed and analysed for a set of SARS-CoV-2-specific genes, as well as pan-genotypic gene sequences also covering other coronavirus types, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, a comprehensive set of chemical reference parameters and bioindicators was analysed to characterize the wastewater quality and composition. Results of the RT-qPCR based gene analysis indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic traces in different raw wastewaters. Furthermore, selected samples have been sequenced using Sanger technology to confirm the specificity of the RT-qPCR and the origin of the coronavirus. A comparison of the particle-bound and the dissolved portion of SARS-CoV-2 virus genes shows that quantifications must not neglect the solid-phase reservoir. The infectivity of the raw wastewater has also been assessed by viral outgrowth assay with a potential SARS-CoV2- host cell line in vitro, which were not infected when exposed to the samples. This first evidence suggests that wastewater might be no major route for transmission to humans. Our findings draw attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.","Westhaus, Sandra; Weber, Frank-Andreas; Schiwy, Sabrina; Linnemann, Volker; Brinkmann, Markus; Widera, Marek; Greve, Carola; Janke, Axel; Hollert, Henner; Wintgens, Thomas; Ciesek, Sandra",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720352797; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861187/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720352797?v=s5,333
634541,The Orthopaedic Trauma Service and COVID-19: Practice Considerations to Optimize Outcomes and Limit Exposure,2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND: Although COVID-19 is an acute disease that usually resolves rapidly in most cases, the disease can be fatal and has a mortality rate of about 1% to 56%. Alveolar injury and respiratory failure are the main causes of death in patients with COVID 19. In addition, the effect of the disease on other organs is not fully understood. Renal system affection has been reported in patients with COVID 19 and is associated with a higher rate of diverse outcomes, including mortality. Therefore, in the present work, we reported the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed the manifestations that indicated renal system involvement and their impact on clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an observational retrospective study conducted at King Fahd Specialist Hospital, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia. All patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to this Hospital from April to December 2020 were included in the study. The patients’ findings at presentation were recorded. Demographic data and laboratory results (hematuria, proteinuria, urinary sediment cast and pus cell presence, and kidney function tests) were retrieved from electronic patient records. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three patients with confirmed COVID 19 were included in the study. Dipstick examinations of all urine samples showed proteinuria and hematuria in 53.9% and 22.3% of patients, respectively, whereas microscopic examination revealed the presence of pus and brown muddy granular casts in 33.7% and 12.4% of samples, respectively. Acute kidney injury was reported in 23.3% of patients. A multivariable analysis demonstrated that hematuria was associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–4.9; P = 0.001), ICU admission (OR, 3.789; 95% CI, 1.913–7.505; P = 0.003), and mortality (OR, 8.084; 95% CI, 3.756–17.397; P = 0.002). Conversely, proteinuria was less significantly associated with the risk of AKI (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.91–7.50; P = 0.003), ICU admission (OR, 2.493; 95% CI, 1.25–4.72; P = 0.001), and mortality (OR, 2.764; 95% CI, 1.368–5.121; P = 0.003). Patients with AKI had a higher probability for mortality than did those without AKI (OR, 14.208; 95% CI, 6.434–31.375; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The manifestations of the involvement of the renal system are not uncommon in COVID-19. These manifestations included proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI and were usually associated with a poor prognosis, including high incidences of both ICU admission and mortality.","Allemailem, Khaled S.; Almatroudi, Ahmad; Khan, Amjad Ali; Rahmani, Arshad H.; Almarshad, Ibrahim S.; Alekezem, Fahad S.; Hassanein, Nagwa; El-Kady, Asmaa M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34264954/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253036,333
635326,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Gastrointestinal Procedures and Cancers in the United States. A Multicenter Research Network Study.,2021-03-01,"Despite the volume of experiments performed and data available, the complex biology of coronavirus SARS-COV-2 is not yet fully understood. Existing molecular profiling studies have focused on analysing functional omics data of a single type, which captures changes in a small subset of the molecular perturbations caused by the virus. As the logical next step, results from multiple such omics analysis may be aggregated to comprehensively interpret the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative approach is to integrate data simultaneously in a parallel fashion to highlight the inter-relationships of disease-driving biomolecules, in contrast to comparing processed information from each omics level separately. We demonstrate that valuable information may be masked by using the former fragmented views in analysis, and biomarkers resulting from such an approach cannot provide a systematic understanding of the disease aetiology. Hence, we present a generic, reproducible and flexible open-access data harmonisation framework that can be scaled out to future multi-omics analysis to study a phenotype in a holistic manner. The pipeline source code, detailed documentation and automated version as a R package are accessible. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we applied it to a drug screening task. We integrated multi-omics data to find the lowest level of statistical associations between data features in two case studies. Strongly correlated features within each of these two datasets were used for drug–target analysis, resulting in a list of 84 drug–target candidates. Further computational docking and toxicity analyses revealed seven high-confidence targets, amsacrine, bosutinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, nintedanib and sunitinib as potential starting points for drug therapy and development.","Chen, Tyrone; Philip, Melcy; Lê Cao, Kim-Anh; Tyagi, Sonika",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036326/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab185,333
635494,eHealth solutions to fight against COVID-19: A scoping review of applications,2021-04-01,"It is well known that mucosal tissues contain the largest surface area of the human body and are the front line of natural host defense against various pathogens. In fact, more than 80% of infectious disease pathogens probably gain entry into the susceptible human hosts through open mucosal surfaces. Human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1), a mainly sexually transmitted virus, also primarily targets the vaginal and gastrointestinal mucosa as entry sites for viral transmission, seeding, replication and amplification. Since HIV-1 establishes its early replication in vaginal or rectal mucosal tissues, the induction of sufficient mucosal immunity at the initial site of HIV-1 transmission becomes essential for a protective vaccine. However, despite the fact that current conventional vaccine strategies have remained unsuccessful in preventing HIV-1 infection, sufficient financial support and resources have yet to be given to develop a vaccine able to elicit protective mucosal immunity against sexual transmissions. Interestingly, Chinese ancestors invented variolation through intranasal administration about one thousand years ago, which led to the discovery of a successful smallpox vaccine and the final eradication of the disease. It is the hope for all mankind that the development of a mucosal AIDS vaccine will ultimately help control the AIDS pandemic. In order to discover an effective mucosal AIDS vaccine, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of mucosal immunology and to test various mucosal vaccination strategies.","Tang, Xian; Chen, Zhiwei",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994611/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v2010283,333
637947,"Addressing Palliative Care Needs of COVID-19 Patients in New Orleans, LA: A Team-Based Reflective Analysis",2020-07-22,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to offer a discussion on the existing data for the use of thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as well to present an evidence-based approach regarding the treatment for STEMI patients presenting to non-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)–capable hospitals during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been tremendous advances in the care of STEMI patients over the past two decades with primary (PCI) being the standard of care. However, many hospitals do not have interventional cardiology services available, and either have to expeditiously transfer patients for primary PCI, or use the strategy of fibrinolysis therapy with facilitated or rescue PCI. The current COVID-19 crisis has created an unprecedented paradigm shift with regard to the decision-making algorithm for STEMI patients especially in non-PCI-capable hospitals. Depending on regional transfer systems and potential delay in primary PCI, a strategy of thrombolysis first could be entertained at certain regional systems of care. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic decline in the number of patient seeking care for myocardial infarction as well as a reduction in the accessibility of cardiac catheterization services. Regardless, professional societies continue to recommend PCI as the primary means of treatment for STEMI through the COVID-19 pandemic, and early multicenter data suggests the benefit of this therapy remains. Future research will be necessary and holds the key to proving this benefit persists beyond the immediate hospitalization time period both in the current era and in the context of possible future pandemics.","Walters, Daniel; Mahmud, Ehtisham",Curr Cardiol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-021-01576-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585300/,333

A tres meses de que esta enfermedad fuera declarada pandemia, muchos países están tomando medidas de flexibilización del aislamiento. Sin embargo, sin una vacuna o medicamento capaz de enfrentar la infección por SARS-CoV-2, podría ser necesario revertir esta decisión en cualquier momento. En el presente trabajo se propone un algoritmo de decisión a fin de optimizar las detecciones de casos asintomáticos y administrar la cuarentena de una manera estratégica, para así evitar la diseminación del virus y tender hacia una nueva normalidad controlada. Se elaboró una propuesta tentativa de optimización de la cantidad de pruebas de detección del virus SARS-CoV-2 que se realicen, analizando muestras compuestas integradas por aquellas tomadas a distintas personas que integran ciertos grupos de interés. Se definieron grupos de personas según su función crítica en la sociedad o pertenencia a grupos muy vulnerables. El algoritmo propuesto contempla variables como la prioridad del grupo, el número de integrantes, el contacto intragrupal e intergrupal, la vulnerabilidad al contagio por la actividad desarrollada y el tiempo transcurrido desde que se realizó la prueba por última vez. Se ilustra la propuesta con un ejercicio de simulación basado en grupos hipotéticos y se demuestra que la aplicación de la herramienta permitiría establecer de una manera racional un orden de prioridad para realizar las pruebas en grupos críticos de la sociedad. Esta herramienta podría optimizar el uso de los recursos y disminuir el impacto del COVID-19 en la salud, la sociedad y la economía de una región. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world, leading most of the affected countries to close their borders and to establish lockdown in different versions. Three months after the pandemic started, many countries are making decisions tending to relax the lockdown, although without a vaccine or treatment capable of confronting SARS-CoV-2 infection, the situation could be reversed at any time. In this context, the aim of this work was to propose a decision algorithm that will allow the optimization of asymptomatic case detections and the strategic management of quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus and to allow a new controlled normality. This tentative proposal was developed to optimize the number of tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, analyzing composite samples (group analysis) that combine individual ones taken from different people that integrate the group of interest. Groups were defined according to their critical role in society and/or because they belong to vulnerable groups. The algorithm takes into account the following variables: group priority, number of members within the group, intragroup and intergroup contact, contact vulnerability due to the activity, and time elapsed since last testing. The proposed tool rationally allows to establish a priority order to assess critical groups in society. Furthermore, this tool could optimize the available resources, reducing the impact on a region's health, society, and economy.","Rivero, Mariano; Gutiérrez-Cacciabue, Dolores; Rajal, Verónica Beatriz; Irazusta, Verónica Patricia",Rev Argent Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0325754121000079?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0325754121000079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33610387/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2020.12.004,333

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of cases with confirmed and presumed fungal endogenous endophthalmitis, following severe COVID-19 disease, treated at two tertiary care referral eye institutes in North India. RESULTS: Seven eyes of five cases of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis were studied. All cases had been hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia and had received systemic steroid therapy for an average duration of 42 ± 25.1 days (range 18–80 days). All the cases initially complained of floaters with blurred vision after an average of 6 days (range 1–14 days) following discharge from hospital. They had all been misdiagnosed as noninfectious uveitis by their primary ophthalmologists. All eyes underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreal antifungal therapy. Five of the seven eyes grew fungus as the causative organism (Candida sp. in four eyes, Aspergillus sp. in one eye). Postoperatively, all eyes showed control of the infection with a marked reduction in vitreous exudates and improvement in vision. CONCLUSION: Floaters and blurred vision developed in patients after they recovered from severe COVID-19 infection. They had received prolonged corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19 as well as for suspected noninfectious uveitis. We diagnosed and treated them for endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. All eyes showed anatomical and functional improvement after PPV with antifungal therapy. It is important for ophthalmologists and physicians to be aware of this as prompt treatment could control the infection and salvage vision.","Shroff, Daraius; Narula, Ritesh; Atri, Neelam; Chakravarti, Arindam; Gandhi, Arpan; Sapra, Neelam; Bhatia, Gagan; Pawar, Shraddha R; Narain, Shishir",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146056/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_592_21,333

640144,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the cardiology services in Northern Jordan,2020-11-19,"INTRODUCTION: Computed tomography (CT) imaging has quickly found its place as a beneficial tool in the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, only a few studies have reported the distribution of lung lesions by segment. This study aimed to evaluate the lobar and segmental distribution of COVID-19 pneumonia based on patients’ chest CT scan. METHODS: This was a retrospective study performed on 63 Iranian adult patients with a final diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients had undergone chest CT scan on admission. Demographic data and imaging profile, including segmental distribution, were evaluated. Moreover, a scoring scale was designed to assess the severity of ground-glass opacification (GGO). The relationship of GGO score with age, sex, and symptoms at presentation was investigated. RESULTS: Among included patients, mean age of patients was 54.2 ±14.9 (range: 26 - 81) years old and 60.3% were male. Overall, the right lower lobe (87.3%) and the left lower lobe (85.7%) were more frequently involved. Specifically, predominant involvement was seen in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe (82.5%). The most common findings were peripheral GGO and consolidation, which were observed in 92.1% and 42.9% of patients, respectively. According to the self-designed GGO scoring scale, about half of the patients presented with mild GGO on admission. GGO score was found to be equally distributed among different sex and age categories; however, the presence of dyspnea on admission was significantly associated with a higher GGO score (p= 0.022). Cavitation, reticulation, calcification, bronchiectasis, tree-in-bud appearance and nodules were not identified in any of the cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 mainly affects the lower lobes of the lungs. GGO and consolidation in the lung periphery is the imaging hallmark in patients with COVID-19 infection. Absence of bronchiectasis, solitary nodules, cavitation, calcifications, tree-in-bud appearance, and reversed halo-sign indicates that these features are not common findings, at least in the earlier stages.","Haseli, Sara; Khalili, Nastaran; Bakhshayeshkaram, Mehrdad; Sanei Taheri, Morteza; Moharramzad, Yashar",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32440666/,333

In order to reduce this percentage, physicians should establish clear and objective criteria to stratify COVID‐19 patients at high risk of in‐hospital death. Thus, the aim has been to test a large spectrum of variables ranging from clinical evaluation to laboratory biomarkers to identify which parameter would best predict all‐cause in‐hospital mortality in COVID‐19 patients. DESIGN: observational study. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that each 5 years of increase in age corresponded to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.28 (95% CI 1.00‐1.65, P = .050); each increment of 803 ng/L of N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) corresponded to a HR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.11‐1.39, P < .001); each increment of 58 ng/L of interleukin (IL)‐6 corresponded to a HR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.09‐1.40, P < .001), and each increment of 250 U/L of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) corresponded to a HR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.10‐1.37, P < .001). According to the calculated cut‐points for age (≥70 years), NT‐proBNP (≥803 ng/L), IL‐6 (≥58 ng/L) and LDH (≥371 U/L) when 2 out of these 4 were overcome, the HR was 2.96 (95% CI 1.97‐4.45, P < .001).

Sixty-two anesthesiology trainees, novice to the usage of FTB, participated in this study. Following a video demonstration, each participant performed endotracheal intubation on a manikin standardized to a difficult airway view. Each participant performed direct laryngoscopy and intubated the manikin using a conventional bougie and FTB, at least 1 day in between devices, in a randomized order. The first pass success rate was significantly higher with FTB (98.4%) compared to conventional bougie (85.5%), p = 0.008. The median time to intubation was significantly faster when using FTB, median = 32.0 s [Interquartile range (IQR): 23.8–41.3 s] compared to when using conventional bougie, median = 41.5 s (IQR: 31.8–69.5 s), p < 0.001. The FTB required significantly less intubation attempts compared to conventional bougie, p = 0.024. The overall ease of use, scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, was significantly higher in the FTB (4.26 ± 0.53) compared to the conventional bougie (3.19 ± 0.83), p < 0.001. This simulated difficult airway manikin study finding suggested that FTB is a useful adjunct for difficult airway intubation.

As more than one year elapsed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of medical studies involving the SARS-CoV-2 virus helped researchers and medical practitioners in understanding the effects it has on all sorts of patients until effective vaccines were finally developed and distributed for mass vaccination. Still, the SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants remain a potential threat towards all categories of patients, including a more delicate group represented by pregnant women. Thus, the current study aims to investigate the potential effects on obstetrical outcomes after a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: This single-center prospective cohort study investigated the pregnancy outcomes in a total of 1039 eligible pregnant women between 30 August 2020 and 30 January 2021. Multiple patient characteristics and obstetrical outcomes were tested and analyzed in a multivariate regression model to establish potential risks determined by a COVID-19-positive pregnancy towards the mother and the newborn. Results: In the study sample, there were 938 pregnancies included without COVID-19 and 101 pregnant women identified with a positive COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 was significantly associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of premature rupture of membranes and 1.5 times higher risk of preterm birth with emergency c-sections and lower APGAR scores. Also, significantly more newborns were given birth prematurely, with lower APGAR scores after the mothers were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: A third-trimester infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a significant risk factor for preterm birth via an emergency cesarean section, a premature rupture of membranes, and a lower APGAR score in newborns, as compared with pregnancies where COVID-19 was not identified.","Timircan, Madalina; Bratosin, Felix; Vidican, Iulia; Suciu, Oana; Tirnea, Livius; Avram, Valentina; Marincu, Iosif",Medicina (Kaunas),https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57080796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441002/,333

644972,COVID-19 highlights the need for universal adoption of standards of medical care for physicians in nursing homes in Europe,2020-06-17,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline during the pandemic of COVID-19 globally. According to the WHO situation report at April 17, there were 22, 073 HCWs contracted the infection. Whether the infection control policy and practice in the hospital setting can protect the HCWs is an important issue. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional serology study in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan to explore the sero-prevalence rate among HCWs. The participants are enrolled on a voluntary basis. A structured questionnaire was collected to gather the epidemiology character and risk factors for potential exposure. ELISA tests as Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) were used to detect antibody responses. If any of the tests was positive, a western blot assay was used for confirmation. RESULTS: There were 194 HCWs participated during July 1 to Aug. 31, 2020. The mean age was 36.3 ± 10.4. More than half of the participants had possible hospital associated risk for COVID-19 exposure (110/192, 57.3%) and 64 had possible community risk for COVID-19 exposure (64/194, 33.0%). There was only one participant had positive test by Architect IgG test and confirmed to be negative for seasonal coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 antibody. (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Germany). CONCLUSION: The cross-sectional serology study in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan revealed no HCWs had positive serology response to SARS-CoV-2. We believe that the infection control policy and practice in the hospital and in the community are both important to prevent the disease transmission.","Pan, Sung-Ching; Huang, Yu-Shan; Hsieh, Szu-Min; Chen, Yee-Chun; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Chang, Shan-Chwen",J Formos Med Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2021.01.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092966462100019X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461841/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092966462100019X,333
645096,Quis custodiet ipsos custodes: are we taking care of healthcare workers in the Italian Covid-19 outbreak?,2020-05-07,"The emergency department (ED) is an essential component of the public health response plan for control of acute respiratory infectious threats. Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Threat of contagion exists not only for ED patients but also for visitors, health care workers, and inpatient populations. Potential physical sites for respiratory disease transmission extend from out-of-hospital care, to triage, waiting room, ED treatment area, and the hospital at large. This article presents a summary of the most current information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, and legal issues. Wherever possible, specific recommendations and references to practical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are provided. The “Administrative Issues” section describes coordination with public health departments, procedures for effective facility planning, and measures for health care worker protection (education, staffing optimization, and vaccination). The patient care section addresses the potentially infected ED patient, including emergency medical services concerns, triage planning, and patient transport. “Legal Issues” discusses the interplay between public safety and patient privacy. Emergency physicians play a critical role in early identification, treatment, and containment of potentially lethal respiratory pathogens. This brief synopsis should help clinicians and administrators understand, develop, and implement appropriate policies and procedures to address respiratory hygiene in the ED.","Rothman, Richard E.; Irvin, Charlene B.; Moran, Gregory J.; Sauer, Lauren; Bradshaw, Ylisabyth S.; Fry, Robert B.; Josephson, Elaine B.; Ledyard, Holly K.; Hirshon, Jon Mark",Ann Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17052558/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064406007037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064406007037,333

A severe problem of online evaluation is that it enables various technological possibilities that facilitate students' unethical behaviors. The research aimed to investigate these behaviors, as well as the reasons for their appearance, as practiced in exams held for the first time during the Covid-19 pandemic, and to elicit students' and lecturers' perceptions of students' academic dishonesty (AD) during this period. The sample included 81 students and 50 lecturers from several Israeli colleges and universities. The findings expand extant knowledge on academic dishonesty, identifying significant differences between the perceptions of students and lecturers concerning attitudes towards online exams and the reasons for dishonest behaviors. The findings among the students also indicate that younger students and Arab students tended to cheat more in online exams. Moreover, the findings indicated a lack of mutual trust between students and lecturers with regard to academic dishonesty, a deep distrust that will probably continue even after the Covid-19 crisis. This last finding should be a cause of concern for higher education policy-makers, affecting future policies for improving lecturer-student relations, especially during crises. Recommendations are proposed for addressing academic dishonesty in exams in general and during the pandemic in particular.","Amzalag, Meital; Shapira, Noa; Dolev, Niva",J Acad Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10805-021-09413-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33846681/,333

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the prevention and control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic on NIs. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyze the prevalence of NIs before and after COVID-19 pandemic for 6 months in the Children’s Hospital of Soochow University. RESULTS: A total of 39,914 patients in 2019 and 34,645 patients in 2020 were admitted to the hospital during the study. There were 1.39% (481/34645) of patients with NIs in 2020, which was significantly lower than the 2.56% (1021/39914) of patients in 2019. The rate of critical and fatal cases was also decreased. In addition, the rate of appropriate handwashing, the number of protective gloves and aprons used per person and the number of healthcare staff per patients were significantly increased. Except for the ICU, the prevalence of nosocomial infection in most departments decreased from 2019 to 2020. Regarding the source of infections, a significant reduction was mainly observed in respiratory (0.99% vs 0.42%, p = 0.000) and digestive tract (0.63% vs 0.14%, p = 0.000). The microorganism analysis of respiratory infections indicated an obvious decline in acinetobacters and fungi. The most significant decline of pathogens in gastrointestinal infections was observed for rotavirus. The comparison of catheter-related nosocomial infections between 2019 and 2020 did not show significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention and control measures for the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced the nosocomial infection in almost all departments, except the ICU, mainly regarding respiratory, gastrointestinal, and oral infections, while catheter-related infections did not show any differences.","Su, Chunmei; Zhang, Zhiqin; Zhao, Xu; Peng, Hanlin; Hong, Yi; Huang, Lili; Huang, Jie; Yan, Xiangming; Wu, Shuiyan; Bai, Zhenjiang",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06396-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281515/,333

METHODS: This is a 2-points cross-sectional study (5 years apart; 2014-2019) conducted among PICUs and SCICUs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Children who have stayed in PICU for more than 21 days were included. RESULTS: Out of the 11 units approached, 10 (90%) agreed to participate. The prevalence of LSP in all these hospitals decreased from 32% (48/150) in 2014 to 23.4% (35/149) in 2019. The length of stay ranged from 22 days to 13.5 years. The majority of LSP had a neuromuscular or cardiac disease and were admitted with respiratory compromise. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most prevalent complication (37.5%). The most commonly used resources were mechanical ventilation (93.8%), antibiotics (60.4%), and blood-products transfusions (35.4%). The most common reason for the extended stay was medical reasons (51.1%), followed by a lack of family resources (26.5%) or lack of referral to long-term care facilities (22.4%). CONCLUSION: A long-stay is associated with significant critical care bed occupancy, complications, and utilization of resources that could be otherwise utilized as surge capacity for critical care services. Decreasing occupancy in this multicenter study deserves further engagement of the healthcare leaders and families to maximize the utilization of resources.","Temsah, Mohamad-Hani A.; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman A.; Al-Sohime, Fahad M.; Hassounah, Marwah M.; Almazyad, Mohammed A.; Hasan, Gamal M.; Jamal, Amr A.; Alhaboob, Ali A.; Alabdulhafid, Majed A.; Abouammoh, Noura A.; Alhasan, Khalid A.; Alwohaibi, Abdullah A.; Al Mana, Yousef T.; Alturki, Abdullah T.",Saudi Med J,https://doi.org/10.15537/smj.2020.11.25450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130838/,333

Immune cell activation via pattern recognition receptors has been implicated as a driver of the hyperinflammatory response seen in COVID-19. However, our understanding of the specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 remains limited. Mast cells (MCs) and eosinophils are innate immune cells that play pathogenic roles in many inflammatory responses. Here we report MC-derived proteases and eosinophil-associated mediators are elevated in COVID-19 patient sera and lung tissues. Stimulation of viral-sensing toll-like receptors in vitro and administration of synthetic viral RNA in vivo induced features of hyperinflammation, including cytokine elevation, immune cell airway infiltration, and MC-protease production—effects suppressed by an anti-Siglec-8 monoclonal antibody which selectively inhibits MCs and depletes eosinophils. Similarly, anti-Siglec-8 treatment reduced disease severity and airway inflammation in a respiratory viral infection model. These results suggest that MC and eosinophil activation are associated with COVID-19 inflammation and anti-Siglec-8 antibodies are a potential therapeutic approach for attenuating excessive inflammation during viral infections.","Gebremeskel, Simon; Schanin, Julia; Coyle, Krysta M.; Butuci, Melina; Luu, Thuy; Brock, Emily C.; Xu, Alan; Wong, Alan; Leung, John; Korver, Wouter; Morin, Ryan D.; Schleimer, Robert P.; Bochner, Bruce S.; Youngblood, Bradford A.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777047/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.650331,333

For patients with preexisting autoimmune disorders, often complicated by immunosuppressive therapies, there are numerous potential effects of COVID-19, a disease of complex immunobiology, including the potential for an altered natural history of COVID-19 when infected. In addition, individuals without recognized autoimmune disease may be vulnerable to virally induced autoimmunity in the forms of autoantibody formation, as well as the development of clinical immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Until quite recently in the pandemic, this relationship between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases has been relatively underexplored; yet such investigation offers potential insights into immunopathogenesis as well as for the development of new immune-based therapeutics.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetric and gynecologic procedures and consults at a New York City hospital,2020-11-26,"BACKGROUND: Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are important causes of upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) and lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). To analyse epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the four types of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) were studied in Guangzhou, southern China. METHODS: Throat swabs (n=4755) were collected and tested from children and adults with ARTI over a 26-month period, and 4447 of 4755 (93.5%) patients’ clinical presentations were recorded for further analysis. RESULTS: Of 4755 patients tested, 178 (3.7%) were positive for HPIV. Ninety-nine (2.1%) samples were positive for HPIV-3, 58 (1.2%) for HPIV-1, 19 (0.4%) for HPIV-2 and 8 (0.2%) for HPIV-4. 160/178 (88.9%) HPIV-positive samples were from paediatric patients younger than 5 years old, but no infant under one month of age was HPIV positive. Seasonal peaks of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 occurred as autumn turned to winter and summer turned to autumn. HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 were detected less frequently, and their frequency of isolation increased when the frequency of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 declined. HPIV infection led to a wide spectrum of symptoms, and more “hoarseness” (p=0.015), “abnormal pulmonary breathing sound” (p<0.001), “dyspnoea” (p<0.001), “pneumonia” (p=0.01), and “diarrhoea” (p<0.001) presented in HPIV-positive patients than HPIV-negative patients. 10/10 (100%) HPIV-positive adult patients (≥14 years old) presented with systemic influenza-like symptoms, while 90/164 (54.9%) HPIV-positive paediatric patients (<14 years old) presented with these symptoms (p=0.005). The only significant difference in clinical presentation between HPIV types was “Expectoration” (p<0.001). Co-infections were common, with 33.3%–63.2% of samples positive for the four HPIV types also testing positive for other respiratory pathogens. However, no significant differences were seen in clinical presentation between patients solely infected with HPIV and patients co-infected with HPIV and other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: HPIV infection led to a wide spectrum of symptoms, and similar clinical manifestations were found in the patients with four different types of HPIVs. The study suggested pathogenic activity of HPIV in gastrointestinal illness. The clinical presentation of HPIV infection may differ by patient age.","Liu, Wen-Kuan; Liu, Qian; Chen, De-Hui; Liang, Huan-Xi; Chen, Xiao-Kai; Huang, Wen-Bo; Qin, Sheng; Yang, Zi-Feng; Zhou, Rong",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23343342/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-28,333

A 33-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a one-week history of cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia, with no other significant past medical history. She tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently, her respiratory function rapidly deteriorated, necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. She had severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring a protracted period on the mechanical ventilator with different ventilation strategies and multiple cycles of prone positioning. During her proning, after two weeks on the intensive care unit, she developed tension pneumothorax that required bilateral intercostal chest drains (ICD) to stabilise her. After 24 days, she had a percutaneous tracheostomy and began her respiratory wean; however, this was limited due to the ongoing infection. Thorax CT demonstrated a left-sided pneumothorax, with bilateral pneumatoceles and a sizeable, complex hydropneumothorax. Despite the insertion of ICDs, the hydropneumothorax persisted over months and initially progressed in size on serial scans needing multiple ICDs. She was too ill for surgical interventions initially, opting for conservative management. After 60 days, she successfully underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for a washout and placement of further ICDs. She was successfully decannulated after 109 days on the intensive care unit and was discharged to a rehabilitation unit after 116 days of being an inpatient, with her last thorax CT showing some residual pneumatoceles but significant improvement. Late changes may mean patients recovering from the COVID-19 infection are at increased risk of pneumothoracies. Clinicians need to be alert to this, especially as bullous rupture may not present as a classical pneumothorax.","Rehnberg, Lucas; Chambers, Robert; Lam, Selina; Chamberlain, Martin; Dushianthan, Ahilanandan",Case Rep Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32963836/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8896923,333

This report describes the construction and characterisation of a recombinant vaccinia virus designed to express modified forms of the E6 and E7 proteins from HPV16 and HPV18, the viruses most commonly associated with cervical cancer. The recombinant virus (designated TA-HPV) was based on the Wyeth vaccine strain of vaccinia, and was shown to express the desired gene products. Studies in mice indicated that the recombinant virus was less neurovirulent than the parental virus and was capable of inducing an HPV-specific CTL response.

The first experiment investigates undergraduate students’ music listening niches in the initial COVID-19 lockdown period, 4 weeks immediately after the campus shut down abruptly. The second experiment explores how returning to a hybrid semester, the “new normal,” further affected these listening habits. In both experiments, the participants provided a list of their most frequently listened-to songs during the respective period of time. From these, they identified one song that seemed most associated with this period, their “signature song,” and stated why this song seemed relevant. These reasons were coded on nine underlying themes. Three clusters were found to underlie the themes: (1) emotional responses (2) memory associations, and (3) discovery of new music. We identified songs and reasons for selecting them that represented the three clusters and related these to the lyrical content. Compared to before the pandemic, participants in both experiments report listening more in general and on Spotify, but there were no differences in listening between lockdown and the new normal.

650984,Makeshift face shield for healthcare professionals during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-05-21,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the infection of highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as the novel coronavirus. In most countries, the containment of this virus spread is not controlled, which is driving the pandemic towards a more difficult phase. In this study, we investigated the impact of the Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination on the severity and mortality of COVID‐19 by performing transcriptomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected and BCG vaccinated samples in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). A set of common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and seeded into their functional enrichment analyses via Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional terms and pre-annotated molecular pathways databases, and their Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis. We further analyzed the regulatory elements, possible comorbidities and putative drug candidates for COVID-19 patients who have not been BCG-vaccinated. Differential expression analyses of both BCG-vaccinated and COVID-19 infected samples identified 62 shared DEGs indicating their discordant expression pattern in their respected conditions compared to control. Next, PPI analysis of those DEGs revealed 10 hub genes, namely ITGB2, CXCL8, CXCL1, CCR2, IFNG, CCL4, PTGS2, ADORA3, TLR5 and CD33. Functional enrichment analyses found significantly enriched pathways/GO terms including cytokine activities, lysosome, IL-17 signalling pathway, TNF-signalling pathways. Moreover, a set of identified TFs, miRNAs and potential drug molecules were further investigated to assess their biological in COVID-19 and therapeutic possibilities. Findings showed significant genetic interactions between BCG vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an interesting prospect of the BCG vaccine in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope it may potentially trigger further research on this critical phenomenon to combat COVID-19 spread.","Chowdhury, Utpala Nanda; Faruqe, Md. Omar; Mehedy, Md.; Ahmad, Shamim; Islam, M.

Mental health is becoming an issue that cannot be ignored in our fight against it. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively. The bivariate correlations showed that less social support was correlated with more anxious (r=-0.196, p<0.05) and depressive (r=-0.360，p<0.05) symptoms among patients with COVID-19. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that gender (β=1.446, p=0.034), age (β=0.074, p=0.003), oxygen saturation (β =-2.140, p=0.049), and social support (β =-1.545, p=0.017) were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, age (β=0.084, p=0.001), family infection with SARS-CoV-2 (β =1.515, p=0.027) and social support (β =-2.236, p＜0.001) were the factors associated with depression. Conclusion: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 presented features of anxiety and depression.

Airway epithelial cells (AEC) are playing a critical role in the immune response and in COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 infects the airways through ACE2 receptor and the host protease TMPRSS2 was shown to play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Here, we show that the main component of P. aeruginosa flagella, ie. flagellin is able to increase TMPRSS2 expression in AEC, and even more in those deficient for CFTR. Importantly, this increased TMPRSS2 expression is associated with an increase in the level of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the urgency of the health situation, this result is of major significance for patients with CF which are frequently infected and colonized by P. aeruginosa during the course of the disease.","Ruffin, Manon; Bigot, Jeanne; Calmel, Claire; Mercier, Julia; Pizzorno, Andres; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Corvol, Harriet; Balloy, Viviane; Terrier, Olivier; Guillot, Loic",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.264564,333
653915,The Psychiatric Burden on Medical Students in New York City Entering Clinical Clerkships During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-10-07,"Therapeutic modalities designed specifically to inhibit COVID-19 infection and replication would limit progressive COVID-19-associated pulmonary disease in infected patients and prevent or limit systemic disease. If effective, antivirals could reduce viral transmission rates by reducing viral burden and allow time for immune clearance. For individuals infected with acute-stage disease, antivirals in support of the existing vaccines could reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Here, we evaluate MRCV-19, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligo with delivery dendrimer (Vivo-Morpholino), to prevent coronavirus infection in a cell culture model. This is a novel antiviral that effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. By design, MRCV-19 targets the SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR and overlaps the pp1a start site of translation in order to block access of the translation initiation complex to the start. MRCV-19 testing is conducted in a high-throughput, 384-well plate format with a 10-point dose-response curve (common ratio of 2) assayed in duplicate with parallel cytotoxicity evaluations. MRCV-19 was shown to be more effective than hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir in our CPE reduction assay with low toxicity. The clinical translational impact of this study is providing the basis for evaluating MRCV-19 on a large scale in an appropriate infection model for toxicity and systemic high-level inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, which could lead in time to phase I testing in humans.","Hildreth, James E.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TGF-β expression in acute hantavirus infection. RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 77 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany in 2012. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-Puumala hantavirus IgG and IgM. Plasma levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β2 were analysed. Based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. Puumala virus RNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral L segment gene. Out of 77 Puumala virus infected patients, 52 (68%) were male. A seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer 2012, the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30–39 years. Puumala virus RNA was detectable in 4/77 cases. Patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease (6.2 vs 3.6 days). Thrombocyte count (186 vs 225 per nl), serum TGF-β1 (74 vs 118 ng/l) and TGF-β2 (479 vs 586 pg/l) were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. However, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in patients with severe disease (62 vs 40 mg/l). TGF-β1/Cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: High serum CRP and low serum TGF-β in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease. Our results support the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis in hantavirus infection.","Sadeghi, Mahmoud; Lahdou, Imad; Ettinger, Jakob; Navid, Mojdeh Heidary; Daniel, Volker; Zeier, Martin; Hofmann, Jörg; Opelz, Gerhard; Schnitzler, Paul",BMC Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25888018/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12865-015-0085-0,333

However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients’ lymphopenia.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 47 insertions with hybrid intracavitary and interstitial applicators were performed in 23 patients from March 2017 to March 2020. Moderate sedation was achieved with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl administered by non-anesthetist. Insertion time and procedural time was recorded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the impact of different factors on insertion and procedural time. RESULTS: A total of 238 needles (range, 2-8 per insertion) were implanted, with an average insertion depth of 30 mm (range, 20-40 mm). The mean doses for midazolam and fentanyl were 3 mg (standard deviation [SD] = 1) and 53.3 mcg (SD = 23.9) per insertion, respectively. The median insertion time was 30 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 22-40), and the median total procedural time was 4.3 hours (IQR = 3.6-5.2). First time insertion, insertions performed before 2019, and higher midazolam dose were associated with significantly longer insertion time, whereas longer insertion time, MRI-based planning, and insertions performed before 2019 were associated with significantly longer total procedural time.

To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic in a rapid format behooving an emergent pandemic we conducted a scoping review. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on maternal health and provide an overview of the most significant outcomes thus far. Working papers and news articles were considered appropriate evidence along with peer-reviewed publications in order to capture rapidly evolving updates. Literature in English published from January 1st to September 11 2020 was included if it pertained to the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical, mental, economic, or social health and wellbeing of pregnant people. Narrative descriptions were written about subject areas for which the authors found the most evidence. RESULTS: The search yielded 396 publications, of which 95 were included. Pregnant individuals were found to be at a heightened risk of more severe symptoms than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine, vertical, and breastmilk transmission were unlikely. Labor, delivery, and breastfeeding guidelines for COVID-19 positive patients varied. Severe increases in maternal mental health issues, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, were reported. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies implemented with little evidence. Women were more likely to lose their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women and mothers were not found to be at higher risk for COVID-19 infection than people who are not pregnant, however pregnant people with symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more adverse outcomes compared to non-pregnant people and seem to face disproportionate adverse socio-economic consequences. High income and low- and middle-income countries alike faced significant struggles. Further resources should be directed towards quality epidemiological studies. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The Covid-19 pandemic impacts reproductive and perinatal health both directly through infection itself but also indirectly as a consequence of changes in health care, social policy, or social and economic circumstances. The direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 on maternal health are intertwined. To provide a comprehensive overview on this broad topic we conducted a scoping review. Pregnant women who have symptomatic COVID-19 may experience more severe outcomes than people who are not pregnant. Intrauterine and breastmilk transmission, and the passage of the virus from mother to baby during delivery are unlikely. The guidelines for labor, delivery, and breastfeeding for COVID-19 positive patients vary, and this variability could create uncertainty and unnecessary harm. Prenatal care visits decreased, healthcare infrastructure was strained, and potentially harmful policies are implemented with little evidence in high and low/middle income countries. The social and economic impact of COVID-19 on maternal health is marked. A high frequency of maternal mental health problems, such as clinically relevant anxiety and depression, during the epidemic are reported in many countries. This likely reflects an increase in problems, but studies demonstrating a true change are lacking. Domestic violence appeared to spike. Women were more vulnerable to losing their income due to the pandemic than men, and working mothers struggled with increased childcare demands. We make several recommendations: more resources should be directed to epidemiological studies, health and social services for pregnant women and mothers should not be diminished, and more focus on maternal mental health during the epidemic is needed.","Kotlar, Bethany; Gerson, Emily; Petrillo, Sophia; Langer, Ana; Tiemeier, Henning",Reprod Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01070-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461593/,333

Initial identification of high titer units was based on dose–response data using the Ortho VITROS IgG assay. The proliferation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serological assays and non‐uniform application has led to uncertainty about their interrelationships. The purpose of this study was to establish correlations and analogous cutoffs between multiple serological assays. METHODS: We compared the Ortho, Abbott, Roche, an anti‐spike (S) ELISA, and a virus neutralization assay. Relationships relative to FDA‐approved cutoffs under the CCP emergency use authorization were identified in convalescent plasma from a cohort of 79 donors from April 2020. RESULTS: Relative to the neutralization assay, the spearman r value of the Ortho Clinical, Abbott, Roche, anti‐S ELISA assays was 0.65, 0.59, 0.45, and 0.76, respectively. The best correlative index for establishing high‐titer units was 3.87 signal‐to‐cutoff (S/C) for the Abbott, 13.82 cutoff index for the Roche, 1:1412 for the anti‐S ELISA, 1:219 by the neutralization assay, and 15.9 S/C by the Ortho Clinical assay. The overall agreement using derived cutoffs compared to a neutralizing titer of 1:250 was 78.5% for Abbott, 74.7% for Roche, 83.5% for the anti‐S ELISA, and 78.5% for Ortho Clinical. DISCUSSION: Assays based on antibodies against the nucleoprotein were positively associated with neutralizing titers and the Ortho assay, although their ability to distinguish FDA high‐titer specimens was imperfect. The resulting relationships help reconcile results from the large body of serological data generated during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Farnsworth, Christopher W.; Case, James B.; Hock, Karl; Chen, Rita E.; O'Halloran, Jane A.; Presti, Rachel; Goss, Charles W.; Rauseo, Adriana M.; Ellebedy, Ali; Theel, Elitza S.; Diamond, Michael S.; Henderson, Jeffrey P.",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216156/,333

METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or ≥71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 μg or 100 μg of vaccine administered 28 days apart. RESULTS: Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-μg dose, the anti–S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-μg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-μg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-μg dose, which supports the use of the 100-μg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

We validated three different antibody assays: chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) Abbott Architect SARS‐­CoV­‐2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), enzyme­ linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) CoronaPass total antibodies test, and ELISA SARS­‐CoV‐­2‐­IgG‐­EIA‐­BEST. Clinical sensitivity was estimated with the SARS­‐CoV­‐2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as the gold standard using manufacturer recommended cutoff. Specificity was estimated using pre­pandemic sera samples. The median time between positive PCR test results and antibody tests was 21 weeks. Measures of concordance were calculated against the microneutralization test (MNA).Sensitivity was equal to 91.1% (95% confidence intervbal [CI]: 78.8–97.5), 90% (95% CI: 76.4–96.4), and 63.1% (95% CI [50.2–74.7]) for ELISA Coronapass, ELISA Vector­Best, and CMIA Abbott, respectively. Specificity was equal to 100% for all the tests. Comparison of receiver operating characteristics has shown lower AUC for CMIA Abbott. The cut­off SC/O ratio of 0.28 for CMIA Abbott resulted in a sensitivity of 80% at the same level of specificity. Less than 33% of the participants with positive antibody test results had neutralizing antibodies in titers 1:80 and above. Antibody assays results and MNA correlated moderately. This study encourages the use of local antibody tests and sets the reference for seroprevalence correction. Available tests' sensitivity allows detecting antibodies within the majority of PCR­ positive individuals. The Abbott assay sensitivity can be improved by incorporating a new cut­off. Manufacturers' test characteristics may introduce bias into the study results.","Barchuk, Anton; Shirokov, Daniil; Sergeeva, Mariia; Tursun­zade, Rustam; Dudkina, Olga; Tychkova, Varvara; Barabanova, Lubov; Skougarevskiy, Dmitriy; Danilenko, Daria",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081328/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27126,333

Moreover, airway cases, which mostly present as emergency, cannot be deferred. Being a tertiary airway centre and having received a number of airway cases, most of them requiring prompt surgical intervention, our airway surgery and anaesthesiology team had to work in conjunction to adapt and readapt the practice over the past few months, striving to achieve effective airway surgery protocols, to minimize exposure and prevent transmission of COVID 19. To enlist the encountered airway cases during COVID 19 pandemic and to highlight the important inclusions and adaptations in executing the airway surgeries. A retrospective observational study of 7 months duration was carried out. This is a single institutional study, where the sample included the primary as well the referred airway cases. Apart from Tracheotomy, Foreign body bronchus removal, Dilatation of Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS) and excision of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP), we also have had the experience to deal with congenital Laryngo-tracheo-oesophageal Cleft (LTOC) Type III b, Thyroid surgery to relieve tracheal compression and Bilateral Choanal Atresia repair during the last 7 months. Routine 2 weeks follow up of the patients have been favourable, as there has not been any report or clinical features of transmission of COVID 19. As the airway surgeries could be executed with the incorporation of certain change in practice and as the follow up revealed no evidence of transmission, we attempt to contribute to airway best practice guideline for maintaining the safety of patients and health professionals.","Kalita, Sanchita; Gogoi, Biswajit; Khaund, Gautam; Agarwal, Vivek; Borah, Partha Pratim; Dutta, Anup; Gogoi, Daisy",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33432295/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-020-02326-6,333
658794,Medical Mistrust and Stigma Associated with COVID-19 Among People Living with HIV in South Africa,2021-05-17,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 outbreak, reports have surfaced of children who present with features of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with overlapping features of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome - Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome- temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (PIMS-TS). Initial reports find that many of the children are PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, so it is difficult to confirm whether this syndrome is a late complication of viral infection in an age group largely spared the worst consequences of this infection, or if this syndrome reflects enhanced surveillance. METHODS: Children hospitalised for symptoms consistent with PIMS-TS between 28 April and 8 May 2020, and who were PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2, were tested for antibodies to viral spike glycoprotein using an ELISA test. RESULTS: Eight patients (age range 7–14 years, 63% male) fulfilled case-definition for PIMS-TS during the study period. Six of the eight patients required admission to intensive care. All patients exhibited significant IgG and IgA responses to viral spike glycoprotein. Further assessment showed that the IgG isotypes detected in children with PIMS-TS were of the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, a distribution similar to that observed in samples from hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients. In contrast, IgG2 and IgG4 were not detected in children or adults. IgM was not detected in children, which contrasts with adult hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients of whom all had positive IgM responses. CONCLUSIONS: Strong IgG antibody responses can be detected in PCR-negative children with PIMS-TS. The low detection rate of IgM in these patients is consistent with infection having occurred weeks previously and that the syndrome onset occurs well after the control of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. This implies that the disease is largely immune-mediated. Lastly, this indicates that serology can be an appropriate diagnostic tool in select patient groups.","Perez-Toledo, Marisol; Faustini, Sian E.; Jossi, Sian E.; Shields, Adrian M.; Kanthimathinathan, Hari Krishnan; Allen, Joel D.; Watanabe, Yasunori; Goodall, Margaret; Wraith, David C.; Veenith, Tonny V.; Drayson, Mark T.; Jyothish, Deepthi; Al-Abadi, Eslam; Chikermane, Ashish; Welch, Steven B.; Masilamani, Kavitha; Hackett, Scott; Crispin, Max; Scholefield, Barnaby R; Cunningham, Adam F.; Richter, Alex G.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.05.20123117v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.20123117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577677/,333

Previous methods for adjusting reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which usually have lots of missing values that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. We show this Bayesian approach lead to accurate estimates of the epidemic curve and time-varying reproductive numbers and is robust to deviations from model assumptions. We apply the Bayesian approach to COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproductive number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.","Li, T.; White, L.

Methods This non-randomized prospective cohort study was conducted from May 21, 2020, to June 30, 2020, at four major tertiary hospitals in Kuwait. CCP was administered to 135 patients. The control group comprised 233 patients who received standard treatment. All patients (N = 368, median age 54 [range 15-82] years) had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and either moderate or severe COVID-19 disease. Results CCP treatment was significantly associated with a higher rate of clinical improvement in patients with moderate or severe disease. Among those with moderate COVID-19 disease, time to clinical improvement was 7 days in the CCP group versus 8 days in the control group (p = 0·006). For severe COVID-19 disease, time to clinical improvement was 7 days in the CCP group versus 15.5 days in the control group (p = 0·003). In the adjusted analysis, the CCP-treated patients with moderate disease had significantly lower 30-day mortality. Compared to the control group, oxygen saturation improved within 3 days of CCP transfusion, and lymphocyte counts improved from day 7 in patients with moderate disease and day 11 in patients with severe disease. Furthermore, C-reactive protein declined throughout the first 14 days after CCP transfusion. None of the CCP patients developed a serious transfusion reaction. Conclusions The data show that administration of CCP is a safe treatment option for patients with COVID-19 disease, with a favorable outcome in the rate and time to clinical improvement.","Alsharidah, Sondas; Ayed, Mariam; Ameen, Reem M.; Alhuraish, Fatma; Rouheldeen, Najat A.; Alshammari, Farah R.; Embaireeg, Alia; Almelahi, Mariam; Adel, Maitham; Dawoud, Mohammed E.; Aljasmi, Mohammad A.; Alshammari, Nashmi; Alsaeedi, Abdullah; Al-Adsani, Wasel; Arian, Hussan; Awad, Husain; Alenezi, Humoud A.; Alzafiri, Azeez; Gouda, Enas F.; Almehanna, Mohammad; Alqahtani, Salem; Alshammari, Abdulrahman; Askar, Medhat Z.",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220325133; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220325133?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33285283/,333

660784,Commentary: COVID-19: “There is no education like adversity”,2020-06-06,"Biomaterials are now being used or evaluated clinically as implants to supplement the severe shortage of available human donor organs. To date, however, such implants have mainly been developed as scaffolds to promote the regeneration of failing organs due to old age or congenital malformations. In the real world, however, infection or immunological issues often compromise patients. For example, bacterial and viral infections can result in uncontrolled immunopathological damage and lead to organ failure. Hence, there is a need for biomaterials and implants that not only promote regeneration but also address issues that are specific to compromised patients, such as infection and inflammation. Different strategies are needed to address the regeneration of organs that have been damaged by infection or inflammation for successful clinical translation. Therefore, the real quest is for multifunctional biomaterials with combined properties that can combat infections, modulate inflammation, and promote regeneration at the same time. These strategies will necessitate the inclusion of methodologies for management of the cellular and signaling components elicited within the local microenvironment. In the development of such biomaterials, strategies range from the inclusion of materials that have intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, such as the synthetic lipid polymer, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), to silver nanoparticles that have antibacterial properties, to inclusion of nano- and micro-particles in biomaterials composites that deliver active drugs. In this present review, we present examples of both kinds of materials in each group along with their pros and cons. Thus, as a promising next generation strategy to aid or replace tissue/organ transplantation, an integrated smart programmable platform is needed for regenerative medicine applications to create and/or restore normal function at the cell and tissue levels. Therefore, now it is of utmost importance to develop integrative biomaterials based on multifunctional biopolymers and nanosystem for their practical and successful clinical translation.","Griffith, May; Islam, Mohammad M.; Edin, Joel; Papapavlou, Georgia; Buznyk, Oleksiy; Patra, Hirak K.",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27668213/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2016.00071,333

Based on the promise for the rational design of vaccine platforms, the current review will provide an update on particle-based vaccines of both viral and synthetic origin, giving examples of recombinant virus carriers such as adenoviruses and biodegradable particulate carriers. The viral carriers carry pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), used by the original virus for targeting DC, and are particularly efficient and versatile gene delivery vectors. Efforts in the field of synthetic vaccine carriers are focussing on decorating the particle surface with ligands for DC receptors such as heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan structures, integrins, Siglecs, galectins, C-type lectins and toll-like receptors.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we included patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from 20th January 2020 to 15th March 2020. The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders.

This pandemic evolves in successive phases, i.e., phase 1 (the start phase), phase 2 (“the storm”), and phase 3 (the recession). To date, oncology and surgery groups have only given instructions for addressing phases 1 and 2. To prevent excess cancer mortality, health care systems (HCS) need to be restructured. Our aim is to detail the specificities of each epidemic phase and discuss several methods of organization to optimize cancer patient flow during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during phase 3. Hospitals must be reorganized in order to create a cancer hub that is free of infection, allowing for the safe treatment of patients. Hospital structures are different, but all allow for the creation of virus-free areas. Screening programs are critical and need to be applied to all people entering the virus-free zone, including health care workers. Some reorganization proposals are internal to a hospital, while others require interhospital collaboration. The heterogeneity and complexity of HCS will make interhospital management difficult. The ministry of health has an important role in managing the cancer crisis. Cancer management should be declared a priority. Oncological and surgical societies must coordinate their efforts to facilitate this prioritization. The anticipation of oncological management during phase 3 of the pandemic is necessary because it requires a complete readjustment of HCS. This adaptation should allow for the continuation of cancer care to prevent excess cancer mortality, as the virus will still be present for a currently undetermined period of time.","Tuech, Jean-Jacques; Gangloff, Alice; Di Fiore, Frederic; Benyoucef, Ahmed; Michel, Pierre; Schwarz, Lilian",Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000509650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683373/,333

It finds that the public subsidies and medical insurance reforms have improved the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals, while the coastal location and 3A class hospital proportion have decreased the cost efficiency of Chinese hospitals.

In multivariable regression of clinical and CT parameters, consolidation burden (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7, 6.9 per doubling; P = .001) and increasing GGO attenuation (OR, 3.2; 95% CI: 1.3, 8.3 per standard deviation, P = .02) were independent predictors of deterioration or death; as was C-reactive protein (OR, 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3, 3.4 per doubling; P = .004), history of heart failure (OR 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.6, P = .01), and chronic lung disease (OR, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6; P = .02). Quantitative CT measures added incremental predictive value beyond a model with only clinical parameters (area under the curve, 0.93 vs 0.82, P = .006). The optimal prognostic cutoffs for burden of COVID-19 pneumonia as determined by Youden’s index were consolidation of greater than or equal to 1.8% and GGO of greater than or equal to 13.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative burden of consolidation or GGO on chest CT independently predict clinical deterioration or death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. CT-derived measures have incremental prognostic value over and above clinical parameters, and may be useful for risk stratifying patients with COVID-19.","Grodecki, Kajetan; Lin, Andrew; Cadet, Sebastien; McElhinney, Priscilla A; Razipour, Aryabod; Chan, Cato; Pressman, Barry; Julien, Peter; Maurovich-Horvat, Pal; Gaibazzi, Nicola; Thakur, Udit; Mancini, Elisabetta; Agalbato, Cecilia; Menè, Roberto; Parati, Gianfranco; Cernigliaro, Franco; Nerlekar, Nitesh; Torlasco, Camilla; Pontone, Gianluca; Slomka, Piotr J; Dey, Damini",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778629/; https://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200389,333

METHODS: We measured antibodies in serum samples from 30,576 persons in Iceland, using six assays (including two pan-immunoglobulin [pan-Ig] assays), and we determined that the appropriate measure of seropositivity was a positive result with both pan-Ig assays. We tested 2102 samples collected from 1237 persons up to 4 months after diagnosis by a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay. We measured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed. RESULTS: Of the 1797 persons who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1107 of the 1215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive; antiviral antibody titers assayed by two pan-Ig assays increased during 2 months after diagnosis by qPCR and remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study. Of quarantined persons, 2.3% were seropositive; of those with unknown exposure, 0.3% were positive. We estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection was fatal in 0.3%. We also estimate that 56% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Iceland had been diagnosed with qPCR, 14% had occurred in quarantined persons who had not been tested with qPCR (or who had not received a positive result, if tested), and 30% had occurred in persons outside quarantine and not tested with qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not decline within 4 months after diagnosis. We estimate that the risk of death from infection was 0.3% and that 44% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Iceland were not diagnosed by qPCR.","Gudbjartsson, Daniel F.; Norddahl, Gudmundur L.; Melsted, Pall; Gunnarsdottir, Kristbjorg; Holm, Hilma; Eythorsson, Elias; Arnthorsson, Asgeir O.; Helgason, Dadi; Bjarnadottir, Kristbjorg; Ingvarsson, Ragnar F.; Thorsteinsdottir, Brynja; Kristjansdottir, Steinunn; Birgisdottir, Kolbrun; Kristinsdottir, Anna M.; Sigurdsson, Martin I.; Arnadottir, Gudny A.; Ivarsdottir, Erna V.; Andresdottir, Margret; Jonsson, Frosti; Agustsdottir, Arna B.; Berglund, Jonas; Eiriksdottir, Berglind; Fridriksdottir, Run; Gardarsdottir, Elisabet E.; Gottfredsson, Magnus; Gretarsdottir, Olafia S.; Gudmundsdottir, Steinunn; Gudmundsson, Kjartan R.; Gunnarsdottir, Thora R.; Gylfason, Arnaldur; Helgason, Agnar; Jensson, Brynjar O.; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Jonsson, Hakon; Kristjansson, Thordur; Kristinsson, Karl G.; Magnusdottir, Droplaug N.; Magnusson, Olafur T.; Olafsdottir, Lovisa B.; Rognvaldsson, Solvi; le Roux, Louise; Sigmundsdottir, Gudrun; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Sveinbjornsson, Gardar; Sveinsdottir, Kristin E.; Sveinsdottir, Maney; Thorarensen, Emil A.; Thorbjornsson, Bjarni; Thordardottir, Marianna; Saemundsdottir, Jona; Kristjansson, S.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of atypical pulmonary infections in patients with various types of immunosuppression, and to analyze clinical characteristics of these infections. Eighty non-HIV immunocompromised patients with different underlying diseases and clinical and radiological signs of pulmonary infection were enrolled. Due to incomplete data on eight patients, 72 patients were eligible for final analysis (median age 58 years). All patients underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) fluid samples were sent for direct microscopy, cultures, and fungal antigen detection, when appropriate. Commercial qualitative amplification assay (PNEUMOTRIS oligomix Alert Kit(®)), based on nested PCR method, was used to detect specific DNA sequences of L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae in BALF. There were 61 (84.7 %) patients with hematologic diseases, 3 (4.2 %) after solid organ transplantation, and 8 (11.1 %) with miscellaneous diseases affecting immune status. Specific sequences of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and L. pneumophila DNA were found in 7 (9.7 %), 2 (2.8 %), and 0 patients, respectively. In 8 of these patients co-infections with different microorganisms were demonstrated. Co-infection with A. baumanii and P. aeruginosa was diagnosed in three patients who died. We conclude that atypical lower airway infections are uncommon in immunocompromised patients. The majority of these infections are co-infections rather than single pathogen infections.","Grabczak, E.

The different variables affecting reporting (e.g., time delays in reporting) necessitates a well-documented reliability study examining the data methods and discussion of possible causes of differences between aggregators. Objective: To statistically evaluate the reliability of COVID-19 across aggregators. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cases and deaths were collected daily by volunteers via state and local health departments, as primary sources and newspaper reports, as secondary sources. In an effort to begin comparison for reliability statistical analysis, BroadStreet collected data from other COVID-19 aggregator sources, including USAFacts, Johns Hopkins University, New York Times, The COVID Tracking Project. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19 cases and death counts at the county and state levels. Results: Lower levels of inter-rater agreement were observed across aggregators associated with the number of deaths, which manifested itself in state level Bayesian estimates of COVID-19 fatality rates. Conclusions and Relevance: A national, publicly available data set is needed for current and future disease outbreaks and improved reliability in reporting.","Miller, A.

It is a complex process mediated by the coordinated engagement of multiple ZP receptors forming high-molecular-weight (HMW) protein complexes at the acrosomal region of the sperm surface. The present article aims to review the current understanding of sperm-ZP binding in the four most studied mammalian models, i.e., murine, porcine, bovine, and human, and summarizes the candidate ZP receptors with established ZP affinity, including their origins and the mechanisms of ZP binding. Further, it compares and contrasts the ZP structure and carbohydrate composition in the aforementioned model organisms. The comprehensive understanding of sperm-ZP interaction mechanisms is critical for the diagnosis of infertility and thus becomes an integral part of assisted reproductive therapies/technologies.","Tumova, Lucie; Zigo, Michal; Sutovsky, Peter; Sedmikova, Marketa; Postlerova, Pavla",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445482/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10010133,333

Before the release of its genome into the host cell cytoplasm, viruses operate a complex sequence of events that take place at the plasma membrane of the target cell. The first step is the binding of the HIV protein envelope (Env) to the cellular receptor CD4. This triggers conformational changes of the gp120 viral protein that allow its interaction with a co-receptor that can be either CCR5 or CXCR4, defining the tropism of the virus entering the cell. This sequential interaction finally drives the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane or to the endocytosis of the viruses. Here, we discuss how the membrane composition and organization of both the virus and the target cell can affect these steps and thus influence the capability of the viruses to infect cells.","Dumas, Fabrice; Preira, Pascal; Salomé, Laurence",Biochimie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193376/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908414002466; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2014.08.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908414002466,333

However, cysteines are found mostly in hydrophobic environments, either in S–S (disulphide) form or in free cysteine form. When free cysteines are found on the surface of proteins, they are often involved in catalytic residues, as in cysteine proteases, P-loop phosphatases, etc. Additionally, a unique property of cysteines is that their side-chain volume is different from all other amino acids. This study is focused on the discrimination between structural versus active free cysteines based on a local environment analysis which does not appear to have been attempted previously. We have demonstrated the corresponding structural positions associated with free cysteines in their three-dimensional localization environment. We examined protein samples including nine, sequenced, coronavirus proteases and cysteine-rich non-membrane proteins. Our present study shows that the sequential environments of free cysteines of coronavirus proteases are rather hydrophobic and that the free cysteines of non-membrane proteases have a higher amount of contacts to hydrophobic residues and lower amount of contacts to polar or charged residues.","Ho, Sheau Ling; Wang, Andrew H.-J.",J Taiwan Inst Chem Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288881/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtice.2008.07.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876107008001685; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876107008001685,333

A particular issue is the detection of genetically diverse pathogens, i.e. human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (HEV) which are frequent causes of FRI. Resequencing Pathogen Microarray technology has demonstrated potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously, but a high confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking. RESULTS: Using HRV and HEV as test cases, we assess a general design strategy for detecting and serotyping genetically diverse viruses. A minimal number of probe sequences (26 for HRV and 13 for HEV), which were potentially capable of detecting all serotypes of HRV and HEV, were determined and implemented on the Resequencing Pathogen Microarray RPM-Flu v.30/31 (Tessarae RPM-Flu). The specificities of designed probes were validated using 34 HRV and 28 HEV strains. All strains were successfully detected and identified at least to species level. 33 HRV strains and 16 HEV strains could be further differentiated to serotype level. CONCLUSION: This study provides a fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection and differential identification of genetically diverse RNA viruses with a minimal number of prototype sequences. The results demonstrated that the newly designed RPM-Flu v.30/31 can provide comprehensive and specific analysis of HRV and HEV samples which implicates that this design strategy will be applicable for other genetically diverse viruses.","Wang, Zheng; Malanoski, Anthony P; Lin, Baochuan; Kidd, Carolyn; Long, Nina C; Blaney, Kate M; Thach, Dzung C; Tibbetts, Clark; Stenger, David A",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19046445/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-577,333

COVID-19 is a viral respiratory tract disease that poses an increasing risk of infection through person-to-person transmission in a confined space or close proximity to an infected person. It is thus crucial to maintain a sufficiently safe distance from others during leisure activities. In this study, measures concerning leisure activity spaces and the current status of leisure activities were investigated. Data were gathered from a total of 1078 participants via an online survey conducted from 26 to 29 October 2020. Frequency analysis was performed to investigate the sample characteristics and exploratory factor analysis was performed to analyze the validity of the measurement tools. Results revealed that people’s perceived crowding of leisure activity spaces directly influenced their participation in leisure activities. Regarding age, those in their 20s were more aware of congestion and their risk perception was higher than those in their 40s and 50s. It was found that people perceived cultural and artistic activities to be dangerous as they often take place as part of tourism and leisure activities and amidst crowds. However, their high-risk perception indirectly influenced their participation patterns, making it difficult to enjoy leisure activities. To lower the risk perception of leisure activity spaces, it was necessary to secure more safe distancing than current regulations require. Future research must conduct a longitudinal investigation by objectively stratifying the degree of perceived crowding.","Kim, Young-Jae; Kang, Seung-Woo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33430042/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020457,333

People with physical disabilities might be particularly likely to be negatively affected, but evidence is scarce. Our aim was to evaluate the emotional and social experience of older people with physical disabilities during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Methods In this longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected in 2018–19 and June–July, 2020, from participants aged 52 years and older and living in England. Physical disability was defined as impairment in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and impaired mobility. Depression, anxiety, loneliness, quality of life, sleep quality, and amount of real-time and written social contact were assessed online or by computer-assisted telephone interviews. Comparisons of experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic of people with and without a physical disability were adjusted statistically for pre-pandemic outcome measures, age, sex, wealth, ethnicity, presence of a spouse or partner, number of people in the household, and chronic pain. All participants with full data available for both surveys were included in the analyses. Findings Between June 3 and July 26, 2020, 5820 participants responded, 4887 of whom had full data available for both the pre-pandemic measures and the COVID-19 survey and were included in the analysis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly more people with ADL impairment had clinically significant symptoms of depression (odds ratio 1·78 [95% CI 1·44–2·19]; p<0·0001), anxiety (2·23 [1·72–2·89]; p<0·0001), and loneliness (1·52 [1·26–1·84]; p<0·0001) than people without ADL impairment. Significantly more people with ADL impairment also had impaired sleep quality (1·44 [1·20–1·72]; p<0·0001) and poor quality of life than people without ADL impairment. The results were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility. People with ADL impairment had less frequent real-time contact (0·70 [0·55–0·89]; p=0·0037) and written social contact (0·54 [0·45–0·64]; p<0·0001) with family than people without ADL impairment. Results for social contact were similar when disability was defined by impaired mobility.

Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics of COVID‐19 patients remains limited. Herein, we collected blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HDs) and 38 COVID‐19 patients to analyse changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and their phenotypes. We observed that the lymphocyte percentage moderately decreased, CD4 and CD8 T cell percentage among lymphocytes were similar, and B cell percentage was increased in COVID‐19 patients in comparison to that in HDs. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD‐1. Importantly, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection increased the percentage of T follicular helper– and germinal centre B–like cells in the blood. The parameters in COVID‐19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells are activated naturally and are functional during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. These data provide evidence that the adaptive immunity in most patients could be primed to induce a significant immune response against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection upon receiving standard medical care.","Yang, Xiaofang; Dai, Tongxin; Zhou, Xiaobo; Qian, Hongbo; Guo, Rui; Lei, Lei; Zhang, Xingzhe; Zhang, Dan; Shi, Lin; Cheng, Yanbin; Hu, Jinsong; Guo, Yaling; Zhang, Baojun",J Cell Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975374/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.15771,333

The current study aims to explore whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are associated with the development of death in patients with COVID-19. A total of 131 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from 13 February 2020 to 14 March 2020 in a hospital in Wuhan designated for treating COVID-19 were enrolled in the current study. These 131 patients had a median age of 64 years old (interquartile range: 56–71 years old). Furthermore, among these patients, 111 (91.8%) patients were discharged and 12 (9.2%) patients died in the hospital. The pooled analysis revealed that the NLR at admission was significantly elevated for non-survivors, when compared to survivors (P < 0.001). The NLR of 3.338 was associated with all-cause mortality, with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 84.0% (area under the curve (AUC): 0.963, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.911–1.000; P < 0.001). In view of the small number of deaths (n = 12) in the current study, NLR of 2.306 might have potential value for helping clinicians to identify patients with severe COVID-19, with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 56.7% (AUC: 0.729, 95% CI 0.563–0.892; P = 0.063).

In the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with this improved Poly (I:C) derivative induced strong anti-SARS-CoV mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses with neutralizing activity against pseudotyped virus. Although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites, co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity. When intranasal immunization was used, PIKA was obligatorily for inducing neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites and was correlated with both mucosal IgA and mucosal IgG response. Overall, PIKA could be a good mucosal adjuvant candidate for inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine for use in possible future pandemic.","Gai, Wei-wei; Zhang, Yan; Zhou, Di-han; Chen, Yao-qing; Yang, Jing-yi; Yan, Hui-min",Virol Sin,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-011-3183-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21468931/,333

Although several mechanisms may explain the pathophysiology behind COVID-19 related syncope, a valid relationship has not been established yet. In this systematic review, we aimed to examine the current incidence of syncope in COVID-19 patients and to explore different patterns observed in this setting. Methods: A systematic review across PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and SCOPUS was performed, according to PRISMA guidelines, in order to identify all relevant articles regarding both COVID-19 and syncope. Results: We identified 81 publications, of which 62 were excluded. The cumulative incidence of syncope and pre-syncope across the selected studies was 7.1% (256/3584 patients). Unspecified syncope was the most common type (76.2% of the reported episodes), followed by reflex syncope (18.1% of the cases). Orthostatic hypotension was responsible for 3.6% of the cases and syncope of presumable cardiac cause accounted for 2.0%. Arterial hypertension was present in 64.7% of the patients and either angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used by 39.5% of hypertensive patients with syncope. Conclusion: Syncope, although not considered a typical symptom of the COVID-19 disease, can be associated with it, particularly in early stages. Different types of syncope were seen in this context, each with different implications requiring distinct approaches. A careful reevaluation of blood pressure whenever a patient develops COVID-19 is suggested, including reassessment of antihypertensive therapy.","Falcao de Freitas, R.; Torres, S. C.; Nunes, J. P.

Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in up to 70% of infected patients, and there is increasing evidence of human‐to‐human transmission. NiV is designated a priority pathogen in the NIAID Biodefense Research Agenda, and could be a devastating agent of agrobioterrorism if used against the pig farming industry. Endothelial syncytium is a pathognomonic feature of NiV infections, and is mediated by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins. This review summarizes what is known about the pathophysiology of NiV infections, and documents the identification of the NiV receptor. EphrinB2, the NiV and HeV receptor, is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons, consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV. We discuss how the identification of the henipahvirus receptor sheds light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and how it will spur the rational development of effective therapeutics. In addition, ephrinB3, a related protein, can serve as an alternative receptor, and we suggest that differential usage of ephrinB2 versus B3 may explain the variant pathogenic profiles observed between NiV and HeV. Thus, identifying the NiV receptors opens the door for a more comprehensive analysis of the envelope–receptor interactions in NiV pathobiology. Finally, we also describe how galectin‐1 (an innate immune defense lectin) can interact with specific N‐glycans on the Nipah envelope fusion protein, underscoring the potential role that innate immune defense mechanisms may play against emerging pathogens.","LEE, BENHUR",Ann N Y Acad Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17470911/,333

The potential importance of the microbiome in shaping both environmental health and disease makes investigations of microbiomes an excellent teaching tool for undergraduate microbiology. Here, we present a CURE based on the microbiome of the bean beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus), a model system for undergraduate laboratory education. Despite the extensive research literature on bean beetles, little is known about their microbiome, making them an ideal system for a discovery-based CURE. In the CURE, students acquire microbiological technical skills by characterizing both culturable and unculturable members of the beetle gut-microbial community. Students plate beetle gut homogenates on different media, describe the colonies that are formed to estimate taxonomic diversity, extract DNA from colonies of interest, PCR amplify the16S rRNA gene for Sanger sequencing, and use the NCBI-nBLAST database to taxonomically classify sequences. Additionally, students extract total DNA from beetle gut homogenates for high-throughput paired-end sequencing and perform bioinformatic and statistical analyses of bacterial communities using a combination of open-access data processing software. Each activity allows students to engage with studies of microbiomes in a real-world context, to apply concepts and laboratory techniques to investigate either student or faculty-driven research questions, and to gain valuable experiences working with large high-throughput datasets. The CURE is designed such that it can be implemented over either 6-weeks (half semester) or 12-weeks (full semester), allowing for flexibility within the curriculum. Furthermore, student-generated data from the CURE (including bacterial colony phenotypic data, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences from cultured isolates, and bacterial community sequences from gut homogenates) has been compiled in a continuously curated open-access database on the Bean Beetle Microbiome Project website, facilitating the generation of broader research questions across laboratory classrooms.","Zelaya, Anna J.; Gerardo, Nicole M.; Blumer, Lawrence S.; Beck, Christopher W.",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.577621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042093/,333

We reviewed the medical records of 42 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID‐19 from March 13, 2020, to March 29, 2020, when they were in their third trimester of pregnancy. They and their newborn infants were monitored until the infant was 1 month old. RESULTS: Over half (52.4%) of the women had a vaginal delivery. The initial clinical symptoms were coughing (66.6%) and fever (59.5%), and one mother died due to thrombo‐embolic events. We admitted 37 newborn infants to the neonatal unit (88%), and 28 were then admitted to intermediate care for organisational virus‐related reasons. No infants died, and no vertical transmission was detected during hospitalisation or follow‐up. Only six were exclusively breastfed at discharge. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of COVID‐19 transmission in any of the infants born to COVID‐19 mothers, and the post‐discharge advice seemed effective. The measures to avoid transmission appeared to reduce exclusive breastfeeding at discharge.","Marín Gabriel, Miguel A.; Cuadrado, Irene; Álvarez Fernández, Blanca; González Carrasco, Ersilia; Alonso Díaz, Clara; Llana Martín, Isabel; Sánchez, Laura; Olivas, Cristina; de las Heras, Susana; Criado, Enrique",Acta Paediatr,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649784/,333

Population genetic analysis could be useful for investigating the origin and evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19. However, due to extensive sampling bias and existence of infection clusters during the epidemic spread, direct applications of existing approaches can lead to biased parameter estimations and data misinterpretation. In this study, we first present robust estimator for the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and the mutation rate, and then apply the approach to analyze 12,909 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation rate is inferred to be 8.69 × 10(-4) per site per year with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [8.61 × 10(-4), 8.77 × 10(-4)], and the TMRCA of the samples inferred to be Nov 28, 2019 with a 95% CI of [Oct 20, 2019, Dec 9, 2019]. The results indicate that COVID-19 might originate earlier than and outside of Wuhan Seafood Market. We further demonstrate that genetic polymorphism patterns, including the enrichment of specific haplotypes and the temporal allele frequency trajectories generated from infection clusters, are similar to those caused by evolutionary forces such as natural selection. Our results show that population genetic methods need to be developed to efficiently detangle the effects of sampling bias and infection clusters to gain insights into the evolutionary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.

The survival and sustainable development of the online health community requires users to continuously disclose their health and privacy. Therefore, it is a great practical significance to find out the factors and mechanisms that promote users' self-disclosure in the online health community. From the perspective of individual and situation interaction, this study constructed influencing factors model of health privacy information self-disclosure. Finally, we collected 264 valid samples from the online health community through online and offline questionnaire surveys and then use the SPSS20.0 and AMOS21.0 to conduct exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, scale reliability and validity analysis, and structural equation model analysis. The main findings are as follows: trust in websites and trust in doctors reduce the privacy concern. The privacy trade-off will not occur when trust is enough to offset the privacy concerns caused by personalized services, reciprocity norms, and other factors. Second, reciprocity norms are inevitably compulsive, which will increase privacy concerns. However, based on voluntariness, reciprocity norms can enhance user trust. Third, service quality caused by personalized services not only enhance the social rewards of users but also eliminate the privacy concern. Fourth, users' health privacy attention and information sensitivity are too high to decrease the influence of user' privacy concerns on personal health privacy information disclosure. The conclusions of this paper will help us to supplement privacy calculus theory and the application scope of the attention-based view.

Detecting lung cancer is challenging due to nonspecific symptom presentation. Literature was reviewed to consider functional decline as an indicator for ill-health. This study explored the process experienced from recognition in a change of health to receiving a lung cancer diagnosis from a patient’s perspective in order to examine this phase through a biopsychosocial lens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-case design methodology was used for this study. The method of data collection was semi-structured interviews with people diagnosed with lung cancer utilizing criterion sampling. The case study was bound by diagnostic and geographical factors to frame the single-case: participants were limited to those living in Alaska diagnosed with stage III or stage IV lung cancer. RESULTS: One (n = 1) person participated in this study. Themes consistent with lung cancer detection process from a patient’s perspective include symptom denial, symptom reductionism, and gradual impact on function. CONCLUSION: Although the number of participants was extremely limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the time of recruitment, this case study suggests a decline in function present prior to being diagnosed with lung cancer. Opportunities exist within the provider and patient interface to promote earlier detection include educating medical providers to ask specific, closed-ended, non-disease related functional questions to ascertain more details and a holistic representation of patients’ health. Raising public awareness of lung cancer symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea, is also warranted.","Kowalski, Lesleigh",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948085/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s295498,333

Lower respiratory illnesses are more likely to occur in specific high risk groups, including infants, and children and adults with asthma. The relationships between rates of infection and the risk of clinical illness and exacerbation are not completely understood. Recent studies employing polymerase chain reaction and other molecular techniques indicate that there are new branches on the HRV family tree, and one characteristic of recently detected viruses is that they cannot be detected by standard tissue culture.

It displays broad-spectrum virucidal activity in the presence of UV light and has been shown to be effective in inactivating various viruses in blood products prior to transfusions. In addition, its use has been validated for methemoglobinemia and malaria treatment. In this study, we first evaluated the virucidal activity of methylene blue against influenza virus H1N1 upon different incubation times and in the presence or absence of light activation, and then against SARS-CoV-2. We further assessed the therapeutic activity of methylene blue by administering it to cells previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we examined the effect of co-administration of the drug together with immune serum. Our findings reveal that methylene blue displays virucidal preventive or therapeutic activity against influenza virus H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and in the absence of UV-activation. We also confirm that MB antiviral activity is based on several mechanisms of action as the extent of genomic RNA degradation is higher in presence of light and after long exposure. Our work supports the interest of testing methylene blue in clinical studies to confirm a preventive and/or therapeutic efficacy against both influenza virus H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Cagno, Valeria; Medaglia, Chiara; Cerny, Andreas; Cerny, Thomas; Zwygart, Arnaud Charles-Antoine; Cerny, Erich; Tapparel, Caroline",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253743/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92481-9,333

Objective biomarkers for early risk stratification and clinical management are still lacking. The aim of this work was to determine whether bioactive adrenomedullin can assist in the risk stratification and clinical management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Fifty-three patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this prospective observational cohort study between March and April 2020. Bioactive adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) plasma concentration was measured daily for seven days after admission. The prognostic value and clinical significance of bio-ADM plasma levels were evaluated for the severity of respiratory failure, the need for extracorporeal organ support and outcome (28-day mortality). Bio-ADM levels increased with the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; p < 0.001) and were significantly elevated in invasively ventilated patients (p = 0.006) and patients in need of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (p = 0.040) or renal replacement therapy (RRT; p < 0.001) compared to patients without these conditions. Non-survivors showed significantly higher bio-ADM levels than survivors (p = 0.010). Bio-ADM levels predicted 28-day mortality (C-index 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.56–0.87, p < 0.001). Bio-ADM plasma levels correlate with disease severity, the need for extracorporeal organ assistance, and outcome, and highlight the promising value of bio-ADM in the early risk stratification and management of patients with COVID-19.","Simon, Tim-Philipp; Stoppe, Christian; Breuer, Thomas; Stiehler, Lara; Dreher, Michael; Kersten, Alexander; Kluge, Stefan; Karakas, Mahir; Zechendorf, Elisabeth; Marx, Gernot; Martin, Lukas",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924637/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10081667,333

AoD commonly presents with either sudden onset chest pain or back pain, with systemic hypertension being the most significant predisposing risk factor. We report an atypical presentation and unfortunate misdiagnosis of aortic dissection during the COVID-19 pandemic that could further improve this patient population's screening and outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59 year old male with a history of hypertension was transferred to our institution for Neurosurgery evaluation due to head CT results consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Repeated images revealed normal findings. Upon arrival, he presented with blood pressure readings of 252/110 mmHg accompanied by altered mental status. Further questioning of the patient's spouse revealed the patient's non-compliance with his antihypertensives, and abuse of energy drinks (> 4 drinks/day). In addition she revealed that symptoms began one day prior to admission, as the patient stood in the living room and reported an intense, non-localized headache accompanied by loss of sensation in lower extremities and loss of consciousness. Physical examination was remarkable for obesity, drowsiness, epigastric tenderness, and no focal neurologic deficits. The patient was admitted with an initial diagnostic impression of hypertensive emergency with the CNS as target for which Clevidipine drip was started. Given the marked clinical deterioration 48 hours after admission consisting of an elevated temperature, tachycardia, and leukocytosis during the COVID-19 pandemic led to suspicion, PCR testing and isolation. The PCR was non-reactive. Portable Chest X-Ray report yielded a magnification of cardiomediastinal silhouette with mediastinal widening. Subsequent chest and abdominal/pelvic CT confirmed the suspected diagnosis of AoD. Cardiology and Endovascular Surgery were consulted for further management. Recommendations were given against surgical management. After 35 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged in a stable condition. DISCUSSION: AoD are caused by a tear in the aortic intima creating a false lumen. Despite the rarity of AoD, it has typical findings. Pain, most commonly in the chest and back, is present in over 90% of AoD patients, all of which were absent in our patient. Transient neurological symptoms including altered mentation;and elevated blood pressure readings, must be evaluated for aortic dissection when risk factors are present despite concurrent inflammatory responses amid a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A new pandemic and the surrounding uncertainty can influence but most not be allowed to sway other differential diagnoses. It is of utmost importance to recognize atypical presentations in high risk populations in order to obtain better outcomes. REFERENCE #1: Astarita A, Covella M, Vallelonga F, et al.

Several theories about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been proposed. While Betacoronavirus found in Rhinolophus bats from China have been broadly implicated, their genetic dissimilarity to SARS-CoV-2 is so high that they are highly unlikely to be its direct ancestors. Thus, an intermediary host is suspected to link bat to human coronaviruses. Based on genomic CpG dinucleotide patterns in different coronaviruses from different hosts, it was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have evolved in a canid gastro-intestinal tract prior to transmission to humans. However, similar CpG patterns are now reported in coronaviruses from other hosts, including bats themselves and pangolins. Therefore, reduced genomic CpG alone is not a highly predictive biomarker, suggesting a need for additional biomarkers to reveal intermediate hosts or tissues.

These issues are exacerbated by limited access to diagnostic and research facilities throughout the country. Nepal has one of the highest COVID-19 case rates (915 cases per 100,000 people) in South Asia, with densely-populated Kathmandu experiencing the highest number of cases. Swiftly identifying case clusters and introducing effective intervention programs is crucial to mounting an effective containment strategy. The rapid identification of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants can also provide important information on viral evolution and epidemiology. Genomic-based environmental surveillance can help in the early detection of outbreaks before clinical cases are recognized, and identify viral micro-diversity that can be used for designing real-time risk-based interventions. This research aimed to develop a genomic-based environmental surveillance system by detecting and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples of Kathmandu using portable next-generation DNA sequencing devices. Out of 20 selected sites in the Kathmandu Valley, sewage samples from 16 (80%) sites had detectable SARS-CoV-2. A heat-map was created to visualize transmission activity in the community based on viral load intensity and corresponding geospatial data. Further, 41 mutations were observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Some detected mutations (n=9, 2%) were novel and yet to be reported in the global database, with one indicating a frameshift deletion in the spike gene. We also observed more transition than transversion on detected mutations, indicating rapid viral evolution in the host.

Creating awareness and understanding patient concerns will play an important role in protecting this vulnerable group in developing timely and appropriate healthcare interventions. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 23(rd) March 2020 & 1(st) April 2020 among 154 liver transplant recipients, transplanted between October 2018 and February 2020. An 18-point questionnaire explored their knowledge of COVID-19, awareness of recipient’s high-risk status, interventions to minimize cross-infections and concerns of this patient group regarding the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 112 (73%) respondents, with median age of 53 years (81% males). There was no difference in demographics between those who responded (n=112), to those who did not respond to the survey (n=42). Most of the recipients were aware of the main symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever (92%), breathlessness (86%), dry cough (87%), but less than half were aware of diarrhea (39%) as a symptom. Awareness about spread from asymptomatic individuals was limited (26%). Majority (95%) understood their high-risk status, but worryingly 23% of the respondents felt that there was no risk in visiting the hospital for routine clinic visit and blood tests. Concerns were raised by the recipients mostly regarding the uncertainties of COVID-19 infection and its treatment options, the quality of information on social messaging platforms and lack of access to routine tests/immunosuppression levels due to lockdown/social distancing.

However, many licenced and recommended vaccines for this age group show signs of waning of the protective effect due to declining immune responses (immuno-senescence) and decreasing vaccine uptake. Today’s major challenge is to improve vaccine effectiveness and uptake and to deploy efficient vaccination strategies for this age group. The Vaccines and InfecTious diseases in the Ageing popuLation (VITAL) project, with partners from 17 academic & research groups and public institutes as well as seven industry collaborators, aims to address this challenge. The ambition is to provide evidence-based knowledge to local decision makers. Using a holistic and multidisciplinary approach and novel analytical methods, VITAL will provide tools that allow the development of targeted immunisation programs for ageing adults in European countries. The project is based on four pillars focussing on the assessment of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases in ageing adults, the dissection of the mechanisms underlying immuno-senescence, the analysis of the clinical and economic public health impact of vaccination strategies and the development of educational resources for healthcare professionals. By the end of the project, a clear, detailed, and integrated program should be available for implementing a consistent, affordable, and sustainable vaccination strategy for ageing adults with regular evaluations of its impact over time.","Van Baarle, Debbie; Bollaerts, Kaatje; Del Giudice, Giuseppe; Lockhart, Stephen; Luxemburger, Christine; Postma, Maarten J.; Timen, Aura; Standaert, Baudouin",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713682/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20309051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20309051,333

Recent reports quantifying the extent by which VOC can evade vaccine immunity resulted in a range of estimates for the same VOC, which makes them difficult to interpret. One possible explanation for the discrepancies between different studies is an inconsistency in terms of the time post-vaccination of the sampled population. Here we present a model based on the observed correlation between antibody neutralization levels and vaccine efficacy, which demonstrates the impact of time post-vaccination on the comparison of the vaccine efficacy for VOC versus non-VOC infections. Our model predicts and exemplifies several possible consequences for vaccine efficacy in VOC infections: 1) a delay in the onset of vaccine efficacy against VOC; 2) a transient increase in susceptibility to breakthrough infection with VOC compared to non-VOC as a function of time after vaccination. We review preliminary data indicating that such phenomena are observed in studies of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. We find that ignoring the strong dependence on the time post-vaccination can lead to contradictory reports of relative efficacy against VOC versus non-VOC, with implications on mitigation strategies against VOC and the design of vaccine efficacy studies.","Bar-On, Y.

COVID-19 may further spread through municipal solid waste (MSW), if it is collected, handled, transported, or disposed in an improper way. The current paper provides an overview of the multiple challenges that COVID-19 has introduced to the various tasks of MSW management including the impact of the implemented precautionary measures on MSW management, priorities and hierarchy of MSW, direct impact on the constitution, and characterization of MSW in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, based on waste management characterization guidance. In addition, specific and alternative guidance plans for the potential critical points of the infection were suggested to protect public health during the pandemic. The results of the current study revealed that the hierarchical system of MSW was modified under pandemic conditions. Implementation of control measures in Makkah has led to a change of lifestyle, which resulted in a physical change of the MSW constitution in Makkah, with the following average rates: organic matter, 57%; plastics, 31%; paper and cardboard, 9%; metals, 1%; glass, 1%; and wood, 1%. In conclusion, a specific guidance plan for MSW management during the COVID-19 pandemic was developed, aimed at handlers, pickers, collection, transportation, transfer stations, and MSW disposal. Such a guidance plan may play a vital role in controlling the pandemic, especially in the outdoor environment. The suggested guidance plan describes and specifies structured and ordered practices of MSW management in Makkah during COVID-19 and other pandemics.","Osra, Faisal; Morsy, Essam A.; Abd El-Rahim, Ibrahim H.A.",Arab J Geosci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-021-07990-8,333

In this context, leaders have faced a trade-off between imposing stringent measures to limit the contagion, and minimizing the short-run costs on their national economy, which could impact their electoral prospects. Leveraging on both the timing of elections and the constitutional term limits faced by leaders in presidential systems, we document how incumbents who can run for re-election implement less stringent restrictions when the election is closer in time. The effect is driven by measures more likely to have a negative economic impact.

These proteins are primarily considered to be DNA binding transcription factors; however, owing to the diverse array of zinc-finger domains, they are able to interact with molecules other than DNA like RNA, proteins, lipids and PAR (poly-ADP-ribose). Evidences from recent scientific studies have provided an insight into the potential functions of zinc finger proteins in immune system regulation both at the transcriptional and post transcriptional level. However, the mechanism and importance of zinc finger proteins in the regulation of immune response is not very well defined and understood. This review highlights in detail the importance of zinc finger proteins in the regulation of immune system at transcriptional and post transcriptional level.

While a handful of actions can help reduce pathogen transmission, one critical behavior is to self-isolate. Public health messages often use persuasive language to change attitudes and behaviors, which can evoke a wide range of negative and positive emotional responses. In a U.S. representative sample (N = 955), we presented two messages that leveraged either threatening or prosocial persuasive language, and measured self-reported emotional reactions and willingness to self-isolate. Although emotional responses to the interventions were highly heterogeneous, personality traits known to be linked with distinct emotional experiences (extraversion and neuroticism) explained significant variance in the arousal response. While results show that both types of appeals increased willingness to self-isolate (Cohen's d = 0.41), compared to the threat message, the efficacy of the prosocial message was more dependent on the magnitude of the evoked emotional response on both arousal and valence dimensions. Together, these results imply that prosocial appeals have the potential to be associated with greater compliance if they evoke highly positive emotional responses.","Heffner, Joseph; Vives, Marc-Lluís; FeldmanHall, Oriel",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920306115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082614/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920306115; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110420,333

The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to this swift and widespread transition to digital health and education. However, the need for digital health competencies goes beyond the COVID-19 pandemic because they are becoming essential for the delivery of effective, efficient, and safe care. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to collate and analyze studies evaluating digital health education for medical students to inform the development of future courses and identify areas where curricula may need to be strengthened. METHODS: We carried out a scoping review by following the guidance of the Joanna Briggs Institute, and the results were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We searched 6 major bibliographic databases and gray literature sources for articles published between January 2000 and November 2019. Two authors independently screened the retrieved citations and extracted the data from the included studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussions between the authors. The findings were analyzed using thematic analysis and presented narratively. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies focusing on different digital courses were included in this review. Most of the studies (22/34, 65%) were published between 2010 and 2019 and originated in the United States (20/34, 59%). The reported digital health courses were mostly elective (20/34, 59%), were integrated into the existing curriculum (24/34, 71%), and focused mainly on medical informatics (17/34, 50%). Most of the courses targeted medical students from the first to third year (17/34, 50%), and the duration of the courses ranged from 1 hour to 3 academic years. Most of the studies (22/34, 65%) reported the use of blended education. A few of the studies (6/34, 18%) delivered courses entirely digitally by using online modules, offline learning, massive open online courses, and virtual patient simulations. The reported courses used various assessment approaches such as paper-based assessments, in-person observations, and online assessments. Most of the studies (30/34, 88%) evaluated courses mostly by using an uncontrolled before-and-after design and generally reported improvements in students’ learning outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health courses reported in literature are mostly elective, focus on a single area of digital health, and lack robust evaluation. They have diverse delivery, development, and assessment approaches. There is an urgent need for high-quality studies that evaluate digital health education.","Tudor Car, Lorainne; Kyaw, Bhone Myint; Nannan Panday, Rishi S; van der Kleij, Rianne; Chavannes, Niels; Majeed, Azeem; Car, Josip",JMIR Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.2196/28275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287206/,333

We have therefore reviewed and analyzed the literature with respect to a possible increased risk of infection for patients during treatment in the GHG. On the one hand the climatic and physical conditions in the GHG can be viewed as hostile to viruses and on the other hand the mild radon hyperthermia and the geographic location of the GHG lead to positive effects on the patient’s health via complex physiological processes.

Bioelectrical impedance-based methods are non-invasive and widely applied but need to be validated for their use in young patients with obesity. (2) Methods: We compiled data from three independent studies on children and adolescents with obesity, measuring body composition with two bioelectrical impedance-based devices (TANITA and BIACORPUS). For a small patient group, additional data were collected with air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). (3) Results: Our combined data on 123 patients (age: 6–18 years, body mass index (BMI): 21–59 kg/m²) and the individual studies showed that TANITA and BIACORPUS yield significantly different results on body composition, TANITA overestimating body fat percentage and fat mass relative to BIACORPUS and underestimating fat-free mass (p < 0.001 for all three parameters). A Bland–Altman plot indicated little agreement between methods, which produce clinically relevant differences for all three parameters. We detected gender-specific differences with both methods, with body fat percentage being lower (p < 0.01) and fat-free mass higher (p < 0.001) in males than females. (4) Conclusions: Both bioelectrical impedance-based methods provide significantly different results on body composition in young patients with obesity and thus cannot be used interchangeably, requiring adherence to a specific device for repetitive measurements to ascertain comparability of data.","Thajer, Alexandra; Skacel, Gabriele; Truschner, Katharina; Jorda, Anselm; Vasek, Martin; Horsak, Brian; Strempfl, Johanna; Kautzky-Willer, Alexandra; Kainberger, Franz; Greber-Platzer, Susanne",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920492/; https://doi.org/10.3390/children8040295,333
686614,Potential impact of COVID-19 in people living with HIV: experience from previous 21st century coronaviruses epidemics,2020-06-10,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread in other countries in December 2019. The infected patients presented with fever, respiratory symptoms, sometimes with digestive and other systemic manifestations, and some progressed with a severe acute respiratory syndrome or even death. Associated digestive symptoms were frequently observed in the patients, with an unknown significance and mechanism. ACE2, as the major known functional receptor of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) attracted our attention. We collected the clinical data of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients from published studies and extracted the data about the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, we used online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs, especially in the small intestine, to explore the relationship between ACE2 expression patterns and clinical symptoms. We found that diarrhea accounted for a notable proportion of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 8.0% to 12.9%. The results reveal that ACE2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the small intestinal enterocytes but not in the goblet cells or intestinal immune cells. High expression of ACE2 on the surface cells in the digestive tract may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation susceptibility. Overall, digestive symptoms were common in the COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression on surface cells of the small intestine may mediate the invasion and amplification of the virus and activation of gastrointestinal inflammation. It is a possible mechanism of digestive symptoms in the COVID-19 patients and explains the presence of the virus in patients’ stool samples. The study also highlights the necessity of taking stool samples for suspected patients to help in early diagnosis and assessment of disease status.","Zhang, Hui; Li, Hong-Bao; Lyu, Jian-Rui; Lei, Xiao-Ming; Li, Wei; Wu, Gang; Lyu, Jun; Dai, Zhi-Ming",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311451/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302381; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302381?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.027,333

The aim is to identify hot-spot sites where a bifurcation can alter the local topology of the protein backbone. Since the shape of a protein is intimately related to its biological function, a substitution that causes a bifurcation should have an enhanced capacity to change the protein’s function. The methodology applies to any protein but it is developed with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a timely example. First, topological criteria are introduced to identify and classify potential bifurcation hot-spot sites along the protein backbone. Then, the expected outcome of asubstitution, if it occurs, is estimated for a general class of hot-spots, using a comparative analysis of the surrounding backbone segments. The analysis combines the statistics of structurally commensurate amino acid fragments in the Protein Data Bank with general stereochemical considerations. It is observed that the notorious D614G substitution of the spike protein is a good example of a bifurcation hot-spot. A number of topologically similar examples are then analyzed in detail, some of them are even better candidates for a bifurcation hot-spot than D614G. The local topology of the more recently observed N501Y substitution is also inspected, and it is found that this site is proximal to a different kind of local topology changing bifurcation.","Peng, Xubiao; Niemi, Antti J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591922/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257886,333

While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical services, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The developed tool was validated by comparing the estimated overall vulnerability with the real-time reported normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19. ANALYSIS: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. In order to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. RESULTS: All of the 5 vulnerability categories, as well as the overall vulnerability, showed significant (P-values <<0.05) and relatively strong correlations (0.203<ρ<0.57) with the normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the census tract level. Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45–65 (~4% of County’s population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk. CONCLUSION: Policymakers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.","Kiaghadi, Amin; Rifai, Hanadi S.; Liaw, Winston",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119721/,333

The patient and clinician experience of video outpatient consultation during the peak of the pandemic was studied for acceptability and to gather recommendations to improve the service during continuing infection control measures. Methods Outpatient video telemedicine was introduced over a 14-day period including the provision of equipment, systems integration and stakeholder communication. Patient and clinician experience were measured between 15 April 2020 and 5 May 2020. Results A total of 43 patients and 79 clinicians provided feedback. Of the patients, 86% were above the age of 30 years, with the largest patient group aged 51-70 years. Patient experience was positive. All (100%) patients found joining the video consultation easy; 93% of them recommended to use it for future consultations. Clinician satisfaction was >90% with sound and video quality. Patients were less satisfied than clinicians in that they had communicated everything they wanted to (86% versus 95%). All (100%) patients thought that the video telemedicine solution met their needs, but 25% of clinicians believed that the patient experience of a video consultation was worse than a face-to-face clinic appointment. The three significant factors identified for introducing video consultations were successful IT, improved patient experience and digital healthcare records.

690072,Assessment of Pediatric Outpatient Visits for Notifiable Infectious Diseases in a University Hospital in Beijing During COVID-19,2020-08-24,"In the grip of a pandemic of proportions that have not been seen for generations, some have proposed conducting “human challenge” vaccine trials in which healthy volunteers are deliberately infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Such trials might substantially speed up the search for a safe and effective vaccine and save many thousands of lives. I argue that such trials are not only permissible, but given reasonable assumptions, they are morally required, subject to some important caveats.","Kolber, Adam J",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728467/,333
