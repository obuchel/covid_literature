65218,Pediatric Life Support: 2020 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations.,2020-10-20,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified to be the causative agent of SARS with atypical pneumonia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the major receptor for SARS-CoV. It is not clear whether ACE2 conveys signals from the cell surface to the nucleus and regulates expression of cellular genes upon SARS-CoV infection. To understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, human type II pneumocyte (A549) cells were incubated with the viral spike protein or with SARS-CoV virus-like particles containing the viral spike protein to examine cytokine modulation in lung cells. Results from oligonucleotide-based microarray, real-time PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays indicated an upregulation of the fibrosis-associated chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) by the viral spike protein and the virus-like particles. The upregulation of CCL2 by SARS-CoV spike protein was mainly mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and AP-1 but not the IkappaBalpha-NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In addition, Ras and Raf upstream of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway were involved in the upregulation of CCL2. Furthermore, ACE2 receptor was activated by casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation in cells pretreated with the virus-like particles containing spike protein. These results indicate that SARS-CoV spike protein triggers ACE2 signaling and activates fibrosis-associated CCL2 expression through the Ras-ERK-AP-1 pathway.","Chen, I-Yin; Chang, Shin C; Wu, Hung-Yi; Yu, Ting-Chun; Wei, Wen-Chin; Lin, Shiming; Chien, Chung-Liang; Chang, Ming-Fu",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02560-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484496/,870
65845,2020 International Consensus on First Aid Science With Treatment Recommendations.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND Although guidelines recommend systemic therapy even in patients with limited extrahepatic metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a few recent studies suggested a potential benefit for resection of extrahepatic metastases. However, the benefit of adrenal resection (AR) for adrenal-only metastases (AOM) from HCC was not proved yet. This is the first study to compare long-term outcomes of AR to those of sorafenib in patients with AOM from HCC. METHODS The patients with adrenal metastases (AM) from HCC were identified from the electronic records of the institution between January 2002 and December 2018. Those who presented AM and other sites of extrahepatic disease were excluded. Furthermore, the patients with AOM who received other therapies than AR or sorafenib were excluded. RESULTS A total of 34 patients with AM from HCC were treated. Out of these, 22 patients had AOM, 6 receiving other treatment than AR or sorafenib. Eventually, 8 patients with AOM underwent AR (AR group), while 8 patients were treated with sorafenib (SOR group). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were not significantly different in terms of age, sex, number and size of the primary tumor, timing of AM diagnosis, Child-Pugh and ECOG status. After a median follow-up of 15.5 months, in the AR group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates (85.7%, 42.9%, and 0%, respectively) were significantly higher than those achieved in the SOR group (62.5%, 0% and 0% at 1-, 3- and 5-year, respectively) (P = 0.009). The median progression-free survival after AR (14 months) was significantly longer than that after sorafenib therapy (6 months, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS In patients with AOM from HCC, AR was associated with significantly higher overall and progression-free survival rates than systemic therapy with sorafenib. These results could represent a starting-point for future phase II/III clinical trials.","Alexandrescu, Sorin T; Croitoru, Adina E; Grigorie, Razvan T; Tomescu, Dana R; Droc, Gabriela; Grasu, Mugur C; Popescu, Irinel",Hepatobiliary & pancreatic diseases international : HBPD INT,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hbpd.2020.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917528/,870

92441,Part 7: Neonatal Resuscitation: 2015 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations (Reprint).,2015,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence of burnout among Danish and American urologists. METHODS An email invitation was sent with two reminders spaced by 14 days intervals to members of the Danish Urological Association and urologists at the University of Michigan to participate in a survey consisting of the two item Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Burnout was defined as reporting ""once a week"", ""a few times a week"" or ""everyday"" on either the emotional exhaustion or depersonalization domains of the MBI. Two open-ended questions were added to the survey for the Danish urologists, these were then qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis. Categorial variables were compared using Chi square analysis. RESULTS The response rate was 193/387 (49.9%) for the Danish urologists and 43/64 (67.12%) among American urologists. The prevalence of burnout for the American and Danish cohorts was identified in 4 (44.4%) of the American residents and 10 (32.3%) of the American attendings compared to 2 (3%) of Danish residents and 16 (12.7%) of Danish attendings. The difference in rate of burnout between Danish residents and attendings was statistically significant (p=0.03). Burnout was statistically significantly different between American and Danish residents (p<0.01) and attendings (p<0.01). There was a statistically significant difference in rates of burnout between American and the Danish female urologists (p=0.02) and similarly among male urologists (p<0.01). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated low rates of burnout among Danish urologists and a significant difference in burnout between residents and attendings from Michigan compared to Danish residents and attendings.","Jacobsen, Frederik M; Jensen, Christian Fuglesang S; Schmidt, Mette L K; Qin, Yongmei; Akselberg, Nicholas John; Sønksen, Jens; Ohl, Dana A; Stork, Brian R",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2020.07.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916191/,870

However, depressive symptoms can be seen in other psychiatric and medical conditions. Here, we investigate the effect of DHEA treatment on depressive symptoms in individuals with depression and/or other clinical conditions in which depressive symptoms are present. An electronic search was performed until October 2019, with no restrictions on language or year of publication in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DHEA versus placebo were included if the depressive symptoms were assessed. Fifteen studies with 853 female and male individuals were included in this review. To conduct the meta-analysis, data were extracted from 14 studies. In comparison with placebo, DHEA improved depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.28, 95% (CI) -0.45 to -0.11, p =.001, 12 studies, 742 individuals (375 in the experimental group and 367 in the placebo group), I2 = 24%), very low quality of evidence, 2 of 14 studies reporting this outcome were removed in a sensitivity analysis as they were strongly influencing heterogeneity between studies. No hormonal changes that indicated any risk to the participants' health were seen. Side effects observed were uncommon, mild, and transient, but commonly related to androgyny. In conclusion, DHEA was associated with a beneficial effect on depressive symptoms compared to placebo. However, these results should be viewed with caution, since the quality of evidence for this outcome was considered very low according to the GRADE criteria.","Peixoto, Clayton; José Grande, Antonio; Gomes Carrilho, Carolina; Egidio Nardi, Antonio; Cardoso, Adriana; Barciela Veras, André",Journal of neuroscience research,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32930419/,870

In the case of Escherichia coli inducible promoters, our incomplete understanding of the relationship between sequence composition and gene expression hinders our ability to predictably control transcriptional responses. Here, we profile the expression dynamics of 8269 rationally designed, IPTG-inducible promoters that collectively explore the individual and combinatorial effects of RNA polymerase and LacI repressor binding site strengths. We then fit a statistical mechanics model to measured expression that accurately models gene expression and reveals properties of theoretically optimal inducible promoters. Furthermore, we characterize three alternative promoter architectures and show that repositioning binding sites within promoters influences the types of combinatorial effects observed between promoter elements. In total, this approach enables us to deconstruct relationships between inducible promoter elements and discover practical insights for engineering inducible promoters with desirable characteristics.","Yu, Timothy C; Liu, Winnie L; Brinck, Marcia S; Davis, Jessica E; Shek, Jeremy; Bower, Grace; Einav, Tal; Insigne, Kimberly D; Phillips, Rob; Kosuri, Sriram; Urtecho, Guillaume",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20094-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33436562/,870

We examined actual daily healthcare utilization from stroke onset to 1 year afterward from the ESCAPE trial (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Time) and registry data. Methods- We examined patients from Alberta, Canada, that was enrolled into the ESCAPE trial and the Quality Improvement and Clinical Research registry in the 2016/2017 fiscal year. Through data linkages to several administrative data sets, the daily location of each patient was assessed in various healthcare settings. Results- A total of 286 patients were analyzed, 52 patients were in the treatment arm, and 47 patients were in the control arm of the ESCAPE trial while 187 patients received endovascular therapy as usual care (2016/2017 fiscal year). The odds of a patient being out of a healthcare setting over 1 year was significantly higher when they received endovascular therapy: 3.46 (1.68-7.30) in ESCAPE trial patients and 2.00 (1.08-3.75) in the Quality Improvement And Clinical Research patients. Conclusions- Endovascular therapy significantly reduces healthcare utilization up to 1 year after a stroke.","Kamal, Noreen; Rogers, Edwin; Stang, Jillian; Mann, Balraj; Butcher, Kenneth S; Rempel, Jeremy; Jeerakathil, Thomas; Shuaib, Ashfaq; Goyal, Mayank; Menon, Bijoy K; Demchuk, Andrew M; Hill, Michael D",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.024870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31154945/,870

METHODS We enrolled 52 severely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Among them, 12 cases progressed to critical illness. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of severely and critically ill patients were compared. RESULTS Compared with the severely ill patients, critically ill patients had higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as higher levels of D-dimer, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (all P<0.05). Before treatment, the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were significantly higher in the critically ill patient's group [(10.23±3.71) mmol/L] compared to those in the severely ill patients [(7.12±3.35) mmol/L, P<0.05]. After adjusting for age, gender, and course of the disease, fasting blood glucose at admission (OR=1.308, 95% CI 1.066 to 1.606, P=0.01) and hyperglycemia at admission (OR=29.198, 95% CI 2.903 to 293.639, P=0.004) were closely related to whether severely ill patients progressed to critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019. In our study, 15 (34.8%) of the severely ill and 10 (83.3%) critically ill patients received the steroid treatment. Compared with the severely ill patients, the FPG levels in critically ill patients were higher (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Fasting hyperglycemia at admission is a significant predictor for the prognosis of severely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Closely monitoring and the optimal management of hyperglycemia may improve the prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.","Liu, Zuoliang; Liu, Shengping; Wang, Zhifei; Liu, Chun; Long, Feiyan; Jin, Ping",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

145194,AJPH Global News.,2017,"BACKGROUND In order to avoid microaspiration and tracheal injury, the target for endotracheal tube cuff pressure is 20 to 30 cm H2O. OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of changes in body position on cuff pressure in adult patients. METHODS Twelve orally intubated and sedated patients received neuromuscular blockers and were positioned in a neutral starting position (backrest, head-of-bed elevation 30º, head in neutral position) with cuff pressure at 25 cm H2O. Then, 16 changes in position were performed: anteflexion head, hyperextension head, left and right lateral flexion of head, left and right rotation of the head, semirecumbent position (head-of-bed elevation 45°), recumbent position (head-of-bed elevation 10°), horizontal backrest, Trendelenburg position (10°), and left and right lateral positioning over 30°, 45°, and 90°. Once a patient was correctly positioned, cuff pressure was recorded during an end-expiratory ventilatory hold. The pressure observed was compared with the cuff pressure at the starting position. Values outside the target range (20-30 cm H2O) were considered clinically relevant. RESULTS A total of 192 measurements were performed (12 subjects × 16 positions). A significant deviation in cuff pressure occurred with all 16 changes (P < .05). No pressures were less than the lower limit (20 cm H2O). Pressures were greater than the upper limit (30 cm H2O) in 40.6% of the measurements. In each position, the upper target limit was exceeded at least once. Within-patient variability was substantial (P = .02). CONCLUSION Simple changes in patients' positioning can result in potentially harmful cuff pressures.","Lizy, Christelle; Swinnen, Walter; Labeau, Sonia; Poelaert, Jan; Vogelaers, Dirk; Vandewoude, Koenraad; Dulhunty, Joel; Blot, Stijn","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2014489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24382623/,870

The cDNA clones representing the 3'-terminal genomic RNA of the virus were isolated and sequenced. The genome is a positive-stranded, polyadenylated RNA with an estimated size of 15 kb. Analysis of the resulting sequence identified three complete open reading frames (ORFs) with the potential to encode polypeptides with predicted M(r)s of 22.2K (ORF 5), 19.1K (ORF 6) and 13.6K (ORF 7). ORF 7, which is closest to the 3' end, is predicted to encode a highly basic nucleocapsid protein displaying 58% amino acid identity to the corresponding protein of the Lelystad virus (LV), a European PRRSV isolate. ORFs 6 and 5, preceding ORF 7, are each predicted to encode proteins containing several hydrophobic domains that are thought to be membrane-associated. The VR 2385 ORF 6 protein is the most conserved structural protein. It has 78% amino acid identity to the equivalent LV protein, and ORF 5 shares only 54% of its amino acid sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed a 3'-coterminal nested set of six subgenomic RNAs in VR 2385 virus-infected CRL 11171 cells. Our results indicate that VR 2385, like LV, is a member of the newly proposed arterivirus group. However, the striking genetic variation and the difference in pathogenicity between LV and VR 2385 suggest that the viruses causing PRRS in the U.S.A. and Europe are highly variable and they may represent different genotypes.","Meng, X J; Paul, P S; Halbur, P G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8021610/,870

Several large, well-publicized outbreaks of foodborne disease have heightened public awareness that harmful microorganisms may be present in food and that chronic as well as acute disease may be caused by foodborne microbes. The field of food microbiology has likewise experienced a resurgence of interest. New tools, such as recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technology and monoclonal antibody production, used to elucidate microbial virulence factors have facilitated identification of disease-causing microbes once thought to be harmless and demonstrated the complexity of individual virulence mechanisms previously considered to be well understood. Foodborne pathogens are also causing disease via some surprising food vectors, such as chopped, bottled garlic and sauteed onions. In addition to acute gastrointestinal disturbances, certain microorganisms may, through complex interactions with the human immune response, cause chronic diseases that affect several major organ systems. These microbes are serving as models in studies of molecular mimicry and genetic interrelatedness of procaryotes and eucaryotes. Other recently recognized attributes of foodborne microorganisms, such as the heat shock phenomenon and the possible nonculturability of some bacteria, may affect their ability to cause disease in humans. Because foodborne disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, the study of these diseases and their causative microorganisms presents a unique challenge to many professionals in the subdisciplines of microbiology, epidemiology, and clinical medicine.","Archer, D L; Young, F E",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3069199/,870

Porcine cell lines supported Ad5 replication, showing virus titers, kinetics of virus production, and luciferase expression levels similar to those obtained in human 293 cells, which constitutively express the 5'-end 11% of the Ad5 genome. The tropism of Ad5-based vectors in swine and its ability to induce an efficient immune response against heterologous antigens expressed by foreign genes inserted in these vectors has been determined. Ad5 vectors replicate and express heterologous antigens in porcine lungs and mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes. Significant levels of heterologous antigen expression were also demonstrated in the small intestine (jejunum and ileum), but Ad5 replication in this organ was very poor, suggesting that Ad vectors undergo an abortive replication in the porcine small intestine. The tissues infected by Ad5 were dependent on the inoculation route. The oronasal route appeared to be best for inoculation of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue infection, while the intraperitoneal route was best for gut-associated lymphoid tissue infection. Epithelial cells of bronchioles, macrophages, type II pneumocytes, and follicular dendritic cells were identified as targets for Ad5, while epithelial cells of the intestine were not infected by Ad5. Viruses with a deletion from 79.5 to 84.8 map units in the E3 region, with or without heterologous inserted genes, replicated to lower levels in porcine tissues than did wild-type Ad5. It was also shown that an Ad5 recombinant expressing the four antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D) of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) spike protein induced in swine immune responses which neutralized TGEV infectivity. In addition, porcine serum from Ad-TGEV-immune animals provide passive protection when mixed with fully virulent TGEV and orally administered to highly susceptible newborn piglets. These results taken together indicate that swine may be a good animal model for human Ad5 lung infection to aid in the evaluation of candidate adenovirus vaccines and that Ad5 may be suitable as a recombinant viral vaccine or for other applications in swine.","Torres, J M; Alonso, C; Ortega, A; Mittal, S; Graham, F; Enjuanes, L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8648712/,870

In this study we showed that when RNA transcripts that consisted of a non-MHV sequence and the packaging signal were expressed in MHV-infected cells, they were packaged into MHV particles. Those RNA transcripts that lacked the packaging signal or those containing a mutated packaging signal did not package efficiently. Thus, the presence of the packaging signal was sufficient for RNA packaging into MHV particles.","Woo, K; Joo, M; Narayanan, K; Kim, K H; Makino, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8985424/,870

METHODS A survey of the 17 FLR hospitals was conducted via e-mail during the period of June 2007 to August 2007. RESULTS A total of 13 of 17 hospitals responded for a response rate of 76.5%. Only 23.1% of responding hospitals stockpile antiviral drugs. Vaccination rates for personnel with patient contact ranged from 36.8% to 76.1%. CONCLUSIONS Hospitals in the FLR have insufficient quantities of antiviral agents stockpiled to provide for the protection of health care workers, and influenza vaccination rates for health care workers are low. To ensure that a high level of care is maintained during a pandemic, health care workers need to be provided with appropriate protection. This can be accomplished if hospitals stockpile antiviral agents designated for the treatment and prophylaxis of health care workers with patient contact and their families.","Schneider, Ruth B; Benitez, John G; D'Angelo, Anne; Tyo, Kathee",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20389196/,870

195621,AJPH Global News.,2016,"Since the first recorded case of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh on 8th March 2020, COVID-19 has spread widely through different regions of the country, resulting in a necessity to re-evaluate the delivery of cardiovascular services, particularly procedures pertaining to interventional cardiology in resource-limited settings. Given its robust capacity for human-to-human transmission and potential of being a nosocomial source of infection, the disease has specific implications on healthcare systems and health care professionals faced with performing essential cardiac procedures in patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The limited resources in terms of cardiac catheterization laboratories that can be designated to treat only COVID positive patients are further compounded by the additional challenges of unavailability of widespread rapid testing on-site at tertiary cardiac hospitals in Bangladesh. This document prepared for our nation by the Bangladesh Society of Cardiovascular Interventions (BSCI) is intended to serve as a clinical practice guideline for cardiovascular health care professionals, with a focus on modifying standard practice of care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ensure continuation of adequate and timely treatment of cardiovascular emergencies avoiding hospital-based transmission of SARS-COV-2 among healthcare professionals and the patients. This is an evolving document based on currently available global data and is tailored to healthcare systems in Bangladesh with particular focus on, but not limited to, invasive cardiology facilities (cardiac catheterization, electrophysiology & pacing labs). This guideline is limited to the provision of cardiovascular care, and it is expected that specific targeted pharmaco-therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 be prescribed as stipulated by the National Guidelines on Clinical Management of Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) published by the Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh.","Uddin, M J; Rahman, A F; Rahman, S; Momenuzzaman, N M; Rahman, A; Majumder, A S; Mohibullah, A M; Chowdhury, A H; Malik, F N; Ahsan, S A; Mohsin, K; Haq, M M; Chowdhury, A W; Sohrabuzzaman, A M; Rahman, M; Chakraborty, B; Rahman, R; Khan, S R; Khan, K N; Reza, A M; Hussain, K S; Rashid, M; Choudhury, A K; Karmakar, K K; Ali, Z; Alam, N; Rahman, Z; Kabir, C S; Banik, D; Dutta, A; Badiuzzaman, M; Islam, A W; Sium, A H; Hossain, M D; Ahmed, N; Jahan, J; Islam, M S; Arefin, M M; Cader, F A; Banerjee, S K; Hoque, H; Shofiuddin, M; Selim, A; Das, P K; Ahmed, M; Dutto, B; Alam, S; Paul, G K; Paul, S K; Azam, M G",Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32506111/,870

Thus, the gamification approach embedded in modular instruction in education is integrated by making each lesson interactive through progress trackers and badges in every game-based related activities to the lessons that have been used to sustain and enhance students’ motivation and learning engagement in the modular setup through a conducted Randomized Block Research Design. In this paper, the objectives were to (1) determine the profile of the students in terms of the type of institution they belong to, sex, age, degree program, and the course they were enrolled in the 2nd Semester A.Y. 2019-2020. Second (2) it determined the assessment of the module in terms of three areas such as format, content, and gamified features of the module. It also (3) tested the significant difference of the mean assessment of the module when grouped according to profile so that the educators will know how to contextualize the gamified module for its possible improvement. Notwithstanding, the concluded integration of the aspects of the module in terms of the format, content, and gamified features were all highly received positively by the 279 purposive-conveniently sampled respondents who participated from a local college in Laguna and a state university in Manila from the College of Education. The format, content, and gamified features of the module were all with high regards, however, with some notable remarks including the module cover, color, and template, insufficiency of the illustrative examples, and the improvement of progress tracker, badges, incentive system, and the game-based activities related to the lessons. Also, there is no statistical difference in the perceived use of the gamified module in many areas implied that there is a consistent presentation of the three areas whether in the different institution, age brackets, sex orientation, year levels, degree program, and course taken except those of the format since education courses were oriented to instructional materials standards gave them the ability to assess it more comprehensively. Another significant assessment was traced to content and gamified features of the males since males are more exposed to games perhaps lead them the expectations to a more similar approach to the games they were exposed to. The study recommended that though they find the gamified module as an innovative tool and unique way of learning amid the pandemic, improvements in terms of the badges, the activities presented in the module, and some additional features of the real game such as real and more creative badges, leaderboards and incentive system.

The therapeutic management of the patients with chronic respiratory diseases and COVID-19 is similar to the other patients but the post-recovery course could be worse in this population and followed by the development of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary hypertension. The pandemic highly impacted our usual medical activities by limiting the access to several diagnosis procedures, the necessity to develop new methods for the monitoring of the disease and adapt the therapeutic strategies.

However, neuropsychological assessment is not usually included as routine practice in alcohol rehabilitation programs. The aim of this study was to describe qualitatively the cognitive deficits in early-detoxified AUD patients undergoing rehabilitation and to explore relevant associations with socio-demographic, clinical and psychological factors. Patients and Methods: Forty-one patients with a diagnosis of AUD were consecutively recruited from a residential rehabilitation hospital in Northern Italy. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Brief Neuropsychological Examination 2 (ENB-2). Anxiety, depression and severity of alcohol dependence were also evaluated using validated self-report questionnaires. Alcohol relapse was investigated 1 month after discharge. Results: Overall, 31.7% of AUD patients showed cognitive impairments according to the global score scale. However, 70.7% had an impaired performance on at least one test of the ENB-2, with particular regard to executive function, visuospatial and memory domains. Age, education and abstinence at admission were the most relevant factors associated with cognitive deficits in this clinical population. Conclusion: The detection of cognitive impairments is essential in order to adapt alcohol rehabilitation treatment to patients with cognitive deficits and enhance clinical outcomes.","Caneva, Stefano; Ottonello, Marcella; Torselli, Elisa; Pistarini, Caterina; Spigno, Paola; Fiabane, Elena",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,,870

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that is associated with a relatively high rate of severe lung disease and mortality. The mortality is particularly high in those with certain comorbidities and increases with age. Recently, several companies have developed an effective vaccination against COVID-19. Although the reported frequency of severe side effects is low, there is an emerging discussion about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with severe allergies and mastocytosis. However, even in these patients, severe adverse reactions are rare. We therefore recommend the broad use of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with mastocytosis on a global basis. The only well-established exception is a known or suspected allergy against a constituent of the vaccine. Safety measures, including premedication and postvaccination observation, should be considered in all patients with mastocytosis, depending on the individual personal risk and overall situation in each case.

403361,[Acute care during the first corona wave. Minor health damage for patients without covid-19 in a Dutch hospital],2021,"Importance: Nursing home residents are at heightened risk for morbidity and mortality following an exposure to a disaster such as a hurricane or the COVID19 pandemic. Previous research has shown that nursing home resident mortality related to disasters is frequently underreported. There is a need to better understand the consequences of disasters on nursing home residents and to differentiate vulnerability based on patient characteristics. Objective: To evaluate mortality and morbidity associated with exposure to Hurricane Irma, a Category 4 storm that made landfall on September 10, 2017, in Cudjoe Key, Florida, among short-stay (<90-day residence) and long-stay (&#8805;90-day residence) residents of nursing homes. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study of Florida nursing home residents comparing residents exposed to Hurricane Irma in September 2017 to a control group of residents residing at the same nursing homes over the same time period in calendar year 2015. Data were analyzed from August 28, 2019, to July 22, 2020. Exposure: Residents who experienced Hurricane Irma were considered exposed; those who did not were considered unexposed. Main Outcome and Measures: Outcome variables included 30-day and 90-day mortality and first hospitalizations after the storm in both the short term and the long term. Results: A total of 61â¯564 residents who were present in 640 Florida nursing home facilities on September 7, 2017, were identified. A comparison cohort of 61â¯813 residents was evaluated in 2015. Both cohorts were mostly female (2015, 68%; 2017, 67%), mostly White (2015, 79%; 2017, 78%), and approximately 40% of the residents in each group were over the age of 85 years. Compared with the control group in 2015, an additional 262 more nursing home deaths were identified at 30 days and 433 more deaths at 90 days. The odds of a first hospitalization for those exposed (vs nonexposed) were 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13) within the first 30 days after the storm and 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02-1.08) at 90 days; the odds of mortality were 1.12 (95% CI, 1.05-1.18) at 30 days and 1.07 (95% CI, 1.03-1.11) at 90 days. Among long-stay residents, the odds of mortality for those exposed to Hurricane Irma were 1.18 (95% CI, 1.08-1.29) times those unexposed and the odds of hospitalization were 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04-1.18) times those unexposed in the post 30-day period. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that nursing home residents are at considerable risk to the consequences of disasters. These risks may be underreported by state and federal agencies. Long-stay residents, those who have resided in a nursing home for 90 days or more, may be most vulnerable to the consequences of hurricane disasters.","Dosa, David M; Skarha, Julianne; Peterson, Lindsay J; Jester, Dylan J; Sakib, Nazmus; Ogarek, Jessica; Thomas, Kali S; Andel, Ross; Hyer, Kathryn",JAMA Netw Open,,870

405268,AJPH Global News,2020,"BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease; however, it is infrequently considered for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) attributable to infectious causes. We aimed to describe the course of disease and early post-transplantation outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who failed to show lung recovery despite optimal medical management and were deemed to be at imminent risk of dying due to pulmonary complications. METHODS: We established a multi-institutional case series that included the first consecutive transplants for severe COVID-19-associated ARDS known to us in the USA, Italy, Austria, and India. De-identified data from participating centres-including information relating to patient demographics and pre-COVID-19 characteristics, pretransplantation disease course, perioperative challenges, pathology of explanted lungs, and post-transplantation outcomes-were collected by Northwestern University (Chicago, IL, USA) and analysed. FINDINGS: Between May 1 and Sept 30, 2020, 12 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS underwent bilateral lung transplantation at six high-volume transplant centres in the USA (eight recipients at three centres), Italy (two recipients at one centre), Austria (one recipient), and India (one recipient). The median age of recipients was 48 years (IQR 41-51); three of the 12 patients were female. Chest imaging before transplantation showed severe lung damage that did not improve despite prolonged mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The lung transplant procedure was technically challenging, with severe pleural adhesions, hilar lymphadenopathy, and increased intraoperative transfusion requirements. Pathology of the explanted lungs showed extensive, ongoing acute lung injury with features of lung fibrosis. There was no recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the allografts. All patients with COVID-19 could be weaned off extracorporeal support and showed short-term survival similar to that of transplant recipients without COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The findings from our report show that lung transplantation is the only option for survival in some patients with severe, unresolving COVID-19-associated ARDS, and that the procedure can be done successfully, with good early post-transplantation outcomes, in carefully selected patients.

Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a human protease required for SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral entry and may represent such a target. We hypothesized that drugs selected from proteins related by their tertiary structure, rather than their primary structure, were likely to interact with TMPRSS2. We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool named 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Several candidate compounds, avoralstat, PCI-27483, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays. Avoralstat, a clinically tested kallikrein-related B1 inhibitor, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human airway epithelial cells. In an in vivo proof of principle, avoralstat significantly reduced lung tissue titers and mitigated weight loss when administered prophylactically to mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, indicating its potential to be repositioned for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prophylaxis in humans.","Sun, Young Joo; Velez, Gabriel; Parsons, Dylan E; Li, Kun; Ortiz, Miguel E; Sharma, Shaunik; McCray, Paul B; Bassuk, Alexander G; Mahajan, Vinit B",J. clin. invest,,870
436187,COVID-19: Preventive measures are effective to a certain extent. [Dutch],2020,"BACKGROUND: An association between IL-6 levels and cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19 patients has been suggested. Cases with higher IL-6 levels have more rapid progression and a higher complication rate. On the other hand, COVID-19 cases with anosmia have a milder course of the disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between serum IL-6 levels and presence of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on laboratory (PCR) were stratified into two groups based on presence of olfactory dysfunction (OD). In all cases with and without anosmia; psychophysical test (Sniffin' Sticks test) and a survey on olfactory symptoms were obtained. Threshold (t) - discrimination (d) - identification (i), and total (TDI) scores reflecting olfactory function were calculated. Clinical symptoms, serum IL-6 levels, other laboratory parameters, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were included, comprising 23 patients with anosmia and 36 patients without OD based on TDI scores. Patients with anosmia (41.39 ± 15.04) were significantly younger compared to cases without anosmia (52.19 ± 18.50). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of comorbidities, smoking history, and symptoms including nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. Although serum IL-6 levels of all patients were above normal values (7 pg/mL), patients with anosmia had significantly lower serum IL-6 levels (16.72 ± 14.28 pg/mL) compared to patients without OD (60.95 ± 89.33 pg/mL) (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 related anosmia tend to have significantly lower serum levels of IL-6 compared to patients without OD, and the lower IL-6 levels is related to milder course of the disease. With the effect of low cytokine storm and IL-6 level, it may be said that anosmic cases have a milder disease in COVID-19.","Sanli, Deniz Esin Tekcan; Altundag, Aytug; Kandemirli, Sedat Giray; Yildirim, Duzgun; Sanli, Ahmet Necati; Saatci, Ozlem; Kirisoglu, Ceyda Erel; Dikensoy, Oner; Murrja, Edvin; Yesil, Atakan; Bastan, Serdar; Karsidag, Tamer; Akinci, Ibrahim Ozkan; Ozkok, Sezen; Yilmaz, Eren; Tuzuner, Filiz; Kilercik, Meltem; Ljama, Taner",Am J Otolaryngol,,870

The NAb levels against the wild type (WA1/2020), Delta, and Kappa variants were measured and compared. Depending on each individuals medical condition and vaccination status, the NAb levels for most of the fully vaccinated people decreased within 2-6 months, while a small number of individuals either generated non-detectable amount of NAbs after full vaccination (e.g., immunocompromised), or had high NAb levels lasting beyond 6 months. Since the NAb levels vary significantly among different individuals and decrease over time, the deployment of a low-cost rapid test to monitor NAb levels against both the wild type and emerging variants among fully vaccinated individuals can play a very crucial role to control the current pandemic. Our study provides an example of using such a rapid NAb test to fill this currently unmet medical need.","Pan, Jing; Li, Zhigang; Wang, Lin; Szymanski, Joshua; Romano, Maria; Yin, Dylan; Wang, Allen; Small, Thomas; Zou, Zhiying; Li, Jing; Witham, Greg; Wang, Li; Zhang, Yubei; Qi, Kai; Yin, Ray",,,870

The development of a vaccine is challenging. We aimed to determine the proportion of people who intend to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in France or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous on-line survey from the 26th of March to the 20th of April 2020. Primary endpoints were the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was available or participate in a vaccine clinical trial. RESULTS: Three thousand two hundred and fifty nine individuals answered the survey; women accounted for 67.4% of the respondents. According to their statements, 2.512 participants (77.6%, 95% CI 76.2-79%) will certainly or probably agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, being a healthcare worker and individual perceived risk were associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with a decrease in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. One thousand and five hundred and fifty respondents (47.6% 95% CI 45.9-49.3%) will certainly or probably agree to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Older age, male gender, being a healthcare worker and individual perceived risk were associated with potential acceptance to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with refusal for participation in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 75% and 48% of the survey respondents were respectively likely to accept vaccination or participation in a clinical trial against COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy will be the major barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","Detoc, Maëlle; Bruel, Sébastien; Frappe, Paul; Tardy, Bernard; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Gagneux-Brunon, Amandine",Vaccine,,870

489448,AJPH Global News,2021,"Influenza A virus (IAV) activates ZBP1-initiated RIPK3-dependent parallel pathways of necroptosis and apoptosis in infected cells. Although mice deficient in both pathways fail to control IAV and succumb to lethal respiratory infection, RIPK3-mediated apoptosis by itself can limit IAV, without need for necroptosis. However, whether necroptosis, conventionally considered a fail-safe cell death mechanism to apoptosis, can restrict IAV-or indeed any virus-in the absence of apoptosis is not known. Here, we use mice selectively deficient in IAV-activated apoptosis to show that necroptosis drives robust antiviral immune responses and promotes effective virus clearance from infected lungs when apoptosis is absent. We also demonstrate that apoptosis and necroptosis are mutually exclusive fates in IAV-infected cells. Thus, necroptosis is an independent, ""stand-alone"" cell death mechanism that fully compensates for the absence of apoptosis in antiviral host defense.","Shubina, Maria; Tummers, Bart; Boyd, David F; Zhang, Ting; Yin, Chaoran; Gautam, Avishekh; Guo, Xi-Zhi J; Rodriguez, Diego A; Kaiser, William J; Vogel, Peter; Green, Douglas R; Thomas, Paul G; Balachandran, Siddharth",J. exp. med,,870

This study investigated the contribution of morbidities and related prescribed medications to COVID-19 associated mortality. Methods: Based on the various recently reported clinical scenarios a theoretical framework was designed to shed light on the mode of infection of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 and possible management options. Results: Dopamine-release mechanisms in the central nervous system may play a major role in the entry and propagation of coronaviruses. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the need for a thorough and urgent investigation of the dopamine-release pathways in the central nervous system.

In order to determine the appropriacy of this method for immunodiagnostic assays, the single-chain antibody (ScFv) against the hepatitis B virus (HBV) preS2 surface protein and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) envelope protein (SCVe) were fused to the SBD, then directly immobilized on PHA-coated slides via microspotting. The fluorescence-labeled HBV antigen and the antibody against SCVe were then utilized to examine specific interactions on the PHA-coated surfaces. Fluorescence signals were detected only at the spotted positions, thereby indicating a high degree of affinity and selectivity for their corresponding antigens/antibodies. Furthermore, we detected small amounts of ScFv-SBD (2.7 ng/mL) and SCVe-SBD fusion proteins (0.6 ng/mL). Therefore, this microarray platform technology, using PHA and SBD, appears generally appropriate for immunodiagnosis, with no special requirements with regard to synthetic or chemical modification of the biomolecules or the solid surface.","Park, Tae Jung; Park, Jong Pil; Lee, Seok Jae; Hong, Hyo Jeong; Lee, Sang Yup",Biotechnol Bioprocess Eng,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02931904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218672/,870

Determining the fundamental biology of viral variants and understanding their evolutionary trajectories will guide current mitigation measures, future genetic surveillance and vaccination strategies. Here we examine virus entry by the B.1.1.7 lineage, commonly referred to as the UK/Kent variant. Pseudovirus infection of model cell lines demonstrate that B.1.1.7 entry is enhanced relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain, particularly under low expression of receptor ACE2. Moreover, the entry characteristics of B.1.1.7 were distinct from that of its predecessor strain containing the D614G mutation. These data suggest evolutionary tuning of spike protein function. Additionally, we found that amino acid deletions within the N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike were important for efficient entry by B.1.1.7. The NTD is a hotspot of diversity across sarbecoviruses, therefore, we further investigated this region by examining the entry of closely related CoVs. Surprisingly, Pangolin CoV spike entry was 50–100 fold enhanced relative to SARS-CoV-2; suggesting there may be evolutionary pathways by which SARSCoV-2 may further optimise entry. Swapping the NTD between Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that changes in this region alone have the capacity to enhance virus entry. Thus, the NTD plays a hitherto unrecognised role in modulating spike activity, warranting further investigation and surveillance of NTD mutations.","Dicken, Samuel J.; Murray, Matthew J.; Thorne, Lucy G.; Reuschl, Ann-Kathrin; Forrest, Calum; Ganeshalingham, Maaroothen; Muir, Luke; Kalemera, Mphatso D.; Palor, Machaela; McCoy, Laura E.; Jolly, Clare; Towers, Greg J.; Reeves, Matthew B.; Grove, Joe",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791702/,870

We conducted a cross-sectional study of quality-controlled water testing (January–June 2018). In STP effluents, mean bacterial counts (colony-forming units/100 mL) had reduced E. coli (99.9% reduction; 102,266,667 to 710), A. hydrophila (98.8%; 376,333 to 9603), and P. aeruginosa (99.5%; 5,666,667 to 1550). Antibiotic resistance was significantly reduced for tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, and ceftazidime and increased for gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and imipenem. The highest levels were for amoxicillin/clavulanate (50–97%) and aztreonam (33%). Bacterial counts increased by 98.8% downstream compared to the sewage outfall and were predominated by E. coli, implying intense fecal contamination from other sources. There was a progressive increase in antibiotic resistance from upstream, to outfall, to downstream. The highest resistance was for amoxicillin/clavulanate (80–83%), cefuroxime (47–73%), aztreonam (53%), and ciprofloxacin (40%).

687767,Part 1: Executive summary(): 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations,2010-10-16,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to lead not only to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but also can result in thromboembolic events in both the venous and the arterial circulation by inducing coagulation disorders. The potential causes of coagulopathy are inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. The thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis as well as intracatheter thrombosis are more likely to develop in patients infected with severe form of SARS-CoV-2 who are admitted to ICU. Furthermore, these events contribute to multi-organ failure. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of an immunocompromised COVID-19 elderly patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia who developed myocardial infarction with ST elevation in the setting of acute pulmonary thromboembolism in the presence of zero platelet count. Despite successful urgent coronary revascularization and platelet transfusion, the patient eventually died after failed resuscitation efforts. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 infection are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular complications, but their appropriate management can decrease the risk of fatal events. Coronary thrombosis associated with pulmonary thromboembolism in the setting of thrombocytopenia is a rare and a complex to manage condition. Significance of single antiplatelet agent in STEMI with thrombocytopenia merits further studies. According to expert opinions and literature reviews, we must avoid dual antiplatelet therapy in these patients and keep platelet transfusion as a standard therapy to avoid drastic bleeding complications.","Hashemi, Arash; Gerges, Fady; Naqvi, Haseeb Raza; Kotlar, Irina; Moscatelli, Sara; Hashemi, Ashkan; Rustamova, Yasmin; Almaghraby, Abdallah",Egypt Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932169/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43044-021-00162-9,870
