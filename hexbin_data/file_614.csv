11456,Evidence-based impact by clinical engineers on global patients outcomes,2019-07-02,"PURPOSE: Chlamydia psittaci infection in humans can lead to serious clinical manifestations, including severe pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and, rarely, death. Implementation of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) gives a promising new tool for diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of severe psittacosis pneumonia is described to provide physicians with a better understanding and to highlight the rarity and severity of severe psittacosis pneumonia. METHODS: Nine cases of severe psittacosis pneumonia were diagnosed using mNGS. Retrospective analysis of the data on disease progression, new diagnosis tool, treatments, and outcomes, and the findings were summarised. RESULTS: Frequent symptoms included chills and remittent fever (100%), cough and hypodynamia (100%), and headache and myalgia (77.8%). All patients were severe psittacosis pneumonia developed respiratory failure, accompanied by sepsis in 6/9 patients. mNGS takes 48–72 h to provide the results, and help to identify diagnosis of psittacosis. Laboratory data showed normal or slightly increased leucocytes, neutrophils, and procalcitonin but high C-reactive protein levels. Computed tomography revealed air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity, which began in the upper lobe of one lung, and spread to both lungs, along with miliary, nodular, or consolidated shadows. One patient died because of secondary infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the other eight patients experienced complete recoveries. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mNGS can improve accuracy and reduce the delay in diagnosis of psittacosis. Severe psittacosis pneumonia responds well to the timely use of appropriate antibiotics.","Chen, Xiancheng; Cao, Ke; Wei, Yu; Qian, Yajun; Liang, Jing; Dong, Danjiang; Tang, Jian; Zhu, Zhanghua; Gu, Qin; Yu, Wenkui",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223968/,614

16055,Evidence for use of damage control surgery and damage control interventions in civilian trauma patients: a systematic review,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND: The complexity of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) techniques continues to evolve. Different cannulation methods and configurations have been proposed as a response to a challenging cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology of the patients. The use of parallel ECMO circuits represents a unique and novel approach for patients with refractory respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse with very large body surface areas. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 25-year-old morbidly obese male patient admitted for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxemia, requiring institution of double cannulation for veno-venous ECMO. Since his hypoxemia persisted, likely due to insufficient flows given his large body surface area, an additional drainage venous cannula was implemented to provide higher flows, temporarily addressing his oxygenation status. Unfortunately, the patient developed concomitant cardiogenic shock refractory to inotropic support and extracorporeal fluid removal, further worsening his oxygenation status, thus the decision was to institute four-cannulation/parallel-circuits veno-venous and veno-arterial ECMO, successfully controlling both refractory hypoxemia and cardiogenic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrates a novel and complex approach for combined severe ARDS and cardiovascular collapse through the use of parallel veno-venous and veno-arterial ECMO circuits, and exemplifies the expansion of ECMO techniques and its life-saving capabilities when conservative approaches are futile.","Navas-Blanco, Jose R.; Lifgren, Sofia A.; Dudaryk, Roman; Scott, Jeffrey; Loebe, Matthias; Ghodsizad, Ali",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7952814/,614
16150,The Effectiveness of Osseodensification Drilling Protocol for Implant Site Osteotomy: A Systematic Review of the Literature and Meta-Analysis,2021-02-28,"Diaphragm muscle dysfunction is increasingly recognized as an important element of several diseases including neuromuscular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diaphragm dysfunction in critically ill patients. Functional evaluation of the diaphragm is challenging. Use of volitional maneuvers to test the diaphragm can be limited by patient effort. Non-volitional tests such as those using neuromuscular stimulation are technically complex, since the muscle itself is relatively inaccessible. As such, there is a growing interest in using imaging techniques to characterize diaphragm muscle dysfunction. Selecting the appropriate imaging technique for a given clinical scenario is a critical step in the evaluation of patients suspected of having diaphragm dysfunction. In this review, we aim to present a detailed analysis of evidence for the use of ultrasound and non-ultrasound imaging techniques in the assessment of diaphragm dysfunction. We highlight the utility of the qualitative information gathered by ultrasound imaging as a means to assess integrity, excursion, thickness, and thickening of the diaphragm. In contrast, quantitative ultrasound analysis of the diaphragm is marred by inherent limitations of this technique, and we provide a detailed examination of these limitations. We evaluate non-ultrasound imaging modalities that apply static techniques (chest radiograph, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), used to assess muscle position, shape and dimension. We also evaluate non-ultrasound imaging modalities that apply dynamic imaging (fluoroscopy and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging) to assess diaphragm motion. Finally, we critically review the application of each of these techniques in the clinical setting when diaphragm dysfunction is suspected.

This retrospective study recruited 64 patients with aphasia. Mild/moderate and severe aphasia were classified according to cut-off Aphasia Quotient score of 51 points. Diffusion tensor imaging and fractional anisotropy reconstructed Language-Related White Matter in multiple fasciculi. We determined the area under the covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic curve to evaluate the accuracy of predicting aphasia severity. The optimal fractional-anisotropy cut-off values for the individual fibers of the Language-Related White Matter and their combinations were determined. Their correlations with Western Aphasia Battery subscores were analyzed. The arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi showed fair accuracy, the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus poor accuracy, and their combinations fair accuracy. Correlations between Language-Related White Matter parameters and Western Aphasia Battery subscores were found between the arcuate, superior longitudinal, and inferior frontal occipital fasciculi and spontaneous speech, auditory verbal comprehension, repetition, and naming. Diffusion-tensor-imaging-based language-Related White Matter analysis may help predict the severity of language impairment in patients with aphasia following stroke.","Lee, Jin-Kook; Ko, Myoung-Hwan; Park, Sung-Hee; Kim, Gi-Wook",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7997243/,614
18259,Effect of a Smartphone App on Weight Change and Metabolic Outcomes in Asian Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial,2021-06-03,"BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is considered to be the fourth 90 of UNAIDS 90-90-90 target to monitor the effects of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART has significantly increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, the impact of chronic infection on HRQoL remains unclear, while factors influencing the HRQoL may vary from one country to another. The current study aimed to assess HRQoL and its associated factors among PLWHA receiving ART in Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among PLWHA attending an ART centre of a tertiary care hospital in Islamabad, Pakistan. HRQoL was assessed using a validated Urdu version of EuroQol 5 dimensions 3 level (EQ-5D-3L) and its Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). RESULTS: Of the 602 patients included in the analyses, 59.5% (n = 358) reported no impairment in self-care, while 63.1% (n = 380) were extremely anxious/depressed. The overall mean EQ-5D utility score and visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) score were 0.388 (SD: 0.41) and 66.20 (SD: 17.22), respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the factors significantly associated with HRQoL were: female gender; age > 50 years; having primary and secondary education; > 1 year since HIV diagnosis; HIV serostatus AIDS-converted; higher CD 4 T lymphocytes count; detectable viral load; and increased time to ART. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings have shown that PLWHA in Pakistan adherent to ART had a good overall HRQoL, though with significantly higher depression. Some of the factors identified are amenable to institution-based interventions while mitigating depression to enhance the HRQoL of PLWHA in Pakistan. The HRQoL determined in this study could be useful for future economic evaluation studies for ART and in designing future interventions.","Ahmed, Ali; Saqlain, Muhammad; Bashir, Naila; Dujaili, Juman; Hashmi, Furqan; Mazhar, Faizan; Khan, Amjad; Jabeen, Musarat; Blebil, Ali; Awaisu, Ahmed",Qual Life Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8178128/,614
18553,An Upsurge of Hand Dermatitis Cases Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Since 2000, the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) modeling teams have developed and applied microsimulation and statistical models of breast cancer. Here, we illustrate the use of collaborative breast cancer multilevel systems modeling in CISNET to demonstrate the flexibility of systems modeling to address important clinical and policy-relevant questions. Challenges and opportunities of future systems modeling are also summarized. The 6 CISNET breast cancer models embody the key features of systems modeling by incorporating numerous data sources and reflecting tumor, person, and health system factors that change over time and interact to affect the burden of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary modeling teams have explored alternative representations of breast cancer to reveal insights into breast cancer natural history, including the role of overdiagnosis and race differences in tumor characteristics. The models have been used to compare strategies for improving the balance of benefits and harms of breast cancer screening based on personal risk factors, including age, breast density, polygenic risk, and history of Down syndrome or a history of childhood cancer. The models have also provided evidence to support the delivery of care by simulating outcomes following clinical decisions about breast cancer treatment and estimating the relative impact of screening and treatment on the United States population. The insights provided by the CISNET breast cancer multilevel modeling efforts have informed policy and clinical guidelines. The 20 years of CISNET modeling experience has highlighted opportunities and challenges to expanding the impact of systems modeling. Moving forward, CISNET research will continue to use systems modeling to address cancer control issues, including modeling structural inequities affecting racial disparities in the burden of breast cancer. Future work will also leverage the lessons from team science, expand resource sharing, and foster the careers of early stage modeling scientists to ensure the sustainability of these efforts.","Trentham-Dietz, Amy; Alagoz, Oguzhan; Chapman, Christina; Huang, Xuelin; Jayasekera, Jinani; van Ravesteyn, Nicolien T.; Lee, Sandra J.; Schechter, Clyde B.; Yeh, Jennifer M.; Plevritis, Sylvia K.; Mandelblatt, Jeanne S.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211268/,614
18584,The integrated screening action model (I-SAM): A theory-based approach to inform intervention development,2021-05-31,"BACKGROUND: The government is obliged to guarantee equal access to antenatal care (ANC) between urban and rural areas. This study aimed to analyze urban-rural disparities in ≥4 ANC visits during pregnancy in the Philippines and Indonesia. METHODS: The study processed data from the 2017 PDHS and the 2017 IDHS. The analysis unit was women aged 15–49 years old who had given birth in the last 5 years. The weighted sample size was 7992 respondents in the Philippines and 14,568 respondents in Indonesia. Apart from ANC as the dependent variable, other variables analyzed were residence, age, husband/partner, education, parity, and wealth. Determination of urban-rural disparities using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The results show that women in the urban Philippines are 0.932 times more likely than women in the rural Philippines to make ≥4 ANC visits. On the other side, women in urban Indonesia are more likely 1.255 times than women in rural Indonesia to make ≥4 ANC visits. Apart from the type of residence place (urban-rural), five other tested multivariate variables also proved significant contributions to ANC’s use in both countries, i.e., age, have a husband/partner, education, parity, and wealth status. CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that disparities exist between urban and rural areas utilizing ANC in the Philippines and Indonesia. Pregnant women in the rural Philippines have a better chance of making ≥4 ANC visits. Meanwhile, pregnant women in urban Indonesia have a better chance of making ≥4 ANC visits.","Wulandari, Ratna Dwi; Laksono, Agung Dwi; Rohmah, Nikmatur",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8229737/,614

19938,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic fracture characteristics in three hospitals in Turkey: A multi-center epidemiological study,2021-06-11,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the leading mammalian cell host employed to produce complex secreted recombinant biotherapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Metabolic selection marker technologies (e.g. glutamine synthetase (GS) or dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)) are routinely employed to generate such recombinant mammalian cell lines. Here we describe the development of a selection marker system based on the metabolic requirement of CHO cells to produce proline, and that uses pyrroline-5-carboxylase synthetase (P5CS) to complement this auxotrophy. Firstly, we showed the system can be used to generate cells that have growth kinetics in proline-free medium similar to those of the parent CHO cell line, CHOK1SV GS-KO™ grown in proline-containing medium. As we have previously described how engineering lipid metabolism can be harnessed to enhance recombinant protein productivity in CHO cells, we then used the P5CS selection system to re-engineer lipid metabolism by over-expression of either sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBF1) or stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). The cells with re-engineered proline and lipid metabolism showed consistent growth and P5CS, SCD1 and SREBF1 expression across 100 cell generations. Finally, we show that the P5CS and GS selection systems can be used together. A GS vector containing the light and heavy chains for a mAb was super-transfected into a CHOK1SV GS-KO™ host over-expressing SCD1 from a P5CS vector. The resulting stable transfectant pools achieved a higher concentration at harvest for a model difficult to express mAb than the CHOK1SV GS-KO™ host. This demonstrates that the P5CS and GS selection systems can be used concomitantly to enable CHO cell line genetic engineering and recombinant protein expression.","Budge, James D.; Roobol, Joanne; Singh, Gurdeep; Mozzanino, Théo; Knight, Tanya J.; Povey, Jane; Dean, Andrew; Turner, Sarah J.; Jaques, Colin M.; Young, Robert J.; Racher, Andrew J.; Smales, C.

25048,24 Infectieziekten,2011,"Approximately 12 million patients present with acute pharyngitis in the USA annually. Most episodes are viral; however, Group A streptococcus (GAS) is an important and treatable infection (Snow V, Mottur-Pilson C, Cooper RJ, et al., Ann Intern Med 2001;134:506). Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of acute pharyngitis and accounts for 15–30% of pharyngeal infections in children and 5–20% in adults. The goal of treatment is to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, as well as reduce complications and transmission. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for patients with a high index of suspicion for GAS pharyngitis or when it is confirmed by culture or rapid antigen detection testing (RADT).

25626,The Burden of Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases in Developing Countries,2010,"Strongyloides stercoralis, an intestinal nematode commonly known as the human threadworm, affects millions of people worldwide.(1) It is endemic in Southeast Asia, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the southeastern USA.(2) In the USA, the highest prevalence rates are found in eastern Kentucky and rural Tennessee. A unique feature of Strongyloides stercoralis infection is the occurrence of an autoinfection cycle which permits persistence of the parasite years after the normal host has left an endemic area. In this cycle, the rhabditiform larvae in the duodenojujenal portion of the small intestine transform directly into filariform (infective) larvae. The filariform larvae without leaving the body can reinfect the patient by penetrating the intestinal mucosa. This distinctive characteristic of Strongyloides, to persist and replicate within the host for decades, produces minimal or no symptoms. Immunocompromised patients may develop a fulminant illness due to a unique process in the life cycle of Strongyloides in which there are dramatic increases in the number of filariform larvae. In the hyperinfection syndrome, massive numbers of larvae migrate through the intestinal mucosa and into the lungs (the usual migration pattern) and disseminate to involve other organ systems not ordinarily a part of the life cycle of the parasite. Larvae may be found in the central nervous system, kidneys, liver, and almost any other organ.","Grossman, Marc E.; Fox, Lindy P.; Kovarik, Carrie; Rosenbach, Misha",Cutaneous Manifestations of Infection in the Immunocompromised Host,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122283/,614

43330,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Villages: Results of a National Survey,2020-12-16,"The medical use of oxygen has been widely and frequently proposed for patients, especially those under critical care; however, its benefit and drawbacks remain controversial for certain conditions. The induction of oxygen therapy is commonly considered for either treating or preventing hypoxia. Therefore, the concept of different types of hypoxia should be understood, particularly in terms of their mechanism, as the effect of oxygen therapy principally varies by the physiological characteristics of hypoxia. Oxygen molecules must be constantly delivered to all cells throughout the human body and utilized effectively in the process of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which is necessary for generating energy through the formation of adenosine triphosphate. If the oxygen availability at the cellular level is inadequate for sustaining the metabolism, the condition of hypoxia which is characterized as heterogeneity in tissue oxygen tension may develop, which is called dysoxia, a more physiological concept that is related to hypoxia. In such hypoxic patients, repetitive measurements of the lactate level in blood are generally recommended in order to select the adequate therapeutic strategy targeting a reduction in lactate production. Excessive oxygen, however, may actually induce a hyperoxic condition which thus can lead to harmful oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, possibly resulting in cellular dysfunction or death. In contrast, the human body has several oxygen-sensing mechanisms for preventing both hypoxia and hyperoxia that are employed to ensure a proper balance between the oxygen supply and demand and prevent organs and cells from suffering hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress. Thus, while the concept of hyperoxia is known to have possible adverse effects on the lung, the heart, the brain, or other organs in various pathological conditions of critically ill patients, and no obvious evidence has yet been proposed to totally support liberal oxygen supplementation in any subset of critically ill patients, relatively conservative oxygen therapy with cautious monitoring appears to be safe and may improve the outcome by preventing harmful oxidative stress resulting from excessive oxygen administration. Given the biological effects of oxygen molecules, although the optimal target levels remain controversial, unnecessary oxygen administration should be avoided, and exposure to hyperoxemia should be minimized in critically ill patients.","Nakane, Masaki",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734465/,614

Differences among the three countries in terms of the environment, economy, and energy mean that each is at a different stage of emission reduction. In this chapter, we take into account environmental, economic, and energy characteristics in China, Japan, and South Korea and assess their emission reduction strategies. While China is simultaneously grappling with poverty eradication, environmental protection, and responding to climate change, Japan and South Korea are combating climate change with leading technologies and high levels of energy efficiency.

51951,P13 Abdominal Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicentre Audit,2021-04-08,"This article conceptualizes the role of the social network within the concept of responsibility framing. Central elements of social network theory (different actors and their functions for the individual) and attribution theory are linked with research on media frames and framing. Specifically, we integrate the social network as a distinct influence level between the level of the individual and the societal level, which have been predominantly focused in existing research on the concept of responsibility framing. Social relationships are relevant across different communication contexts, e.g., activism or education, but their most important role might be in health communication. Health and health responsibility are significantly determined by an individual’s social relationships – both informal ones (e.g., family and friends) and formal ones (e.g., colleagues at work). Social relationships come with different functions including providing social support, shaping social norms, or influencing opinions or behaviors, and they thereofore strongly contribute to a person’s physical and mental constitution. Consequently, research in the health and social sciences acknowledges the social network as a distinct determinant for individual health. However, despite its significant impact, both news media reports about health issues and communication studies on health reporting largely disregard influences on the social network level. This is particularly evident within research on the concept of responsibility frames, i.e., frames emphasizing responsibility for causes of or solutions to a health issue. Many content analytical and experimental studies on responsibility framing focus on responsibility attributions at the individual vs. societal level. Therefore, only little is known about the prevalence and effects of responsibility frames on the level of an individuals social network. Few recent studies on the responsibility framing of chronic illness, however, indicate that responsibility attributions to the social network do appear in the media coverage, and that they seem to have an effect on the recipients’ responsibility attributions. From studies investigating the effects of responsibility frames at the individual vs. societal level, we know that individual frames lead to more individualized attributions and may inhibit the recipients’ policy endorsement and lower intentions of civic engagement. It is therefore likely that frames at the social network level significantly shape attributions, opinions and behavioral intentions of the audience. In addition, attribution theory suggests that certain characteristics of an issue, such as perceived controllability, influence intentions to help individuals affected by this issue. However, existing studies have not yet examined the extent to which the framing of responsibility attributions at the network level influences social support intentions. Overall, important factors influencing opinions and (health) behaviors, precisely factors at the social network level, have so far been largely neglected in framing research. Consequently, it is our objective to extend the concept of responsibility frames to include the level of social networks (in addition to the individual and societal level). With a three-level-model of the responsibility framing process, we demonstrate (1) how to include responsibility attributions at the network level in the framing process (frame building, frame setting) and (2), the consequences for research in communication studies. Frame building describes which factors influence the emergence of journalistic frames. Research suggests that if the social network plays an important role for a specific (health) behavior, strategic communication reflects this with social appeals or by addressing relevant pro-social behaviors. Moreover, a content analysis on the responsibility framing of diabetes mellitus and depression shows that social network influences are indeed prevalent in journalistic media coverage, albeit less than individual and social influences. As compared to media frames and framing effects, research on journalists’ frames and their attributions of responsibility is very rare. Therefore, an explorative approach to journalists’ responsibility frames seems appropriate. In the frame setting process, the media frames are studied as an independent variable. Thus, studies seek to answer the question whether and how media frames are reflected in the cognitive frames of the recipients—a question which is usually examined by experiments. To account for influences of the social network, both responsibility frames and the recipients’ responsibility attributions to the social network level should be considered in experimental studies. (3) We also discuss which topics are suitable for a transfer of this new theoretical conceptualization of responsibility framing. Since responsibility frames are defined as generic (i.e., independent of specific issues), we provide a theoretical foundation for framing research that can be applied to a variety of other topics. By outlining the results of individual studies of the DFG project “Representation and Effects of Responsibility Frames for Health Topics: A Comparison of the Relevance of the Individual, the Social Network, and the Society” (DFG project number RE-3650/4-1) we want to help make our model applicable to other research topics.","Reifegerste, Doreen; Wiedicke, Annemarie; Temmann, Linn Julia; Scherr, Sebastian",Publizistik,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8061455/,614

53086,"Impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) pandemic on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) hospitalizations, and related invasive procedures",2021-04-26,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Drug resistance is a serious problem in the treatment of HCC. Therefore, it is of high clinical impact to discover targeted therapies that may overcome drug-related resistance and improve the survival of patients affected by HCC. In the present study, we investigated the role of Isoform D of type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4D) in HCC development and progression. We found that PDE4D is over-expressed HCCs in vitro and in vivo and the depletion of the gene by silencing or the pharmacological inhibition of protein activity exerted anti-tumorigenic activities. ABSTRACT: Isoform D of type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4D) has recently been associated with several human cancer types with the exception of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we explored the role of PDE4D in HCC. We found that PDE4D gene/protein were over-expressed in different samples of human HCCs compared to normal livers. Accordingly, HCC cells showed higher PDE4D activity than non-tumorigenic cells, accompanied by over-expression of the PDE4D isoform. Silencing of PDE4D gene and pharmacological inhibition of protein activity by the specific inhibitor Gebr-7b reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in HCC cells, with a decreased fraction of cells in S phase and a differential modulation of key regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis. PDE4D silencing/inhibition also affected the gene expression of several cancer-related genes, such as the pro-oncogenic insulin growth factor (IGF2), which is down-regulated. Finally, gene expression data, available in the CancerLivER data base, confirm that PDE4D over-expression in human HCCs correlated with an increased expression of IGF2, suggesting a new possible molecular network that requires further investigations. In conclusion, intracellular depletion/inhibition of PDE4D prevents the growth of HCC cells, displaying anti-oncogenic effects. PDE4D may thus represent a new biomarker for diagnosis and a potential adjuvant target for HCC therapy.","Ragusa, Federica; Panera, Nadia; Cardarelli, Silvia; Scarsella, Marco; Bianchi, Marzia; Biagioni, Stefano; Giorgi, Mauro; Alisi, Anna; Massimi, Mara",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125776/,614

53214,533 The Use of Virtual Reality Simulation to Facilitate Surgical Ward-Based Learning in Medical Students During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background: Spontaneous resolution of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is extremely rare, and has previously been reported exclusively in the setting of apoplexy (auto-infarction) of a large parathyroid adenoma outgrowing its blood supply. We report an unusual case of spontaneous PHPT resolution after Covid-19 infection. Clinical Case: A 38-year-old Hispanic woman was seen in clinic for evaluation of hypercalcemia first noted on routine bloodwork in 2018. She had a history of nephrolithiasis (1 episode) but no other symptom associated with hypercalcemia. She was not on medications associated with hypercalcemia, and had no family history of Ca disorder. Serum biochemistry was notable for hypercalcemia (Ca: 10.9, 10.5, and 10.8 mg/dL, nl 8.4–10.2), normal albumin and Cr, elevated PTH (106 and 70 pg/mL, nl 15–65), with low phosphate (2.3 mg/dL, nl 2.4–4.5) and 25-OH-Vit. D (14 ng/mL, nl 20–80). 24-hr urinary studies showed elevated urine Ca (285 and 375 mg/day, nl 100–250), with urine Cr of 1.3 and 1.5 g/day, respectively. Findings of hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and elevated serum PTH, led to the diagnosis of PHPT. Neck ultrasound and sestamibi scan of the parathyroids with SPECT-CT did not localize any abnormal parathyroid gland. A month after PHPT diagnosis, and prior to surgical evaluation, patient presented with a 9-day history of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. She tested positive for Covid-19 infection by SARS-CoV-2 PCR on nasal swab, and was quarantined at home with symptomatic treatment. No glucocorticoids were given. Serum Ca was normal (9.5 mg/dL) at the time of Covid-19 diagnosis. All Covid-19 symptoms subsided 14 days after onset. Repeat labs 1 and 3 months after Covid-19 infection showed persistently normal serum Ca (10.0 and 9.8 mg/dL), with low then normal PTH (13 and 43 pg/mL), compatible with spontaneous resolution of PHPT. Patient denied any neck discomfort before, during, or after Covid-19 infection. Spontaneous resolution of PHPT is rare and follows apoplexy of a large parathyroid adenoma. In our patient, imaging failed to localize a large parathyroid adenoma, making it less likely that resolution of her PHPT was caused by apoplexy. Resolution of PHPT temporally coincided with Covid-19 infection, although the link between the two conditions is unclear at this time. Hypothesized mechanisms include an imbalance in the normal PTH-Ca axis caused by SARS-CoV-2 mediated release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interferon, previously reported to lower serum calcium), or development of antibodies against the parathyroid or CaSR. RNA and protein expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor gene, is not detected in normal parathyroid tissue. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of spontaneous resolution of PHPT after Covid-19 infection. Further studies are needed to understand the frequency of this occurrence, and the underlying mechanism.","Siddiqui, Mahwash F; Maalouf, Naim",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135266/,614
53293,197 Acute Management of Traumatic Anterior Shoulder Dislocations During COVID-19: Are We Meeting Published National Standards for Treatment During the Pandemic?,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Individuals on immunosuppressive therapies were among those identified by the UK Department of Health and Chief Medical Officer as clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. Advice on shielding from infection was disseminated by NHS England, primary care and NHS hospital trusts to those identified at highest risk. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) developed further risk stratification guidance specifically focused on autoimmune rheumatic disease. As the UK entered a period of nationwide lockdown on 23(rd) March 2020, the clinically highly vulnerable group were asked to shield from infection by staying at home and avoiding any face-to-face contact for an initial period of 12 weeks. The implications of social isolation, disruption to planned medical care and economic consequences became increasingly recognised. This work aimed to understand the experience and wellbeing of this patient group during week 5 -6 of UK Lockdown, as a guide to how we might best adapt services and address the needs of this group. Methods Short semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 141 patients during week five and six of UK lockdown, between 20th April and 1st May 2020. Participants were sampled systematically from the departmental biologic therapy database at Wexham Park Hospital, a general hospital providing services to a diverse population of approximately 450,000 people in Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire. Results Telephone interview was conducted with 141 patients prescribed biologic therapy. Written advice on risk and shielding was received by over 90%. Sixty four percent of respondents were female with a median age of 56 years. Thirty-nine percent of those interviewed fell within highest BSR risk category for whom full shielding was highly recommended, yet at the time of interview 51.1% of respondents reported they had committed to full shielding. Four percent of respondents self-identified as key workers and had continued their usual commitments. Amongst those interviewed, 35% reported significant adverse impact on their emotional and mental wellbeing within the first six weeks of UK lockdown. Isolation, uncertainty, limited physical exercise and cancellations to planned appointments were common themes. Twenty-eight percent of respondents felt their disease control had significantly deteriorated during the ongoing pandemic. Due to prevailing anxiety about the impact of immunosuppression on COVID-19 risk, 5% of patients had adjusted their prescribed therapies without the direct supervision or clinical advice. Conclusion This study gives initial insights into the behaviours and concerns of patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disease on biologic therapy during the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK. Wellbeing and disease management have considerably suffered for many individuals. Further understanding patient experience may help guide restructuring of rheumatology services in next phase of the UK pandemic. Disclosure L.M. Carter: None. H. Irvine: None. A.

METHOD: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all trauma referrals to the National Neurosurgical Centre at Beaumont Hospital, during the period March 1(st) – May 31(st), 2019 and 2020. Patient characteristics including age, sex, alcohol use, anticoagulant/antiplatelet use and initial Glasgow Coma Scale were recorded. Patients were grouped by trauma aetiology and diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 527 and 437 trauma referrals in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Overall, there was a 17.1% reduction in trauma referrals between years. Traumatic brain injury, spinal injury and cranial fractures referrals reduced 25% (375 vs 283), 59% (32 vs 13) and 18% (39 vs 32) respectively from 2019 to 2020. Low energy falls below 2 metres were the most common mechanism of injury and accounted for 60 and 61% of referrals in 2019 and 2020. No reduction in road traffic collision (33 vs 34) and assault (40 vs 40) referrals were observed between years. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the volume and mechanism of trauma referrals to the National Neurosurgical Centre in Ireland, with falls below 2 metres the most common mechanism of trauma referral across both years.","Horan, J; Duddy, J; Gilmartin, B; Nolan, D; Corr, P; Husien, M B; Bolger, C",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135651/,614

It makes responses challenging to compare intertemporally or interpersonally. This paper develops a formal model of the cognitive process that could give rise to scale norming in year on year responses to life satisfaction scale questions. It then uses this model to conceptually differentiate scale norming from adaptation and changes in reference points. Scale norming could make life satisfaction responses misleading with regards to the changing welfare of individuals. In particular, individuals who would say that their life is ""improving"" or ""going well"" might nonetheless give the same scale response year after year. This has negative implications for the use of scales in cost–benefit analysis and other welfarist applications. While there is already substantial empirical evidence for the existence of scale norming, its implications for welfare analysis are sometimes understated on the grounds that this evidence might simply be the product of errors of memory. The paper presents new empirical evidence for scale norming from two surveys (N1 = 278; N2 = 1050) designed such that errors of memory are an unconvincing explanation for the results.","Fabian, Mark",J Happiness Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506099/,614

Patient-reported outcomes after surgery include urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, decreased quality of life and psychological effects. Predictive tools to assess the likelihood of an individual experiencing various patient-reported outcomes have been developed to aid decision-making when selecting treatment. METHODS A systematic review was undertaken to identify all papers describing tools for the prediction of patient-reported outcome measures in men with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. To be eligible for inclusion, papers had to provide a summary measure of accuracy. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from July 2007. Title/abstract screening, and full-text review were undertaken by two reviewers, while data extraction and critical appraisal was performed by a single reviewer. RESULTS The search strategy identified 3217 potential studies, of which 191 progressed to full-text review and 14 were included. From these studies, 27 tools in total were identified, of which 18 predicted urinary symptoms, six predicted erectile function and one predicted freedom from a group of three outcomes ('trifecta') (biochemical recurrence, incontinence and erectile dysfunction). On the basis of tool accuracy (>70%) and external validation, two tools predicting incontinence and two tools predicting erectile dysfunction are ready for implementation. CONCLUSIONS A small number of tools for the prediction of patient-reported outcomes following radical prostatectomy have been developed.

60533,How can air quality affect health?,2020-11-01,"ABSTRACT In seeking to limit the number of new infections of COVID-19, governments around the world have implemented national lockdowns and guidelines about safe behaviours. Lockdown requires people to stay home and only leave when essential such as to purchase groceries and medication. In low- and middle-income countries, many of which have large proportions of the population living in precarity, lockdown forces millions of people to spend prolonged periods of time together in close proximity to one another and with limited resources. In many ways, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 in densely populated communities with limited access to food, water and sanitation may seem counter-intuitive and even impossible under conditions of precarity. In this paper, we explore the barriers to implementation of lockdown rules in conditions of precarity. We conceptualise the structural barriers by drawing on the Theoretical Domains Framework to explain how these barriers influence adherence to lockdown rules. We argue that without sufficient support or intervention to help poor communities mitigate these structural barriers, adhering to lockdown rules is difficult, resulting in continued COVID-19 infections.","Coetzee, Bronwyné Jo'sean; Kagee, Ashraf",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1779331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524893/,614
60677,Embracing the change: Resuming advanced trauma training in the COVID-19 era.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Consolidation treatment with an anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab, following concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (cCRT) has become a new standard of care for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The rationale of PD-L1 blockade after cCRT is based on preclinical evidence suggesting that chemotherapy and radiotherapy up-regulate tumoural PD-L1 expression, which has not been shown in clinical studies. METHODS To examine alteration in tumoural PD-L1 expression (tumour proportion score, TPS) and density of stromal CD8-positive tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8 + TILs) after cCRT, paired NSCLC samples obtained before and after cCRT were reviewed in comparison with those obtained before and after drug therapy. RESULTS PD-L1 expression was significantly up-regulated after cCRT (median TPS, 1.0 at baseline versus 48.0 after cCRT; P < 0.001), but not after drug therapy. There was no significant correlation between baseline TPS and post-cCRT TPS. CD8 + TIL density was significantly increased after cCRT (median, 10.6 versus 39.1; P < 0.001), and higher post-cCRT CD8 + TIL density was associated with a higher pathologic response and with a favourable survival (P = 0.019). CONCLUSION Tumoural PD-L1 expression was up-regulated after cCRT, which provides pathologic rationale for PD-L1 blockade following cCRT to improve prognosis. Stromal CD8 + TIL density was also increased after cCRT, and higher post-cCRT CD8 + TIL density was a favourable prognostic indicator.","Yoneda, Kazue; Kuwata, Taiji; Kanayama, Masatoshi; Mori, Masataka; Kawanami, Toshinori; Yatera, Kazuhiro; Ohguri, Takayuki; Hisaoka, Masanori; Nakayama, Toshiyuki; Tanaka, Fumihiro",British journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-019-0541-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388183/,614

Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to identify the types of interventions that have been used to optimise adherence to treatment for preventing or reducing skin scars in adults and children and to determine the effectiveness of these interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Databases (PubMed, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science and OTSeeker) will be searched using the developed search strategy to identify eligible randomised trials. Adults and children using scar treatments to prevent or manage scarring as a result of a dermal wound (which may occur following burn injury, surgery, lacerations, piercings, vaccinations, acne and other conditions affecting the skin) will be included. Any intervention with the potential to effect adherence will be included. Titles and abstracts located through searching will be screened by two independent reviewers. Full text of studies will also be screened to determine eligibility for final inclusion. Two reviewers will assess the quality of included studies using the Cochrane 'risk of bias' tool. Data extraction forms will be developed and two reviewers will extract the data. A third reviewer will be used at each stage to ensure consensus is achieved. Meta-analysis and meta-regression will be completed if appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis of results will be undertaken. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is necessary for this systematic review as no patients will be directly involved. Results of this systematic review will be disseminated through journal publications and relevant conference presentations.

61454,"COVID-19, rules of conduct for dental care in children during pandemic.",2020-08-03,"AIM Not only is the coronavirus pandemic about science and facts, it also raises a number of ethical questions. Some of the most important questions in this context are related to responsibility. First, what is a government's primary responsibility? Second, how should both the government and individuals consider personal moral responsibility in this context? METHOD This paper uses conceptual and normative analysis to address responsibility in the context of the pandemic. The paper also refers to reports published by the German Ethics Council, the Malaysian Bioethics Community and the Swedish National Council on Medical Ethics. RESULTS The primary responsibility of governments is to create a balance between individual values and rights, one hand, and the health of the population, on the other. There are good reasons to conceive of individual responsibility as a virtue, having to do with the development of crucial character traits and habits. The responsibility of governments is connected to individual responsibility through the values of trust and solidarity. CONCLUSIONS Governments need to communicate clearly (a) how they balance conflicts between collective health and individual rights and values and (b) what the chosen strategy entails in terms of collective and individual responsibility. Success requires attention to ethical values from all involved. Individuals will need to develop new character traits to help manage this pandemic and to prevent new ones. Governments must facilitate the development of such character traits by building trust and solidarity with and among citizens.","Nihlén Fahlquist, Jessica",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494821990250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550931/,614
61705,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on uveitis patients receiving immunomodulatory and biological therapies (COPE STUDY).,2020-10-03,"Visual extinction has been characterized by the failure to respond to a visual stimulus in the contralesional hemifield when presented simultaneously with an ipsilesional stimulus (Corbetta and Shulman, 2011). Unilateral damage to the macaque frontoparietal cortex commonly leads to deficits in contralesional target selection that resemble visual extinction. Recently, we showed that macaque monkeys with unilateral lesions in the caudal prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibited contralesional target selection deficits that recovered over 2-4 months (Adam et al., 2019). Here, we investigated the longitudinal changes in functional connectivity (FC) of the frontoparietal network after a small or large right caudal PFC lesion in four macaque monkeys. We collected ultra-high field resting-state fMRI at 7-T before the lesion and at weeks 1-16 post-lesion and compared the functional data with behavioural performance on a free-choice saccade task. We found that the pattern of frontoparietal network FC changes depended on lesion size, such that the recovery of contralesional extinction was associated with an initial increase in network FC that returned to baseline in the two small lesion monkeys, whereas FC continued to increase throughout recovery in the two monkeys with a larger lesion. We also found that the FC between contralesional dorsolateral PFC and ipsilesional parietal cortex correlated with behavioural recovery and that the contralesional dorsolateral PFC showed increasing degree centrality with the frontoparietal network. These findings suggest that both the contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres play an important role in the recovery of function. Importantly, optimal compensation after large PFC lesions may require greater recruitment of distant and intact areas of the frontoparietal network, whereas recovery from smaller lesions was supported by a normalization of the functional network.","Adam, Ramina; Johnston, Kevin; Menon, Ravi S; Everling, Stefan",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31707193/,614
61834,Clinical risk factors for mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-02-01,"Octopuses are active predators with highly flexible bodies and rich behavioral repertoires [1-3]. They display advanced cognitive abilities, and the size of their large nervous system rivals that of many mammals. However, only one third of the neurons constitute the CNS, while the rest are located in an elaborate PNS, including eight arms, each containing myriad sensory receptors of various modalities [2-4]. This led early workers to question the extent to which the CNS is privy to non-visual sensory input from the periphery and to suggest that it has limited capacity to finely control arm movement [3-5]. This conclusion seemed reasonable considering the size of the PNS and the results of early behavioral tests [3, 6-8]. We recently demonstrated that octopuses use visual information to control goal-directed complex single arm movements [9]. However, that study did not establish whether animals use information from the arm itself [9-12]. We here report on development of two-choice, single-arm mazes that test the ability of octopuses to perform operant learning tasks that mimic normal tactile exploration behavior and require the non-peripheral neural circuitry to use focal sensory information originating in single arms [1, 10]. We show that the CNS of the octopus uses peripheral information about arm motion as well as tactile input to accomplish learning tasks that entail directed control of movement. We conclude that although octopus arms have a great capacity to act independently, they are also subject to central control, allowing well-organized, purposeful behavior of the organism as a whole.","Gutnick, Tamar; Zullo, Letizia; Hochner, Binyamin; Kuba, Michael J",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916119/,614

Potential leakage risks, however, are associated with bilateral dog ear formation, which results from traditional double-stapling anastomosis. The authors determined the feasibility of combining these techniques with a commercial stapling set to achieve a nondog ear (end-to-end) anastomosis for patients with mid- and distal rectal neoplasms. Patients with early-stage (c/ycT1-2N0), mid- to distal rectal neoplasms and good anal sphincter function were included in this study. Laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed with a standard total mesorectal excision technique downward to the pelvic floor as low as possible. The bowel was resected proximal to the lesion with an endoscopic linear stapler. An anvil was inserted extracorporeally into the proximal colon via an extended working pore. The distal rectum coupled with the lesion was prolapsed and everted out of the anus. The neoplasm was resected with a sufficient margin above the dentate line under direct sight. A transrectal anastomosis without dog ears was performed intracorporeally to reconstitute the continuity of the bowel. Eleven cases, 6 male and 5 female patients, were included in this study. The mean operative time was 191 (129-292) minutes. The mean blood loss was 110 (30-300) mL. The median distal margin distance from the lower edge of the lesion to the dentate line was 1.5 (0.5-2.5) cm. All the resection margins were negative. Most patients experienced uneventful postoperative recoveries. No patient had anastomotic leak. Most patients had an acceptable stool frequency after loop ileostomy closure. Our preliminary data demonstrated the safety and feasibility of achieving a sound anastomosis without risking potential anastomotic leakage because of dog ear formation.","Zhuo, Changhua; Liang, Lei; Ying, Mingang; Li, Qingguo; Li, Dawei; Li, Yiwei; Peng, Junjie; Huang, Liyong; Cai, Sanjun; Li, Xinxiang",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000002285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26683958/,614
62814,Rapid Adoption of Telehealth at an Interprofessional Student-Run Free Clinic.,2020,"BACKGROUND This study examined the association between race/ethnicity and health insurance payer type with pediatric opioid and non-opioid ordering in an inpatient hospital setting. METHODS Cross-sectional inpatient encounter data from June 2013 to June 2018 was retrieved from a pediatric children's hospital in Southern California (N = 55,944), and statistical analyses were performed to determine associations with opioid ordering. RESULTS There was a significant main effect of race/ethnicity on opioid and non-opioid orders. Physicians ordered significantly fewer opioid medications, but a greater number of non-opioid medications, for non-Hispanic African American children than non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, and non-Hispanic White pediatric patients. There was also a main effect of health insurance payer type on non-opioid orders. Patients with government-sponsored plans (e.g., Medi-Cal, Medicare) received fewer non-opioid prescriptions compared with patients with both HMO and PPO coverage. Additionally, there was a significant race/ethnicity by insurance interaction on opioid orders. Non-Hispanic White patients with ""other"" insurance coverage received the greatest number of opioid orders. In non-Hispanic African American patients, children with PPO coverage received fewer opioids than those with government-sponsored and HMO insurance. For non-Hispanic Asian patients, children with PPO were prescribed more opioids than those with government-sponsored and HMO coverage. CONCLUSION Findings suggest that the relationship between race/ethnicity, insurance type, and physician decisions opioid prescribing is complex and multifaceted. Given that consistency in opioid prescribing should be seen regardless of patient background characteristics, future studies should continue to assess and monitor unequitable differences in care.","Ehwerhemuepha, Louis; Donaldson, Candice D; Kain, Zeev N; Luong, Vivian; Fortier, Michelle A; Feaster, William; Weiss, Michael; Tomaszewski, Daniel; Yang, Sun; Phan, Michael; Jenkins, Brooke N",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00882-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000430/,614

64247,Participating in telehealth is a complex occupation.,2020-05-22,"BACKGROUND Various minimally invasive therapies are important adjuncts to management of hepatic injuries. However, there is a certain subset of patients who will benefit from liver resection, but there are no reports in the literature on laparoscopic anatomical liver resection for the management of complications after blunt liver trauma. CASE PRESENTATION A 20-year-old male was admitted to the Emergency Unit of a tertiary referral center following a car accident. The patient was hemodynamically stable, and a radiologic workup demonstrated an isolated grade 3 injury of the left hemiliver. Initially, a nonoperative management was indicated, but during days following the injury, a high-volume biliary fistula complicated the clinical course. Despite percutaneous drainage, the development of devastating consequences of biliary peritonitis was imminent. A pure laparoscopic anatomical liver resection was performed. Left lateral sectionectomy eliminated the source of bile leak, and the surgery was completed with abdominal cavity lavage. Postoperative outcome was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 9 after injury and day 4 after surgery returning to his normal activity. CONCLUSIONS In highly selected, hemodynamically stable patients with no other life-threatening concomitant injuries, laparoscopic liver resection in elective setting is feasible and safe for the management of complications after complex blunt trauma of the left liver. Extensive experience with hepatic surgery is needed, and surgeons should understand the increased risk they assume by taking on more complex surgical techniques.","Ivanecz, Arpad; Pivec, Vid; Ilijevec, Bojan; Rudolf, Saša; Potrč, Stojan",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-018-0432-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572673/,614

Since April 2010, 23 patients have undergone single-port laparoscopic surgery for simple nephrectomy (n = 11 patients) and radical nephrectomy (n = 12) by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The mean operative time was 265.2 min and the mean estimated blood loss was 96.7 mL. The procedure was completed in all patients without conversion to standard laparoscopy or open surgery. No intraoperative or acute postoperative complications occurred. When the single-port retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy group was retrospectively compared with the group that had undergone standard retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy, no significant difference was noted with respect to age, body mass index, operation time, time to eat, catheter removal or length of hospitalization (P > 0.05). A significant difference in favor of the single-port retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy group was noted with respect to the estimated blood loss (P = 0.027) and the visual analog pain scale score at discharge (P = 0.016).

66214,Pollen counts and suicide rates. Association not replicated.,2012,"BACKGROUND The use of synthetic mesh to repair a potentially contaminated incisional hernia may lead to higher failure rates. A biological mesh might be considered, but little is known about long-term results. Both biological and synthetic meshes were investigated in an experimental model of peritonitis to assess their characteristics in vivo. METHODS Male Wistar rats were randomized into five groups and peritonitis was induced. A mesh was implanted after 24 h. Five meshes were investigated: Permacol™ (cross-linked collagen), Strattice™ (non-cross-linked collagen), XCM Biologic® (non-cross-linked collagen), Omyra® Mesh (condensed polytetrafluoroethylene) and Parietene™ (polypropylene). The rats were killed after either 30, 90 or 180 days. Incorporation and shrinkage of the mesh, adhesion coverage, strength of adhesions and histology were analysed. RESULTS Of 135 rats randomized, 18 died from peritonitis. Some 180 days after implantation, both XCM Biologic® and Permacol™ had significantly better incorporation than Strattice™ (P = 0·003 and P = 0·009 respectively). Strattice™ had significantly fewer adhesions than XCM Biologic® (P = 0·001) and Permacol™ (P = 0·020). Thirty days after implantation, Permacol™ had significantly stronger adhesions than Strattice™ (P < 0·001). Shrinkage was most prominent in XCM Biologic® , but no significant difference was found compared with the other meshes. Histological analysis revealed marked differences in foreign body response among all meshes. CONCLUSION This experimental study suggested that XCM Biologic® was superior in terms of incorporation, macroscopic mesh infection, and histological parameters such as collagen deposition and neovascularization. There must be sufficient overlap of mesh during placement, as XCM Biologic® showed a high rate of shrinkage. Surgical relevance The use of synthetic mesh to repair a potentially contaminated incisional hernia is not supported unequivocally, and may lead to a higher failure rate. A biological mesh might be considered as an alternative. There are few long-term studies, as these meshes are expensive and rarely used. This study evaluated the use of biological mesh in a contaminated environment, and investigated whether there is an ideal mesh. A new non-cross-linked biological mesh (XCM Biologic® ) was evaluated in this experiment. The new non-cross-linked biological mesh XCM Biologic® performed best and may be useful in patients with a potentially contaminated incisional hernia.","Kaufmann, R; Jairam, A P; Mulder, I M; Wu, Z; Verhelst, J; Vennix, S; Giesen, L J X; Clahsen-van Groningen, M C; Jeekel, J; Lange, J F",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28901533/,614

Many reconstructive modalities are available, each with varying utility and efficacy. The goal of this study was to provide an algorithmic approach to nasal reconstruction and illustrate lessons learned from decades of reconstructing Mohs defects. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive patients who underwent nasal reconstruction after Mohs excision from 2003 to 2019 performed by the senior author (J.F.T.). Data were collected and analyzed regarding patient and clinical demographics, defect characteristics, reconstructive modality used, revisions, and complications. RESULTS A total of 2553 cases were identified, among which 1550 (1375 patients) were analyzed. Defects most commonly affected the nasal ala (48.1 percent); 74.8 percent were skin-only. Full-thickness skin-grafts were the most common reconstructive method (36.2 percent); 24.4 percent of patients underwent forehead flaps and 17.0 percent underwent nasolabial flaps. The overall complication rate was 11.6 percent (n = 181), with poor wound healing being most common. Age older than 75 years, defects larger than 2 cm2, and active smoking were associated with increased complication rates. CONCLUSIONS Nasal reconstruction can be divided based on anatomical location, and an algorithmic approach facilitates excellent results. Although local flaps may be suitable for some patients, they are not always the most aesthetic option. The versatility and low risk-to-benefit profile of the forehead flap make it a suitable option for elderly patients. Although reconstruction is still safe to be performed without discontinuation of anticoagulation, older age, smoking, and large defect size are predictors of complications.

67124,Common Difficult Scenarios for The Newly Qualified Dental Professional.,2021-06-01,"Feature-based attention is the ability to selectively attend to a particular feature (e.g., attend to red but not green items while looking for the ketchup bottle in your refrigerator), and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) measured from the human EEG signal have been used to track the neural deployment of feature-based attention. Although many published studies suggest that we can use trial-by-trial cues to enhance relevant feature information (i.e., greater SSVEP response to the cued color), there is ongoing debate about whether participants may likewise use trial-by-trial cues to voluntarily ignore a particular feature. Here, we report the results of a preregistered study in which participants either were cued to attend or to ignore a color. Counter to prior work, we found no attention-related modulation of the SSVEP response in either cue condition. However, positive control analyses revealed that participants paid some degree of attention to the cued color (i.e., we observed a greater P300 component to targets in the attended vs. the unattended color). In light of these unexpected null results, we conducted a focused review of methodological considerations for studies of feature-based attention using SSVEPs. In the review, we quantify potentially important stimulus parameters that have been used in the past (e.g., stimulation frequency, trial counts) and we discuss the potential importance of these and other task factors (e.g., feature-based priming) for SSVEP studies.","Adam, Kirsten C S; Chang, Lillian; Rangan, Nicole; Serences, John T",Journal of cognitive neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33416444/,614

We evaluated the effect of cryopreservation of grafts on allogeneic transplant outcomes using related, unrelated and haploidentical donors, including 958 patients, age 18-74 years (median 55) and using PBSC for various hematologic malignancies. Fresh grafts were received by 648 (68%) patients, 310 (32%) received cryopreserved. There was no difference between fresh versus cryopreserved grafts for neutrophil engraftment (p=0.09), platelet engraftment (p=0.11), graft failure (5.6% versus 6.8%, p=0.46) and grade II-IV acute GVHD (p=0.71), moderate/severe chronic GVHD was observed in 176 (27%) versus 123 (40%) patients, respectively (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated no difference between fresh versus cryopreserved for OS (p=0.39) and CIR (p=0.08) while fresh grafts demonstrated borderline increased NRM (HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.02-1.59, p=0.04). Of note, for patients with no or mild chronic GVHD, CIR was less for fresh compared to cryopreserved (HR=0.67 for fresh, 95% CI 0.48-0.92, p=0.01).

In this approach, ASCs are enriched through magnetic capture, and secreted antibodies are magnetically detected by a miniaturized nuclear magnetic resonance (μNMR) system. This approach is based entirely on magnetics, which supports high contrast against biological background and simplifies assay procedures. We advanced the MCD system by (i) synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles with high magnetic moments for both cell capture and antibody detection, (ii) developing a miniaturized magnetic device for high-yield cell capture, and (iii) optimizing the μNMR assay for antibody detection. Antibody responses targeting hemolysin E (HlyE) can accurately identify individuals with acute enteric fever. As a proof-of-concept, we applied MCD to detect antibodies produced by HlyE-specific hybridoma cells. The MCD achieved high sensitivity in detecting antibodies secreted from as few as 5 hybridoma cells (50 cells/mL). Importantly, the assay could be performed with whole blood with minimal sample processing.","Park, Ki Soo; Kim, Hoyoung; Kim, Soojin; Lee, Kyungheon; Park, Sohyeon; Song, Jun; Min, Changwook; Khanam, Farhana; Rashu, Rasheduzzaman; Bhuiyan, Taufiqur Rahman; Ryan, Edward T; Qadri, Firdausi; Weissleder, Ralph; Cheon, Jinwoo; Charles, Richelle C; Lee, Hakho",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.7b06074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121461/,614

However, some children required hospital and/or PICU admission. The aim of this short communication is to share our experience with Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) when managing these patients. Remarkably, all cases presented pleural and pericardial effusions, detected by POCUS, despite showing an adequate urinary output and prior to receiving any kind of fluid resuscitation. Effusions have been described as rare among SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult population. By performing portable chest X-Ray they would have gone unnoticed in our patients. Other POCUS findings consisted of all types of consolidations and coalescent B-line patterns. POCUS was also performed in order to optimize PEEP, checking adequate endotracheal intubation positioning (avoiding the risk of contagiousness related to auscultation in this framework), and to assess volemia status, cardiac performance, and brain neuro-monitoring. There was not cross-infection. In pediatric SARS-CoV-19 effusions are frequent but easily unnoticed unless lung and echo POCUS are performed.","Vazquez Martínez, J L; Pérez-Caballero Macarrón, C; Coca Pérez, A; Tapia Moreno, R; Otheo de Tejada, E",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_22284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32744707/,614
68909,Responsible data sharing in international health research: a systematic review of principles and norms.,2019,"Epidemiologic studies have provided evidence that prenatal exposure to maternal infection is associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia in the offspring. Research over the past decade has added further to our understanding of the role of prenatal infection in schizophrenia risk. These investigations include several well-powered designs, and like some earlier studies, measured maternal antibodies to specific infectious agents in stored serum samples and large registers to identify clinically diagnosed infections during pregnancy. Convergent findings from antibody studies suggest that prenatal maternal infection with Toxoplasma gondii is associated with increased schizophrenia risk in the offspring, while associations with HSV-2 infection are likely attributable to confounding. Maternal influenza infection remains a viable candidate for schizophrenia, based on an early serological study, though there has been only one attempt to replicate this finding, with a differing methodology. A prior association between maternal serologically confirmed cytomegalovirus infections require further study. Clinically diagnosed maternal infection, particularly bacterial infection, also appears to be associated with increased risk of offspring schizophrenia, and heterogeneity in these findings is likely due to methodological differences between studies. Further clarification may be provided by future studies that address the timing, type, and clinical features of infections. Important insight may be gained by examining the long-term offspring outcomes in emerging epidemics such as Zika virus and COVID-19, and by investigating the interaction between exposure to prenatal infection and other risk or protective factors.","Cheslack-Postava, Keely; Brown, Alan S",Schizophrenia research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2021.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016508/,614

DESIGN A randomized, controlled clinical trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). SETTING Private gynecologic clinic in Medellin, Colombia. PATIENTS One hundred fifty women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign pathology. INTERVENTIONS The patients underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy with intracorporeal closure of the vaginal cuff and were randomized to 2 groups, 1 using a barbed suture (V-Loc 90; Medtronic/Covidien, New Haven, CT) and 1 using polyglactin 910 (coated Vicryl suture; Ethicon/Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The total operative time, closing time of the vaginal vault, presence of complications in the cuff, and incidence of postoperative dyspareunia were recorded. The patients were evaluated at a postoperative office visit 2 weeks after the procedure and by telephone interview at 24 weeks. Seventy-five patients were included in the barbed suture group and 75 patients in the polyglactin 910 group. The average time to complete the suture of the vaginal cuff was 12.01 minutes (± 5.37 standard deviation) for the barbed suture group versus 13.49 minutes (± 6.48) in the polyglactin 910 group (95% confidence interval, -.44 to 3.4; p = .130). Blood loss was 31.56 ± 22.93 mL in the barbed suture group versus 30.82 ± 21.75 mL in the polyglactin 910 group (95% confidence interval, -7.95 to 6.47; p = .840). The frequency of postoperative events such as hematoma, cellulitis, cuff dehiscence, fever, emergency consultation, and hospitalization was not statistically significant between groups. No statistically significant difference was found regarding deep dyspareunia at 24 postoperative weeks. CONCLUSION No differences were found in surgical time or frequency of adverse events when comparing patients after vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture versus polyglactin 910.","López, Claudia C; Ríos, José F De Los; González, Yenyffer; Vásquez-Trespalacios, Elsa María; Serna, Daniel; Arango, Adriana; Cifuentes, Carolina; Vásquez, Ricardo; Castañeda, Juan D; Almanza, Luis A; Jiménez, Luis A",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2018.08.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30414998/,614

Schwartz et al., Virology 366:166-173, 2007). Here we have generated and characterized VSV-based vaccines that express the A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (clade 0) H5 HA from the first position of the VSV genome. These vectors induce broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses of different clades in mice. The vaccines provide complete protection against morbidity and mortality after heterologous challenge with clade 0 and clade 1 strains in animals even 1 year after vaccination. Postchallenge pulmonary virus loads show that these vectors provide sterilizing immunity. Therefore, VSV-based AIV vaccines are potent, broadly cross-protective pandemic vaccine candidates.","Schwartz, Jennifer A; Buonocore, Linda; Suguitan, Amorsolo L; Silaghi, Alex; Kobasa, Darwyn; Kobinger, Gary; Feldmann, Heinz; Subbarao, Kanta; Rose, John K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02637-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20181720/,614

The possible spatial clustering of positive herds compared with negative herds was also investigated. For each herd, a pooled milk sample from five primiparous cows was analysed for the presence of antibodies to BCV and BRSV. Herd-level information was obtained by a questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between predictors and antibody status to BCV and BRSV. Large herd size, being located in southern Sweden, and not providing boots for visitors were found to be associated with being antibody-positive to BCV and BRSV. A short distance to the nearest cattle herd was an additional risk factor for BCV. One of the studied areas was suitable for spatial analysis. Positive herds were not spatially autocorrelated when compared with negative herds as estimated by the K-function regarding both BCV and BRSV. This indicates that local factors such as daily visiting milk trucks and wild animals were unlikely to be important sources of infection in this area. Moran's I statistics and semi-variogram showed no evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, indicating that remaining unidentified factors are not spatially dependent in the areas under study.","Ohlson, A; Heuer, C; Lockhart, C; Tråvén, M; Emanuelson, U; Alenius, S",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.c4119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20693503/,614

Whether LCBDE-PC is feasible and beneficial for patients with PUAS remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of LCBDE-PC for patients with PUAS. METHODS From June 2011 to September 2019, 1167 patients who underwent laparoscopic procedures for choledocholithiasis were reviewed retrospectively. Perioperative outcomes were compared between patients with and without PUAS in un-matched and matched cohorts. RESULTS LCBDE-PC was performed successfully in 88.3% of patients with PUAS, and 92.5% of patients without PUAS (P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that PUAS was not a risk factor that affected successful performance of LCBDE-PC. Although a higher rate of conversion to open surgery and longer operative time were observed in patients with PUAS, no significant differences were found between patients with and without PUAS in multivariate and propensity score analysis (P > 0.05). A predictive nomogram for LCBDE-PC failure was developed based on potential predictors from the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model. Successful performance of LCBDE-PC was associated with operative time. A linear regression model for operative time showed impacted stone in the CBD and intraoperative laser use was the most important factor in determining the operative time. CONCLUSION LCBDE-PC is feasible and beneficial for patients with PUAS. However, patients with PUAS with a high possibility of LCBDE-PC failure from the nomogram and a longer operative time from the linear regression model should be cautious when undergoing LCBDE-PC.","Xu, Bin; Luo, Tingyi; Yang, Tingsong; Wang, Shilin; Meng, Hongbo; Gong, Jian; Zhou, Bo; Zheng, Wenyan; Song, Zhenshun",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08371-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650005/,614

The aim of this study was to investigate how social restriction may have contributed to weight changes in adolescents with obesity. Secondary aim was to evaluate possible parameters influencing weight changes. METHODS AND RESULTS Parameters of 51 obese adolescents were compared between two visits: within 2 months before 8 March, start of lockdown, and within 40 days after the end of it. RESULTS Mean weight gain during lockdown was 2.8 ± 3.7 kg (p < 0.001). Weight increase was higher in males than in females (3.8 ± 3.4 kg vs 1.2 ± 3.7 kg, p = 0.02). The hours dedicated to SB increased (+2.9 ± 2.8 h/day; p < 0.001) while the hours of PA decreased (-1.0 ± 1.6 h/week; p < 0.001). Males spent more hours in SB than females (+3.8 ± 2.7 h/day vs +1.5 ± 2.5 h/day; p = 0.003). There were minor changes in diet during lockdown. The most significant variables influencing both delta BMI and waist/height ratio increase were hours devoted to SB during lockdown and differences in mild and moderate PA before and after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS Obese adolescents showed a worsening of obesity during lockdown, with males mainly affected, mainly due to a reduced mild PA and increased hours spent in SB.","Maltoni, Giulio; Zioutas, Maximiliano; Deiana, Giuseppina; Biserni, Giovanni Battista; Pession, Andrea; Zucchini, Stefano","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.03.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994065/,614

Individual genetic, biological or hemodynamic factors are inadequate to explain the heterogeneity of ATAA development/progression mechanisms, thus stimulating the analysis of their complex interplay. Here the disruption of the hemodynamic environment in the ATAA is investigated integrating patient-specific computational hemodynamics, CT-based in vivo estimation of local aortic stiffness and advanced fluid mechanics methods of analysis. The final aims are (1) deciphering the ATAA spatiotemporal hemodynamic complexity and its link to near-wall topological features, and (2) identifying the existing links between arterial wall degeneration and hemodynamic insult. Technically, two methodologies are applied to computational hemodynamics data, the wall shear stress (WSS) topological skeleton analysis, and the Complex Networks theory. The same analysis was extended to the healthy aorta. As main findings of the study, we report that: (1) different spatiotemporal heterogeneity characterizes the ATAA and healthy hemodynamics, that markedly reflect on their WSS topological skeleton features; (2) a link (stronger than canonical WSS-based descriptors) emerges between the variation of contraction/expansion action exerted by WSS on the endothelium along the cardiac cycle, and ATAA wall stiffness. The findings of the study suggest the use of advanced methods for a deeper understanding of the hemodynamics disruption in ATAA, and candidate WSS topological skeleton features as promising indicators of local wall degeneration.","De Nisco, Giuseppe; Tasso, Paola; Calò, Karol; Mazzi, Valentina; Gallo, Diego; Condemi, Francesca; Farzaneh, Solmaz; Avril, Stéphane; Morbiducci, Umberto",Medical engineering & physics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709262/,614

In this study, our objectives were to determine if infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) upregulates expression of the B cell differentiation factors A proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) and B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), if this is a common feature of viral airway infection, and how this is regulated in human airway epithelial cells. METHODS We measured BAFF and APRIL protein expression in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from infants with severe RSV disease, and healthy control children, and in nasopharyngeal aspirates from preschool children with other single respiratory viral infections. We also measured mRNA expression in bronchial brushings from RSV-infected infants, and in RSV-infected paediatric primary airway epithelial cell cultures (pAEC). Beas-2B cell cultures were used to examine mechanisms regulating BAFF expression. RESULTS BAFF protein and mRNA were elevated (in marked contrast with APRIL) in BAL and bronchial brushings, respectively, from RSV-infected infants. BAFF protein was also found in upper airway secretions from children with human metapneumovirus, H1N1, bocavirus, rhinovirus, RSV and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. BAFF mRNA and protein were expressed following in vitro RSV infection of both pAEC and Beas-2B cultures, with mRNA expression peaking 12-h postinfection. BAFF induction was blocked by addition of a neutralising anti-interferon-β antibody or palivizumab. CONCLUSIONS BAFF, produced through an interferon-β-dependent process, is a consistent feature of airway infection, and suggests a role for the airway epithelia in supporting protective antibody and B cell responses in the lung.","McNamara, P S; Fonceca, A M; Howarth, D; Correia, J B; Slupsky, J R; Trinick, R E; Al Turaiki, W; Smyth, R L; Flanagan, B F",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2012-202288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23002173/,614

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of three hemostatic agents: BleedArrest, TraumaDex, and Celox. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective, experimental study using male Yorkshire swine. The pigs (n = 5 per group) were randomly assigned to one of the following: BleedArrest, TraumaDex, Celox, or control. To simulate a trauma injury, the investigators generated a complex groin injury with transection of the femoral artery and vein in all pigs. After 1 min of uncontrolled hemorrhage, one of the hemostatic agents was poured into the wound, followed by standard wound packing. The control group underwent the same procedures with the exception of the hemostatic agents. In all groups, 5 min of direct manual pressure was applied to the wound followed by a standard pressure dressing. After 30 min, dressings were removed, and the amount of bleeding was determined. RESULTS There were significant differences between the BleedArrest (mean = 21.2, SD ± 36.6 mL) TraumaDex (mean = 68, SD ± 103.5 mL) and Celox (mean = 18.l6, SD ± 41.6 mL) groups compared with Control group (mean = 230, SD ± 154 mL) (P < 0.05).

We aimed to assess whether the additional administration of aspirin during endovascular intervention increases bleeding rates. METHODS We retrospectively compared bleeding complications and outcome in stroke patients who received bridging thrombolysis with (tPA+ASA) and without (tPA-ASA) aspirin during endovascular intervention between November 2008 and March 2014. Furthermore, we analyzed bleeding complications and outcome in antiplatelet naïve patients with those with prior or acute antiplatelet therapy. RESULTS Baseline characteristics, previous medication, and dosage of rtPA did not differ between 50 tPA+ASA (39 aspirin naïve, 11 preloaded) and 181 tPA-ASA patients (p>0.05). tPA+ASA patients had more often internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion (p<0.001), large artery disease (p<0.001) and received more often acute stenting of the ICA (p<0.001). 10/180 (5.6%) tPA-ASA patients and 3/49 (6.1%) tPA+ASA patients suffered a sICH (p = 1.0). Rates of asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic bleeding complications and outcome did not differ between both groups (p>0.1). There were no differences in bleeding complications and mortality among 112 bridging patients with antiplatelet therapy (62 preloaded, 39 acute administration, 11 both) and 117 antiplatelet naïve patients. In a logistic regression analysis, aspirin administration during endovascular procedure was not a predictor of sICH.

75251,"Supporting ""Bleeders"" and ""Billers"": How Safety-Net Administrators Mitigate Provider Burnout During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond.",2021,"BACKGROUND Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is an emerging technique in the field of thoracic surgery. In this article, we aimed to describe uniportal VATS lobectomy that was conventionally performed in an Eastern center, which might help facilitate a good beginning in practice this technique. METHODS The indications of uniportal VATS lobectomy are merely equal, if not the same, to multiportal VATS lobectomy. All patients would receive a combination of epidural and general anesthesia, and were provided with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperatively. Generally, the patient was kept in a folding knife gesture (with the cranial side slightly raised up and caudal side pushed down) in lateral decubitus position. RESULTS In uniportal VATS lobectomy, the geographical view differed from multiportal VATS, while the thoracic cavity required carefully exploration to identify any unexpected invasion or metastasis. Since the incision was located at the anterior axillary line close to the anterior part of the hilar, the posterior part of the hilar, and diaphragm were far from the surgical incision. CONCLUSIONS Uniportal VATS, is not the happy ending in thoracic surgery. Beside its rapid progression, there remained a lot of questions to answer. Its uncovered benefits and drawbacks over traditional VATS, its possible improvements, and less invasive peri-operative managements could be the future topics. A comparison between uniportal versus multiportal VATS using high-level methodology is therefore required. With the development of surgical minds and instruments, uniportal VATS would have done more to the patients.","Shen, Yaxing; Liu, Yi; Feng, Mingxiang; Wang, Hao; Tan, Lijie; Xi, Yong; Wang, Qun",Journal of visualized surgery,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2221-2965.2015.05.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29075595/,614

Its origins and distinction derive from over-population with inequity and an industrial revolution since the 17th century which has exploited fossil fuels as a globalised energy source, a period now described as the anthropocene. Asymptotic ecosystem loss and dysfunction, for people whose being is socioecological, makes ultimate survival tenuous. Microbial forms of life jump species when habitats are destroyed, or their host misused. Our innate immunity depends on our general health and fitness- social, mental, physical, and nutritional, in step with nature and its rhythms through walking in it, enjoying sunlight and sleep. Biodiversity and the associated benefit of food variety, after being breast-fed, is the key descriptor of a healthful, sustainable, accessible, and acceptable way of eating. How this pattern might contribute to our resilience in the face of a highly transmissible and biologically evasive virus is becoming clear.

75958,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice in India: Results of an Anonymized National Survey.,2020,"BACKGROUND Current methods for describing physical work demands often lack detail and format standardization, require technical training and expertise, and are time-consuming to complete. A video-based physical demands description (PDD) tool may improve time and accuracy concerns associated with current methods. METHODS Ten simulated occupational tasks were synchronously recorded using a motion capture system and digital video. The tasks included a variety of industrial tasks from lifting to drilling to overhead upper extremity tasks of different cycle times. The digital video was processed with a novel video-based assessment tool to produce 3D joint trajectories (PDAi), and joint angle and reach envelope measures were calculated and compared between both data sources. RESULTS Root mean squared error between video-based and motion capture posture estimated ranged from 89.0 mm to 118.6 mm for hand height and reach distance measures, and from 13.5° to 21.6° for trunk, shoulder, and elbow angle metrics. Continuous data were reduced to time-weighted bins, and video-based posture estimates showed 75% overall agreement and quadratic-weight Cohen's kappa scores ranging from 0.29 to 1.0 compared to motion capture data across all posture metrics. CONCLUSION AND APPLICATION The substantial level of agreement between time-weighted bins for video-based and motion capture measures suggest that video-based job task assessment may be a viable approach to improve accuracy and standardization of field physical demands descriptions and minimize error in joint posture and reach envelope estimates compared to traditional pen-and-paper methods.","McKinnon, Colin D; Sonne, Michael W; Keir, Peter J",Human factors,https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720820951349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912047/,614

Relative quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA transcription level of selected egg-laying regulatory genes in the ovary tissues of ducks at different laying stages. Study shows: during the laying period of Pekin duck, ESR1, LRP1, IGF-1 and LHR were involved in the regulation of egg-laying, and the high expression of LRP1 in the late stage could inhibit egg production. Still, the expression products of the other three genes showed promoting effect. During the laying period of Black Muscovy duck, FSH, VLDLR, IGF-1, PRLR, LHR and LRP1 participated in the regulation of egg-laying, in which the expression products of the first five genes could promote egg production, while LRP1 showed inhibitory effect. Through our experiments, these data will provide strong theoretical support for the breeding of Pekin duck and Black Muscovy duck.","Liu, Guangyu; Zeng, Mingfei; Li, Xingxing; Rong, Yu; Hu, Zhigang; Zhang, Huilin; Liu, Xiaolin",Gene,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.145183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007371/,614

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our sequential experience of treating 124 large subcapsular hepatic hemangiomas in 121 patients with laparoscopic RF ablation. RESULTS The mean diameter of the 124 hemangiomas was 9.1 ± 3.2 cm (5.0-16.0 cm). RF ablation was performed successfully in all patients. There were 55 complications related to the ablation in 26 patients, including 5 of 69 (7.3%) patients with hemangioma <10 cm and 21 of 52 (40.4%) patients with hemangiomas ≥10 cm (P < 0.001). No injuries to abdominal viscera occurred in all the 121 patients. According to the Dindo-Clavien classification, all the complications were minor in 26 patients (Grade I). Out of 124 hepatic hemangiomas, 118 (95.2%) were completely ablated, including 70 of 72 (97.2%) lesions < 10 cm and 48 of 52 (92.3%) lesions ≥ 10 cm (P = 0.236). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic RF ablation therapy is a safe, feasible and effective procedure for large subcapsular hepatic hemangiomas, even in the hepatic hemangiomas ≥ 10 cm. Its use avoids thermal injury to the abdominal viscera.","Gao, Jun; Ji, Jian-Song; Ding, Xue-Mei; Ke, Shan; Xin, Zong-Hai; Ning, Chun-Min; Guo, Shi-Gang; Li, Xiao-Long; Dong, Yong-Hong; Sun, Wen-Bing",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26901132/,614

Healthcare professionals are exposed to a particularly high risk of contracting the virus while providing resuscitation and respiratory support, which may in turn result in grave consequences and even death. Although COVID-19 has been shown to cause milder disease in children, paediatricians and intensivists who provide care for children must be prepared to provide optimal respiratory support without putting themselves or other medical, nursing, and paramedical staff at undue risk. We propose an airway management approach that is especially relevant in the current COVID-19 pandemic and provides instructions for: (1) Elective intubation for respiratory failure; and (2) Emergency intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To minimise risk, intubation methods must be kept as straightforward as possible and should include the provision of appropriate personal protection and equipment to healthcare workers. We identify two key considerations: that bag-mask ventilation should be avoided if possible and that bacterial and viral filters should be placed in the respiratory circuit. Our novel approach provides a framework for airway management that could benefit paediatric critical care practitioners who provide care for any children with a novel viral illness, with a focus on infection prevention during high-risk airway management procedures.","Leung, K K Y; Ku, S W; Fung, R C M; Hui, W F; Au, C C; Cheung, W L; Szeto, W H; Wong, J C P; Kwan, K F; Hon, K L",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750741/,614

Flavor-representing the integration of olfaction (smell) with gustation (physiologic taste) and as influenced by oral somatosenses-is rarely afforded attention in oral research and dental practice. This article considers the interrelationship between oral health and flavor and highlights gaps in current knowledge. Altered oral function associated with operative and restorative treatment can feasibly alter the perception of flavor through diverse ways. Oral diseases and the generation of biofilms on restorative materials have potential to influence the oral microbiota and the perception of flavor. Alterations in masticatory function (through tooth loss, restorative materials, and prostheses with nonbiological surfaces and shapes) compounded by associated influences in the composition and quantity of saliva can affect the release of odorants and tastants from foods and beverages. Furthermore, changes occur in the perception of flavor throughout life and are significant in the aging and medically compromised population with the potential to affect nutrition and pleasure. Dental research and clinical practice should be at the forefront of biomedical science in understanding and promoting the importance and relevance of flavor in the well-being of patients. However, more research is required to guide clinical practice in consideration of olfactory and gustatory function as a component of total patient care.Knowledge Transfer Statement: This commentary highlights the research gaps in knowledge pertaining to the association between oral health and flavor and the significance of flavor to dental practice.","Ellender, G; Moynihan, P",JDR clinical and translational research,https://doi.org/10.1177/2380084421995096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588636/,614

MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients who underwent TAMIS at a single institution from December 2011 to December 2015 were retrospectively included in the study. Feasibility was based on tumor size, distance of tumor from the anal verge, operative time, and hospital stay. Thirty-day morbidity was defined by the revised Accordion Classification system. Histological outcome included microscopic resection margin status, specimen fragmentation status, and grading of dysplasia in rectal adenoma. RESULTS A total of 51 patients with rectal adenoma underwent TAMIS. The median tumor diameter was 32 (4-60) mm and the median distance from the anal verge 8 (3-14) cm. Median operative time was 40 (13-116) min and median length of hospital stay was 1 (0-25) days. Overall morbidity was 12% (four grade 1, one grade 2, and one grade 3 complications). 22% had a positive resection margin, whereas 31% had an indefinable resection margin status mostly due to tissue fragmentation. Median follow-up time was 7 (0-40) months. CONCLUSIONS TAMIS is a challenging surgical technique for treatment of rectal adenoma. Our initial experience among 51 patients resulted in a high proportion of positive resection margins and a high fragmentation rate. The role of TAMIS in the treatment of rectal adenoma is to be defined through comparative studies.","Haugvik, Sven-Petter; Groven, Sigrid; Bondi, Johan; Vågan, Torolf; Brynhildsvoll, Stig Ove; Olsen, Ole Christian",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3109/00365521.2016.1157891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27000415/,614

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an iatrogenic hematoma in the immediate vicinity of a peripheral nerve may cause histologic evidence of nerve injury. METHODS Fifty milliliters of autologous blood was injected adjacent to the right sciatic nerve in 20 anesthetized female pigs. In order to discern between blood-related volume and immune effects, 50 mL of albumin was injected at the same location in an additional 22 pigs. Either blood or albumin was injected in random order. The left sciatic nerve served as a negative control in all animals, that is, either no needle placement or needle placement without injection. After 48 hours, the nerves were resected. The grade of nerve injury was scored from 0 (no injury) to 3 (severe injury) by histologic analysis of myelin tissue and inflammatory cells. RESULTS Eighty-two nerve specimens were examined. Injury scores were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the blood injection (n = 20; median [interquartile range] 2 [2-2]) and albumin injection (n = 22, 1 [1-2]) conditions compared with the no needle placement (n = 22, 0 [0-1]) and ""dry needle placement"" (n = 20, 1 [0-1]) conditions. Widespread inflammatory changes were seen in the blood injection group, in which 15% of nerve specimens showed damage to myelin.

82155,Crisis Standards of Care: A Systems Framework for Catastrophic Disaster Response.,2016,"BACKGROUND Whether produced by breathing too fast or too deeply, hyperventilation is common in stressful situations and may contribute to blood donation-related vasovagal symptoms. The effects of some previously tested interventions for vasovagal symptoms, for example, applied tension (AT), may be related to reduction of hyperventilation. More targeted breathing techniques might be useful. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This was a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of AT, a slow, shallow ""anti-hyperventilation"" breathing technique previously tested in phobic individuals (respiration control [RESP]), the combination of AT and RESP, and no intervention on blood donors participating in university clinics. A total of 547 eligible donors were assigned randomly to one of these four groups. Observational, self-report, and physiologic measures (primarily via respiratory capnometry) were obtained. RESULTS Although both RESP and AT had some positive impact on blood donation outcome, the effects of RESP were more numerous, albeit limited primarily to donors who had less general fear of medical procedures. For example, lower-fear donors assigned to practice RESP had significantly lower Blood Donation Reaction Inventory scores and were significantly less likely to require treatment for symptoms than no-treatment individuals. In general, RESP led to a significant decrease in respiration rate, though it did not influence end-tidal CO2 , a more precise measure of hyperventilation. CONCLUSION While the mechanisms remain somewhat unclear and the interventions did not benefit more fearful, higher-risk donors, respiration control is a promising additional approach to reducing vasovagal symptoms.","Mennitto, Serena; Harrison, Johanna; Ritz, Thomas; Robillard, Pierre; France, Christopher R; Ditto, Blaine",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.15046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30488957/,614

METHODS This is a prospective randomized controlled trial from 2009 to 2013 comparing the use of thigh-high 30-40 mm Hg compression therapy for 7 days versus no compression therapy following EVA of the GSV. Severity of venous disease was measured by clinical severity, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology scale and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). Quality of life assessments were carried out with a Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ-2) at days 1, 7, 14, 30, and 90, and the Visual Analog Pain Scale daily for the first week. Bruising score was assessed at 1 week post procedure. Postablation venous duplex was also performed. RESULTS Seventy patients and 85 limbs with EVA were randomized. EVA modalities included radiofrequency ablation (91%) and laser ablation (9%). Clinical severity, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology class and VCSS scores were equivalent between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes of postprocedural pain scores at day 1 (mean 3.0 vs. 3.12, P = 0.948) and day 7 (mean 2.11 vs. 2.81, P = 0.147), CIVIQ-2 scores at 1 week (mean 36.9 vs. 35.1, P = 0.594) and 90 days (mean 29.1 vs. 22.5, P = 0.367), and bruising score (mean 1.2 vs. 1.4, P = 0.561) in the compression versus no compression groups, respectively. Additionally, there was a 100% rate of GSV closure in both groups and no endothermal heat-induced thrombosis as assessed by postablation duplex. CONCLUSIONS Compression therapy does not significantly affect both patient-reported and clinical outcomes after GSV ablation in patients with nonulcerated venous insufficiency. It may be an unnecessary adjunct following GSV ablation.","Ayo, Diego; Blumberg, Sheila N; Rockman, Caron R; Sadek, Mikel; Cayne, Neal; Adelman, Mark; Kabnick, Lowell; Maldonado, Thomas; Berland, Todd",Annals of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2016.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27554689/,614

In this study, we have aimed to delineate CAD-specific epigenetic signatures by investigating the methylation and expression of 11 candidate genes i.e. ABCG1, LIPC, PLTP, IL-6, TNF-α, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, F2RL3, FGF2, P66 and TGFBR3. The methylation-specific PCR and qRT-PCR were used to assess the methylation status and the expression of candidate genes, respectively. CAD patients showed the upregulation of IL-6, TNF-α, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, F2RL3, FGF2, P66, and TGFBR3. Hypomethylation of CDKN2A loci was shown to increase risk for CAD by 1.79-folds (95% CI 1.22-2.63). Classification and regression tree (CART) model of gene expression showed increased risk for CAD with F2RL3 > 3.4-fold, while demonstrating risk reduction with F2RL3 < 3.4-fold and IL-6 < 7.7-folds. This CAD prediction model showed the excellent sensitivity (0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.00), specificity (0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.92), positive predictive value (0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.84), and negative predictive value (0.99, 95% CI 0.94-1.00) with an overall accuracy of 92.8% (95% CI 87.0-94.1%). Folate and B12 deficiencies were observed in CAD cases, which were shown to contribute to hypomethylation and upregulation of the prime candidate genes i.e. CDKN2A and F2RL3. Early onset diabetes was associated with IL-6 and TNF-α hypomethylation and upregulation of CDKN2A. The expression of F2RL3 and IL-6 (or) hypomethylation status at CDKN2A locus are potential biomarkers in CAD risk prediction. Early epigenetic imprints of CAD were observed in early onset diabetes. Folate and B12 deficiencies are the contributing factors to these changes in CAD-specific epigenetic signatures.","Indumathi, Bobbala; Oruganti, Sai Satish; Naushad, Shaik Mohammad; Kutala, Vijay Kumar",Molecular biology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05723-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803503/,614

The aim of this study was to identify evidence-based barriers and solutions for CR participation in women. A literature search was carried out using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, OVID/Medline, and CINAHL to identify studies that have assessed barriers and/or solutions to CR participation. Titles and abstracts were screened, and then the full-text of articles that met study criteria were reviewed. We identified 24 studies that studied barriers to CR participation in women and 31 studies that assessed the impact of various interventions to improve CR referral, enrollment, and/or completion of CR in women. Patient-level barriers included lower education level, multiple comorbid conditions, non-English native language, lack of social support, and high burden of family responsibilities. We found support for the use of automatic referral and assisted enrollment to improve CR participation. A small number of studies suggest that incentive-based strategies, as well as home-based programs, may contribute to improving CR attendance and completion rates. A systematic approach to CR referral, including automatic CR referral, may help overcome barriers to CR referral in women and should be implemented in clinical practice.

87077,Anxiety in neurosurgical patients undergoing nonurgent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-12-01,"HIV testing is a critical component of effective HIV prevention and care. CDC recommends routine opt-out HIV testing in health care settings for all sexually active persons aged 13-64 years at least once in their lifetime and risk-based testing regardless of age for those who report behaviors associated with HIV acquisition (1). However, recent studies show low HIV testing rates in clinical settings; HIV testing rates at visits to physician offices did not increase during 2009-2016 (2). The objective of the current study is to estimate temporal trends in HIV testing among persons with commercial insurance or Medicaid from 2014 through 2019 and describe their demographic characteristics in 2019. Weighted data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database* (commercial insurance) and from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) claims database† (Medicaid) were analyzed to estimate the proportions of persons with commercial insurance or Medicaid who received testing for HIV. Testing rates increased among male and nonpregnant female persons aged ≥13 years with either type of coverage. In 2019, only 4.0% of those with commercial insurance and 5.5% of those with Medicaid received testing for HIV. Testing rates were higher among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. Based on mathematical modeling studies, these annual testing rates would need to increase at least threefold and be sustained over several years (3,4) to achieve the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) in the U.S. initiative goal of ≥95% of persons with HIV being aware of their infection by 2025.§ Interventions need to be implemented to increase routine and risk-based HIV testing in clinical settings to higher levels that can help reduce disparities in HIV diagnoses between Black and Hispanic persons compared with non-Hispanic White (White) persons (5). Increased HIV testing is essential to achieve the goals of the EHE initiative and reduce disparities in HIV diagnoses; public health should partner with health care systems to implement interventions that support increased testing.","Henny, Kirk D; Zhu, Weiming; Huang, Ya-Lin A; Townes, Ashley; Delaney, Kevin P; Hoover, Karen W",MMWR.

88800,Involving frail older patients in identifying outcome measures for transitional care-a feasibility study.,2021-06-03,"Organism size reduction with increasing temperature has been suggested as a universal response to global warming. Since genome size is usually correlated to cell size, reduction of genome size in unicells could be a parallel outcome of warming at ecological and evolutionary time scales. In this study, the short-term response of cell size and nucleic acid content of coastal marine prokaryotic communities to temperature was studied over a full annual cycle at a NE Atlantic temperate site. We used flow cytometry and experimental warming incubations, spanning a 6°C range, to analyze the hypothesized reduction with temperature in the size of the widespread flow cytometric bacterial groups of high and low nucleic acid content (HNA and LNA bacteria, respectively). Our results showed decreases in size in response to experimental warming, which were more marked in 0.8 μm pre-filtered treatment rather than in the whole community treatment, thus excluding the role of protistan grazers in our findings. Interestingly, a significant effect of temperature on reducing the average nucleic acid content (NAC) of prokaryotic cells in the communities was also observed. Cell size and nucleic acid decrease with temperature were correlated, showing a common mean decrease of 0.4% per °C. The usually larger HNA bacteria consistently showed a greater reduction in cell and NAC compared with their LNA counterparts, especially during the spring phytoplankton bloom period associated to maximum bacterial growth rates in response to nutrient availability. Our results show that the already smallest planktonic microbes, yet with key roles in global biogeochemical cycling, are likely undergoing important structural shrinkage in response to rising temperatures.","Huete-Stauffer, Tamara M; Arandia-Gorostidi, Nestor; Alonso-Sáez, Laura; Morán, Xosé Anxelu G",Frontiers in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27242747/,614

Engineered heteroplasmic mice with nonpathological mtDNA variants reveal a nonrandom tissue-specific mtDNA segregation pattern, with few tissues that do not show segregation. The driving force for this dynamic complex pattern has remained unexplained for decades, challenging our understanding of this fundamental biological problem and hindering clinical planning for inherited diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the nonrandom mtDNA segregation is an intracellular process based on organelle selection. This cell type-specific decision arises jointly from the impact of mtDNA haplotypes on the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and the cell metabolic requirements and is strongly sensitive to the nuclear context and to environmental cues.","Lechuga-Vieco, Ana Victoria; Latorre-Pellicer, Ana; Johnston, Iain G; Prota, Gennaro; Gileadi, Uzi; Justo-Méndez, Raquel; Acín-Pérez, Rebeca; Martínez-de-Mena, Raquel; Fernández-Toro, Jose María; Jimenez-Blasco, Daniel; Mora, Alfonso; Nicolás-Ávila, Jose A; Santiago, Demetrio J; Priori, Silvia G; Bolaños, Juan Pedro; Sabio, Guadalupe; Criado, Luis Miguel; Ruíz-Cabello, Jesús; Cerundolo, Vincenzo; Jones, Nick S; Enríquez, José Antonio",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832682/,614

As anticoagulation appeared to improve survival, hospital-wide recommendations regarding higher doses of anticoagulation was implemented 4/9/2020. OBJECTIVES To investigate if trends in D-dimer levels and platelet counts associated with death, thrombosis, and the shift in anticoagulation. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of 429 patients with COVID-19 at Karolinska University Hospital. Information on D-dimer levels and platelet counts was obtained from laboratory databases and clinical data from medical records. RESULTS Thirty-day mortality and thrombosis rate was 19% and 18%, respectively. Pulmonary embolism was common; 65/83 (78%). Increased D-dimer levels the first week in hospital were significantly associated with death and thrombosis (OR 6.06; 95% Cl 2.10-17.5, and 3.11; 95% CI 1.20-8.10, respectively). If platelet count increased more than 35×109/L per day, the mortality and thrombotic risk decreased (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.06-0.41, and OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.17-0.80). After implementation of updated hospital-wide recommendations, the daily mean significantly decreased regarding D-dimer levels while platelet counts rose; -1.93; 95% CI -1.00-2.87 mg/L FEU and 65; 95% CI 54-76 ×109/L and significant risk reductions for death and thrombosis were observed; OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.92 and 0.35; 95% CI 0.17-0.72. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to D-dimer levels, increase of platelet count over the first week in-hospital was associated with improved survival and reduced thrombotic risk. The daily mean levels of D-dimer dropped while the platelet counts rose, coinciding with increased anticoagulation and a decline in thrombotic burden and mortality.","Sjöström, Anna; Wersäll, Johanna; Warnqvist, Anna; Farm, Maria; Magnusson, Maria; Oldner, Anders; Ågren, Anna; Antovic, Jovan P; Bruzelius, Maria",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1477-3829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33831964/,614

The fistulous connection occurs within intraosseous diploic or transosseous emissary veins causing dilated intraosseous vascular pouches. To the authors' knowledge, this report describes the first percutaneous transfacial direct embolization of an intraosseous DAVF. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A man in his 50s with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome presented with headaches, imbalance, decreased visual acuity bilaterally, and left eye proptosis and chemosis. Imaging demonstrated an extensive intraosseous DAVF with dilated intraosseous vascular pouches throughout his cranial base and intraorbital venous congestion. He underwent staged endovascular treatment with the goal to improve his ocular symptoms. Transarterial and transvenous approaches failed to provide adequate access to the intraosseous vascular pouches. A direct, percutaneous transfacial approach was used to access the pouches for embolization with coils and liquid embolic material. Postoperative angiography demonstrated successful embolization of the pouch within the left pterygoid wing, reduced opacification of the intraosseous fistula, and elimination of intraorbital venous congestion. At 9-month follow-up, the patient's headaches had resolved, and his ocular symptomatology had improved. CONCLUSION Endovascular access to an intraosseous DAVF is limited by the size and location of the intraosseous vascular pouches. In this case, a direct transfacial approach under image guidance facilitated access and embolization, which led to an improvement in the patient's symptoms. This technique is a novel approach for DAVF management.","Nerva, John D; Hallam, Danial K; Ghodke, Basavaraj V",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24141481/,614

One reason for this ability is that they adopt a diversity of higher order structures in various eluents, resulting in versatile chiral environments. A potential to extend this versatility further was expected and examined in the present study, based on the recently discovered hysteretic behavior of a widely used chiral selector (CS), amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate). The hindered transitions of its structure, which are behind the history dependence of its separation ability, were used as a tool to identify distinct states of the chiral selector in order to exploit an extended selectivity space. The identification was carried out using a single diagnostic compound, as opposed to the common approach where testing a library of compounds is required. Eluent mixtures consisting of 2-propanol and either methanol or ethanol were scrutinized in terms of stability and robustness of the observed retentions. The solvent mixtures that were eligible for practical application in these respects were used to construct a screening sequence, including identical compositions combined with different column pretreatment. The gain achievable by using the proposed sequence was then evaluated using 15 enantiomer pairs with focus on resolution, enantiomer elution order and chemoselectivity.","Horváth, Simon; Eke, Zsuzsanna; Németh, Gábor",Journal of chromatography.

We aimed to review published cost-effectiveness analyses of lifestyle interventions compared with usual care on clinically relevant outcome measures. Five international and six grey-literature databases were searched from 2007 to 2018. Articles were assessed for quality of reporting. Data were extracted from healthcare and societal perspectives. Costs were adapted to the common currencies of Australia and the United Kingdom by adjusting for resource utilization, healthcare purchase price and changes in costs over time. Included studies were economic analyses of lifestyle interventions aiming to limit weight-gain during pregnancy and/or reduce risk of gestational diabetes, for women with a BMI of 25 or greater in pre- or early-pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS Of the 538 articles identified, six were retained for review: one modelling study and five studies in which an economic analysis was performed alongside a randomized-controlled trial. Outcome measures included infant birth-weight, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, gestational weight-gain, infant respiratory distress syndrome, perceived health, cost per case of adverse outcome avoided and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Interventions were cost-effective in only one study. Although many studies have investigated the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in pregnancy, few have included cost-effectiveness analyses. Where cost-effectiveness studies were undertaken, results were inconsistent. Secondary meta-analysis, taxonomy and framework research is now required to determine the effective components of lifestyle interventions and to guide future cost-effectiveness analyses.","Bailey, Cate; Skouteris, Helen; Teede, Helena; Hill, Briony; De Courten, Barbora; Walker, Ruth; Liew, Danny; Thangaratinam, Shakila; Ademi, Zanfina",Current diabetes reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11892-020-1288-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32008111/,614

In this study, we treated Malus prunifolia (MP) at four different stages of AR development, and analyzed the level of the endogenous hormones MT, auxin (IAA), zeatin-riboside (ZR), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellins (GA1 + 3) in all four treatment groups and the untreated control group. The expression of MT, IAA biosynthesis, transport and signal transduction, the cell cycle, and root development related genes were quantified by RT-qPCR. The function of MdWOX11 was analyzed in transgenic apple plants. RESULTS The promotion of AR development by MT was dependent on the stage of AR induction between 0 and 2 d in apple rootstocks. MT-treatment increased the level of IAA and crosstalk existed between MT and IAA during AR formation. The expression of MdWOX11 was induced by MT treatment and positively regulated AR formation in apple. Furthermore, transgenic lines that overexpressed MdWOX11 lines produced more ARs than 'GL3'. Phenotypic analysis indicated that MdWOX11 overexpression lines were more sensitive to exogenous MT treatment than 'GL3', suggesting that MdWOX11 regulates AR formation in response to MT in apple rootstock. CONCLUSIONS MT promotes AR formation mainly during the AR induction stage by inducing IAA levels and upregulating MdWOX11.","Mao, Jiangping; Niu, Chundong; Li, Ke; Chen, Shiyue; Tahir, Muhammad Mobeen; Han, Mingyu; Zhang, Dong",BMC plant biology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02747-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243138/,614

METHODS Between 2009 and 2012, a cohort of 78 consecutive patients (median age 60.5 years, 77% male) underwent ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) as a stand-alone procedure using a thoracoscopic, hybrid epicardial-endocardial technique. All patients underwent continuous 7-day Holter monitoring at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter. All patients reached 1-year follow-up. Median follow-up was 24 months [interquartile range 12-36]. RESULTS No death or conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass occurred. No patient demonstrated paralysis of the phrenic nerve. Overall, the incidence of perioperative complications was 8% (n=6). At the end of follow-up, sixty-eight patients (87%) were in sinus rhythm (SR) with no episode of AF, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia lasting longer than 30 seconds and off antiarrhythmic drugs (ADD). Among patients with long-standing persistent AF, 15 (100%) were in SR and off AAD. Success rates were 82% (n=28) in persistent and 76% (n=22) in paroxysmal AF (P=0.08). No patient died and no thromboembolic/bleeding events or procedure-related complications occurred during the follow-up.

METHODS Qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study with theoretical framework in the psychodynamics of work, carried out in the emergency and hospitalization sector of a national reference center for cancer treatment in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. The semi-structured interview was used to collect the data, from April to May 2020. The data were organized and analyzed using the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) method with the aid of the Qualiquantisoft® software. RESULTS Twenty members of the nursing team participated (10 nurses and 10 nursing technicians). After the analysis, three CSDs with their respective central ideas (CI) emerged. The CSD software, Qualiquantisoft®, also provided a quantitative analysis of the responses, in which 12 (60%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with work organization, 6 (30%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated to work relationships and 2 (10%) of respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with working conditions. CONCLUSIONS The adaptations that took place in the management of care and in the organization of work, to better serve patients in oncology palliative care with suspicions and confirmed for COVID-19, brought greater impact and psychological stress on the nursing team.

For infants born in non-tertiary centres, TH may be initiated manually en route to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, both over- and undercooling is reported with this strategy, precluding some infants from the benefits of TH. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of a region-wide educational programme on the safety and efficacy of manual cooling administered by the Wellington Neonatal Transport Service (NeTS). METHODS Clinical records of infants with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) retrieved by the Wellington NeTS for TH between January 2012 and June 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Temperature outcomes of infants retrieved before and after the education programme were compared. RESULTS A total of 101 infants were cooled manually by Wellington NeTS for TH during the study period. Education and training significantly reduced the rate of overcooling to ≤32.0°C (4/43 [9%] vs. 0/58, p = 0.02). However, there was no difference in the proportion of infants who achieved target rectal temperature within 6 h of life (29/43 [65%] vs. 35/58 [60%], p = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS Introduction of a region-wide educational programme may have improved the safety of manual cooling during neonatal transport but it had a negligible impact on its efficacy. The use of servo-controlled cooling during transport should therefore be considered to improve access to the optimal neuroprotective benefits of TH for outborn infants with HIE.","Saito-Benz, Maria; Cody, Sarah; Dineen, Fiona; Mladenovic, Jelena; Berry, Mary J",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000495688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889592/,614
96427,Seeking out SARI: an automated search of electronic health records.,2018,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of skipping breakfast on body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS This study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating breakfast skipping compared with breakfast consumption. Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 18, intervention duration ≥ 4 weeks, ≥ 7 participants per group, and ≥ 1 body composition measure. Random-effects meta-analyses of the effect of breakfast skipping on body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors were performed. RESULTS Seven RCTs (n = 425 participants) with an average duration of 8.6 weeks were included. Compared with breakfast consumption, breakfast skipping significantly reduced body weight (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.54 kg [95% CI: -1.05 to -0.03], P = 0.04, I2 = 21.4%). Percent body fat was reported in 5 studies and was not significantly different between breakfast skippers and consumers. Three studies reported on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), which was increased in breakfast skippers as compared with breakfast consumers (WMD = 9.24 mg/dL [95% CI: 2.18 to 16.30], P = 0.01). Breakfast skipping did not lead to significant differences in blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, insulin, fasting glucose, leptin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, or ghrelin. CONCLUSIONS Breakfast skipping may have a modest impact on weight loss and may increase LDL in the short term. Further studies are needed to provide additional insight into the effects of breakfast skipping.","Bonnet, Jonathan P; Cardel, Michelle I; Cellini, Jaqueline; Hu, Frank B; Guasch-Ferré, Marta",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304359/,614

96639,Ethics of Midwifery Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND We have theorized that clots with stasis are longer. We therefore explored the relationship between thrombus imaging characteristics on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with clot length and pial collaterals on baseline computed tomography angiography (CTA). METHODS Prospective study of acute ischemic stroke patients (2005-2009) from Keimyung University. Patients with known stroke symptom onset time, baseline CTA, MRI, and with M1-Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)±intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions were included. Clot length and pial collaterals were measured on baseline CTA. RESULTS A total of 104 patients (mean age 65.1±12.28 years, 56.7% male, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 13) with intracranial ICA + MCA (n=50) or isolated M1-MCA (n=54) occlusions were included. Hyperdense sign on NCCT had a median clot length of 42.3 mm versus 29.5 mm when hyperdense negative (p=0.02). Clots showing blooming artifact on gradient recall echo MRI had a median length of 39.1 mm versus 24.5 mm without blooming (p=0.005). Patients with poor baseline collaterals on CTA had longer clots than those with intermediate/good collaterals (median clot length 49.4 mm vs 34.9 mm vs 20.5 mm respectively, p<0.001). In censored logistic regression modeling, clot length was an independent predictor of hyperdense sign (p=0.05) and of the presence of blooming artifact (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS Clot length and baseline collateral status are independent predictors of clot hyperdensity on NCCT and blooming artifact on gradient recall echo. Longer clots are more likely to be hyperdense and to bloom more, probably because portions of these clots are freshly formed locally due to of stasis of blood around the original clot. This stasis could be because of poor collaterals and inefficient angio-architecture within the cerebral arterial tree.","Qazi, Emmad M; Sohn, Sung Il; Mishra, Sachin; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Eesa, Muneer; d'Esterre, Christopher D; Qazi, Abdul A; Puig, Josep; Goyal, Mayank; Demchuk, Andrew M; Menon, Bijoy K",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

METHODS Data from 331 participants within the service and manufacturing sector in the Flemish Employees' Physical Activity (FEPA) study were used, with objective measures of OPA and subjective measures of physical and psychosocial work environment. A modified Nordic questionnaire collected data on LBP and NSP. RESULTS LBP (> 30 days over a year) was reported by 25% of participants, NSP (> 30 days over a year) by 30% and the composite measure of LBP/NSP simultaneously by 17%. Objective measures of OPA were not significantly associated with any pain groups. In the final model, self-reported physical demands were associated with NSP (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.30-3.18) and LBP/NSP (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.16-3.45) but not LBP. Job control was negatively associated with LBP (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99) and LBP/NSP (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3-0.98). CONCLUSION Objective measures were not associated with LBP or NSP. Self-reported measures provided insights into potential workplace hazards such as physical demands and job control which can be used to inform future strategies to prevent the development of LBP and NSP.","Oakman, Jodi; Ketels, Margo; Clays, Els",International archives of occupational and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01707-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974143/,614

The structures of 1 and 2 were assigned by spectroscopic and HRESIMS data analyses. The axial chirality of 1 was determined by electronic circular dichroism data analysis, and the absolute configurations of 2 and 3 were determined by X-ray crystallography. The axial chirality of 7 was determined by UV-induced photooxidation from 4. Compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed inhibitory activity against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in 293T-ACE2 cells with IC50 values of 0.17, 0.038, and 0.12 μM. Compounds 4 and 5 were also active against live SARS-CoV-2 infection with EC50 values of 0.22 and 0.21 μM, respectively. Further cell-cell fusion assays, surface plasmon resonance assays, and molecular docking studies revealed that 4 and 5 could bind with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to prevent its interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor.

98622,Health Anxiety and Emotion Regulation during the Period of COVID-19 Outbreak in Turkey.,2020,"An increase in population, rapid urbanization and industrialization has accelerated the rate of municipal solid waste generation. The current disposal of solid waste is a burgeoning issue and it's in immediate need to shift the existing disposal processes to a sustainable manner. Circular economy (CE) is a conceptual model which is been used for better use of resources and minimization of waste in a closed loop approach which could be appropriate for waste management. In this context, the present review illustrates the effective use of biodegradable and non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste in a closed loop integrated refinery platforms for the recovery of bioenergy resources and for the production of value added products. The biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be treated by advanced biological processes with the simultaneous production of bioenergy such as biohydrogen, biomethane, bioelectricity, etc., and other value added products like butanol, ethanol, methanol etc. The scheme illustrates the closed loop approach, the bioenergy generated from the biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for the operation of internal combustion engines and the energy could be further used for processing the waste. The non-biodegradable fraction of solid waste could be used for construction and pavement processes. Overall the study emphasizes the paradigm shift of solid waste management concepts from linear economy to a circular economy following the ""Zero Waste"" concept. The study also explains the circular economy policies practiced for solid waste management that stimulates the economy of the country and identify the pathways to maximize the local resources. In addition the review addresses the advanced information and communication technologies to unfold the issues and challenges faced in the solid waste management. The smart governance of managing waste using the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) is one of the great precursors of technological development that could lead innovations in waste management.","Velvizhi, G; Shanthakumar, S; Das, Bhaskar; Pugazhendhi, A; Priya, T Shanmuga; Ashok, B; Nanthagopal, K; Vignesh, R; Karthick, C",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408201/,614

Utilization of health personnel in developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-05-29,"Recently, the novel life-threatening coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was reported at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread throughout the world in little time. The effective antiviral activities of natural products have been proved in different studies. In this review, regarding the effective herbal treatments on other coronavirus infections, promising natural products for COVID-19 treatment are suggested. An extensive search in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, ISI, and Scopus was done with search words include coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS, MERS, natural product, herb, plant, and extract. The consumption of herbal medicine such as Allium sativum, Camellia sinensis, Zingiber officinale, Nigella sativa, Echinacea spp. Hypericum perforatum, and Glycyrrhiza glabra, Scutellaria baicalensis can improve the immune response. It seems that different types of terpenoids have promising effects in viral replication inhibition and could be introduced for future studies. Additionally, some alkaloid structures such as homoharringtonine, lycorine, and emetine have strong anti-coronavirus effects. Natural products can inhibit different coronavirus targets such as S protein (emodin, baicalin) and viral enzymes replication such as 3CLpro (Iguesterin), PLpro (Cryptotanshinone), helicase (Silvestrol), and RdRp (Sotetsuflavone).

100151,Global Health Diplomacy: A New Strategic Defense Pillar.,2017,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) currently spreads in humans and causes ∼ 36% fatality in infected patients. Believed to have originated from bats, MERS-CoV is genetically related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. To understand how bat coronaviruses transmit to humans, we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry activity of the virus-surface spike proteins of HKU4 and HKU5. We found that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but not HKU5. Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells. Thus, MERS-CoV, but not HKU4, has adapted to use human DPP4 and human cellular proteases for efficient human cell entry, contributing to the enhanced pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in humans. These results establish DPP4 as a functional receptor for HKU4 and host cellular proteases as a host range determinant for HKU4. They also suggest that DPP4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human health because of their spikes' capability to adapt to human cells for cross-species transmissions.","Yang, Yang; Du, Lanying; Liu, Chang; Wang, Lili; Ma, Cuiqing; Tang, Jian; Baric, Ralph S; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Fang",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405889111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25114257/,614
100543,Fall of amalgam restoration: a ten years analysis of an Australian university dental clinic.,2020-11-16,"INTRODUCTION Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. METHODS Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). CONCLUSIONS Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.","Pazmiño Erazo, Edgar Efraín; Alvear Velásquez, María José; Saltos Chávez, Ivonne Gisselle; Pazmiño Pullas, David Emanuel",Revista colombiana de psiquiatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735001/,614

We extend the existing literature in: (i) considering supply capacity as a market outcome alongside price and quality; (ii) taking account of the chain structure of care home supply and differences between the nursing home and residential care home sectors; (iii) using an econometric approach based on reduced form relationships that treats market concentration as a jointly determined outcome of a complex market. We find that areas susceptible to a high degree of market concentration tend to have greatly restricted supply of care home places and (to a lesser extent) a higher average public cost, than areas susceptible to low degree of market concentration. There is no significant evidence that conditions favoring high market concentration affect average care home quality.","Espuny Pujol, Ferran; Hancock, Ruth; Hviid, Morten; Morciano, Marcello; Pudney, Stephen",Health economics,https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966316/,614

The aim was to identify factors influencing clinical outcome in elderly patients with anterior circulation AIS treated with MT (±intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)). In a retrospective, monocentric study, analysis of prospectively collected data of 138 patients (≥80 years) was performed. IVT was an independent negative predictor (OR 0.356; 95% CI: 0.134-0.942) and female sex an independent positive predictor (OR 4.179, 95% CI: 1.300-13.438) of 3-month good clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale 0-2). Female sex was also an independent negative predictor of 3-month mortality (OR 0.244, 95% CI: 0.100-0.599). Other independent negative predictors of 3-month good clinical outcome were older age, lower pre-stroke self-sufficiency, more severe neurological deficit and longer procedural intervals. Mortality was also independently predicted by longer procedural interval and by the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (p < 0.05 in all cases). Our results demonstrated, that in patients aged ≥80 years with anterior circulation AIS undergoing MT (±IVT), IVT reduced the chance of 3-month good clinical outcome and female sex was associated with a greater likelihood of 3-month good clinical outcome and lower probability of 3-month mortality.","Krajíčková, Dagmar; Krajina, Antonín; Herzig, Roman; Vyšata, Oldřich; Šimůnek, Libor; Vališ, Martin",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575377/,614

This could be related to a reduction in the occurrence of arrhythmias, which may result from modifications of the hibernating myocardium in a CTO region. METHODS AND RESULTS We aimed to evaluate the effect of CTO PCI on electrophysiological parameters, and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Titles and abstracts identified by the search strategy were independently screened by two investigators. Data were extracted and used for meta-analyses where possible. In total, eight studies incorporating 467 patients were included in this review, evaluating the effect of successful CTO PCI on various ECG parameters. Three studies showed a significant decrease in mean QT dispersion of 17.46ms [95% CI 10.62-24.30] after successful CTO PCI. QTc dispersion also decreased significantly, with a mean decrease of 18.74ms [95% CI 11.53-25.94]. In one trial a significant decrease in Tp-e interval in leads V2 and V5, and a significant decrease in Tp-e/QT ratio in leads V2 and V5 post-CTO PCI were observed. CONCLUSIONS This first systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that successful CTO PCI is associated with an immediate decrease in ECG parameters that reflect heterogeneity in depolarization and repolarization, which could lead to a reduction in the risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We raise the hypothesis that hibernating myocardium in a CTO region may not be as deeply ""in sleep"" as one would assume.","van Dongen, Ivo M; Elias, Joëlle; Meijborg, Veronique M F; De Bakker, Jacques M T; Limpens, Jacqueline; Conrath, Chantal E; Henriques, José P S",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carrev.2017.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29066338/,614

Throughout a keen analysis of the World Health Organization (WHO) most updated data, a gender-specific difference in the occurrence of infection was determined, which seems to correlate with patient's vitamin D status. Therefore, our purpose is to provide insights into the nutritional importance of vitamin D for its immunomodulatory effect, in order to help counteracting the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel interesting findings suggest that vitamin D, by inducing progesterone-induced blocking factor (PIBF), might regulate the immune response and also modulate cytokine IL-6, which appears to be increased in COVID-19 infections. Therefore, in addition to the standard recommendations to prevent the infection, supplementation of vitamin D might be considered an approach to help counteracting this global epidemic.","Orrù, B; Szekeres-Bartho, J; Bizzarri, M; Spiga, A M; Unfer, V",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767348/,614

We examined bereaved families' perceptions of the quality of end-of-life communication among Veterans, families and staff in Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Qualitative descriptive study using data from a survey of bereaved family members of Veterans administered from March-June 2020. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. SETTING VA medical centers with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases during the study period. PARTICIPANTS Next-of-kin of 328 Veterans who died in one of 37 VA medical centers' acute care, intensive care, nursing home, or hospice units. MEASUREMENTS Open-ended survey questions (response rate = 37%) about family member's perceptions of: 1) communication with the healthcare team about the patient, 2) communication with the patient, and 3) use of remote communication technologies. RESULTS Bereaved family members identified contextual factors perceived to impact communication quality including: allowing family at the bedside when death is imminent, fears that the patient died alone, and overall perceptions of VA care. Characteristics of perceived high-quality communication included staff availability for remote communication and being kept informed of the patient's condition and plan of care. Low-quality communication with staff was perceived to result from limited access to staff, insufficient updates regarding the patient's condition, and when the family member was not consulted about care decision-making. Communication quality with the patient was facilitated or impeded by the availability and use of video-enabled remote technologies. CONCLUSION Communication between patients, families, and healthcare teams at the end of life remains critically important during times of limited in-person visitation. Families report that low-quality communication causes profound distress that can affect the quality of dying and bereavement. Innovative strategies are needed to ensure that high-quality communication occurs despite pandemic-related visitation restrictions.","Feder, Shelli; Smith, Dawn; Griffin, Hilary; Shreve, Scott T; Kinder, Daniel; Kutney-Lee, Ann; Ersek, Mary",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320956/,614

RESULTS Eighty-seven people with PD (mean = 70 [7.3] years old) and 43 instructors (51 [12.1] years old) from the United States completed surveys (October 2020 to February 2021). Mean Schwab-England (84 [16]) and PDQ-8 (21 [15]) scores indicated low-to-moderate disability in the PD group. Ninety-five percent of the PD group had COVID-19 exposure concerns and 54% reported leaving home ≤1/week. While 77% of the PD group scored ""active"" on the GLTQ, the mean SEE score (55 [24]) indicated only moderate exercise self-efficacy, and > 50% reported decreased exercise quantity/intensity compared to pre-COVID. There was decreased in-person and increased virtual class participation for both groups. The top in-person class barrier for the PD (63%) and instructor (51%) groups was fear of participant COVID-19 exposure. The top virtual class barriers were lack of socialization (20% of PD group) and technology problems (74% of instructor group). CONCLUSIONS During COVID-19 there has been less in-person and more virtual exercise class participation in people with PD, and decreased exercise quantity and intensity. Virtual classes may not fully meet the needs of people with PD, and primary barriers include technology and lack of socialization. IMPACT As COVID-19 restrictions wane, it is imperative to help people with PD increase exercise and activity. The barriers, needs, and facilitators identified in this study might help inform approaches to increase participation in exercise and activity for people with PD. LAY SUMMARY During COVID-19, there has been less in-person and more virtual exercise class participation in people with PD-and a decrease in exercise quantity and intensity. If you have PD, virtual classes might not fully meet your needs. Primary barriers may include technology problems and lack of social interaction.","Mañago, Mark M; Swink, Laura A; Hager, Emily R; Gisbert, Robyn; Earhart, Gammon M; Christiansen, Cory L; Schenkman, Margaret",Physical therapy,https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzab203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34473303/,614
104715,Mohs Micrographic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Considering the Patient Perspective.,2021-05-01,"Acanthamoeba is an opportunistic protozoan pathogen which is found in diverse environment worldwide. Being ubiquitous nature of this amoeba we come across it in our daily life. Acanthamoeba species are recognized as human pathogens; that may cause blinding keratitis and rare but fatal granulomatous encephalitis involving central nervous system. To date, there is not a single report in literature demonstrating anti-Acanthamoeba antibodies among the Saudi population, and thus aim of the present study. Using ELISA, we identified the antibody level in the local population. Our results represent the secretory IgA antiAcanthamoeba in mucosal secretions from 133 individuals aged 15-60 years. The antiAcanthamoeba antibody prevalence rate was > 80%, and no considerable differences were observed between prevalence in males (80.28%) and that in females (80.64%). In addition, environmental sources (soil and water) from the environment of the participants in our study were evaluated for amoeba incidence. The amoeba was identified by morphological characteristics of cysts or trophozoites on non-nutrient agar plates grown with E. coli. Overall, 58.75% of samples from water and 32.85% of those from soil were culture positive for outgrowth of amoeba on non-nutrient agar plates. Furthermore, PCR was carried out with genus-specific primers to confirm the presence of Acanthamoeba DNA. Our results revealed that about 68% of cultures from water and 43% of those from soil were successfully amplified and proved to be amoeba DNA. Interestingly, a few samples yielded more than one product, which suggests that some other amoebic species may be present in the same sample (MAC-W1 and MADW1). To the best of our knowledge, we described for the first time the amoeba isolation from the participant's close environment and antibodies level among Saudi population. Our future studies will be focused on additional molecular characterization of isolated amoeba and their pathogenic potential which could be a possible threat for the community.","Alouffi, A S; Dawoud, T M; Almaary, K S; Mubarak, A S; JarAllah, K; Matin, A",Tropical biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.47665/tb.38.1.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797527/,614

This explains why there is no gold standard for monitoring the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) and why experimental studies may use several electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, ranging from 2 to 128 EEG-channels. Our study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to be the Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC- of 0.93 ± 0.04). This finding may pave the way to improve the assessment of DoA by combining one EEG channel recordings with a multimodal physiological monitoring of the brain state under GA. Further work is needed to see if these results may be valid to asses the depth of sedation in ICU.","Dubost, Clement; Humbert, Pierre; Benizri, Arno; Tourtier, Jean-Pierre; Vayatis, Nicolas; Vidal, Pierre-Paul",Frontiers in computational neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2019.00065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632257/,614

105806,Protecting newborn infants during the COVID-19 pandemic should be based on evidence and equity.,2020-09-07,"OBJECTIVES Energy-based tissue fusion technology is being increasingly used for vascular division in numerous intra-abdominal applications. Very few data, however, are available regarding the application of this technology in the chest during anatomic lung resection. In the present review, we evaluated the use of energy-based fusion and lung sealants during anatomic lung resection. METHODS We performed a review of case series and published studies to evaluate the use of energy-based coagulative fusion technology and lung sealants during anatomic lung resection. We then used energy-based coagulative fusion technology during anatomic lung resection (segmentectomy or lobectomy) in 316 cases from 2008 to 2011. Two energy applications were applied to the arterial and venous branches before vessel division. RESULTS In the first 12 cases, we used a device with a small curved jaw (range, 3.3-4.7 mm). Two partial venous dehiscences were noted and controlled intraoperatively. For the remaining cases, we used a larger jaw (6 mm × 22 mm) with no arterial or venous dehiscence occurring (vessels ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 cm). Autologous or synthetic tissue sealants applied to the parenchymal staple lines might reduce the severity and duration of perioperative air leaks. Suture line buttressing with pericardial or absorbable biosynthetic polyester strips might reduce the severity of air leaks in patients with severe emphysema undergoing anatomic lung resection or lung volume reduction surgery. CONCLUSIONS The bipolar tissue fusion system provides a safe and effective technique for the division of the pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection. Surgical sealants and buttressing adjuncts might reduce perioperative air leak potential.","Schuchert, Matthew J; Abbas, Ghulam; Landreneau, Joshua P; Luketich, James D; Landreneau, Rodney J",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22898526/,614

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between triploid and full-sib diploid poplar trees were identified from two transcriptomic data sets followed by a gene association study among DEGs to identify key leaf growth regulators. Yeast one-hybrid system, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and dual-luciferase assay were employed to substantiate that PpnGRF5-1 directly regulated PpnCKX1. The interactions between PpnGRF5-1 and GRF-interacting factors were experimentally validated and a multilayered hierarchical regulatory network (ML-hGRN)-mediated by PpnGRF5-1 was constructed with Top-down GGM algorithm by combining RNA-seq data from its overexpression (OE) lines and DAP-seq data. PpnGRF5-1 is a negative regulator of PpnCKX1. OE of PpnGRF5-1 in diploid transgenic lines resulted in larger leaves resembling those of triploids, and significantly increased zeatin and isopentenyladenine in the apical buds and third leaves. PpnGRF5-1 also interacted with GIFs to increase its regulatory diversity and capacity. An ML-hGRN-mediated by PpnGRF5-1 was obtained and could largely elucidate larger leaves. PpnGRF5-1 and the ML-hGRN-mediated by PpnGRF5-1 were underlying the leaf growth and development.","Wu, Wenqi; Li, Jiang; Wang, Qiao; Lv, Kaiwen; Du, Kang; Zhang, Wenli; Li, Quanzi; Kang, Xiangyang; Wei, Hairong",The New phytologist,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423287/,614

Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a well-defined 22 mm hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney, located close to the renal hilum. Plasma rennin activity was elevated (75 ng/mL/h), and reninoma was diagnosed. Retroperitoneoscopy-assisted nephron-sparing surgery was planned. The retroperitoneum was accessed through a 4 cm left pararectal upper abdominal incision. Following blunt dissection, the abdominal wall was elevated with a lifting bar and lifting retractor, inserted below the 12th rib in the anterior axillary line to create sufficient working space in the retroperitoneal cavity without the need for pneumoperitoneum. Three 5 mm trocars were introduced above the superior iliac crest for the camera and the assistant. Gerota's fascia was opened and the kidney exposed. The surgeon dissected the left kidney through the minilaparotomy incision under both direct vision and using the magnified view on the monitor, which was particularly effective for the lateral and posterior sides of the kidney. The posterior peritoneum was incised intentionally next to the diaphragm to allow further mobilization of the kidney. Diathermy was used to remove the tumor and a layer of surrounding normal parenchymal tissue at least 0.5 cm thick. The histopathologic diagnosis was reninoma. Ischemia time was 14 minutes. Postoperatively, both plasma rennin activity and blood pressure were normal (1.9 ng/mL/h and 90-110/70-80 mm Hg, respectively).

Cooling strategies to attenuate PPE-induced heat strain during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-06-10,"The existence of a causal relationship between the raise of death rate in COVID-19 infected patients and their sufferance from non-communicable pathophysiological conditions, particularly chronic diseases was recently evidenced. In fact, in addition to the immunodeficiency generated by chronic diseases conditions, COVID-19 led also to affect the immune system. Furthermore, the novel coronavirus attacks the lungs and other vital organs such as heart, kidneys, and brain. All these outcomes are accused to be involved in the increasing vulnerability and comorbidity in COVID-19-infected people with chronic diseases. Pharmacological, dietetic and natural approaches were suggested after a deep bibliographic research for presenting preventive recommendations for this category of patients in order to avoid the fatal complications of this infection, and consequently limiting the risk of comorbidity. In this regard, some medications could enter in interaction with COVID-19 infection in patients with diabetes or hypertension and thereafter lead to fatal complications. Furthermore, regarding their nutritional values some foods are more useful than others during this pandemic period because they are rich on vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and perhaps on some bioactive phytochemicals which are known be effective in improving immune response, managing chronic diseases and/or having antiviral activities. In addition, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, prebiotics and probiotics could be helpful in these conditions. Interestingly, in order to understand the mechanism of this causality and suggesting efficacious solutions, this review deserves considerable epidemiologic, clinical and experimental investigations.","Ajebli, Mohammed; Amssayef, Ayoub; Akdad, Mourad; Algharrass, Youness; Babakhouya, Abdelaadim; Ghanimi, Dris; Eddouks, Mohamed","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530320666201201110148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33261545/,614

Analysis of the TS ion-feature revealed anticorrelated modulations in the density of the two ion streams at the spatial scale of the ion skin depth c/ω_{pi}=120 μm, and a correlated modulation in the plasma current. The inferred current profile implies a magnetic field amplitude ∼30±6 T, corresponding to ∼1% of the flow kinetic energy, indicating that magnetic trapping is the dominant saturation mechanism.","Swadling, G F; Bruulsema, C; Fiuza, F; Higginson, D P; Huntington, C M; Park, H-S; Pollock, B B; Rozmus, W; Rinderknecht, H G; Katz, J; Birkel, A; Ross, J S",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.215001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530650/,614

In this study, our objective was to determine whether a narrower gastric conduit would lead to lower incidence of anastomotic leakage following MIO. METHODS In this retrospective study, patients with oesophageal cancer undergoing MIO were assigned to receive 5-cm-wide gastric conduits (from May 2011 to February 2012, Group W) and then 3-cm-wide gastric conduits (from March 2012 to December 2012, Group N) for gastro-oesophageal anastomosis. The length of the gastric conduit and the anastomotic details were recorded during surgery. Perfusion status of the conduit was analysed before and after anastomosis using a laser Doppler perfusion monitor. Following surgery, the incidence of anastomotic leakage in the two groups was statistically compared to identify differences between the two methods of gastric formation. RESULTS There were 126 patients in Group N and 133 patients in Group W. Patient demographics and surgical observations were comparable between the two groups. In Group N, the length of gastric conduit was significantly greater than in Group W (39.1 ± 2.7 vs 35.6 ± 4.4 cm, P = 0.0021). Lower reduction of perfusion units was recorded in Group N after gastro-oesophageal anastomosis (45.7 vs 28.1%, P = 0.004). Postoperatively, a total of 34 cases (13.13%) of anastomotic leakage was observed, and the incidence of anastomotic leakage was significantly lower in Group N than in Group W (8.7 vs 17.3%, P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS Narrow gastric tubes were longer and less interfered in perfusion, which contributed to lower incidence of anastomotic leakage following minimally invasive oesophagectomy.

110484,COVID-19 and suicide.,2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND Achalasia patients with longstanding disease are considered to be at risk for developing esophageal cancer. Endoscopic screening is not standardized and detection of dysplastic lesions is difficult, for which Lugol chromoendoscopy could be helpful. Aim was to evaluate the efficacy of screening for esophageal dysplasia and carcinoma in patients with longstanding achalasia using Lugol chromoendoscopy. METHODS In this cohort study achalasia patients underwent three-annual screening by Lugol chromoendoscopy between January 2000 and March 2016. Patients with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) underwent yearly screening, patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or carcinoma were treated. RESULTS In total, 230 achalasia patients (144 male, median age 52 years (IQR 43-63) at first endoscopy) were included. Three patients (1.3%, 2 male, age 68 years (range 50-87)) developed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), without LGD at the preceding screening. Incidence rate for ESCC was 63 (95% CI 13-183) per 100 000 persons-years. LGD was observed in 4 patients (1.7%, 2 male, age 64 years (range 57-73)), without progression to HGD/ESCC during a follow-up of 9 (IQR 7-14) years. ESCC/LGD was diagnosed 30 (IQR 14-36) years after onset of symptoms and 22 (IQR 4-13) years after diagnosis. Lugol chromoendoscopy tripled the detection rate of suspected lesions (111 lesions white light versus 329 lesions Lugol), but only 8% was histopathological confirmed ESCC or LGD. CONCLUSION Achalasia patients with longstanding disease (>20 years) have an increased risk to develop esophageal dysplasia and carcinoma. Endoscopic screening using white light and Lugol chromoendoscopy does not accurately identify precursor lesions for ESCC and therefore cannot be systematically recommended.","Ponds, Fraukje A; Moonen, An; Smout, André J P M; Rohof, Wout O A; Tack, Jan; van Gool, Stijn; Bisschops, Raf; Bredenoord, Albert J; Boeckxstaens, Guy E",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41395-018-0064-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29748564/,614

Other aims were to report and evaluate the utility of clinical investigations performed, and describe any effect of treatment before referral on temperature at presentation and ability to make a diagnosis. METHODS Clinical records of cats with pyrexia (⩾39.2°C) documented at least twice were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were assigned to disease categories (infectious, inflammatory, immune-mediated, neoplastic, miscellaneous and no diagnosis [pyrexia of unknown origin, PUO]) based on diagnosis. The overall value of clinical investigations was assessed by classifying them as 'enabling', 'assisting' or 'no assistance' in achieving each diagnosis. The effect of treatment before referral was assessed for any association with temperature at presentation and ability to make a diagnosis (PUO vs other disease categories). RESULTS One hundred and six cases were identified. The most common cause of pyrexia was feline infectious peritonitis (22 cats, 20.8%) and the largest disease category was infectious (41/106, 38.7%). Inflammatory conditions were found in 19 (17.9%) cats, neoplasia in 13 (12.3%), miscellaneous causes in 11 (10.4%) and immune-mediated disease in six (5.7%). No diagnosis was reached in 16 (15.0%) cats, often despite extensive diagnostic investigations. Cytology and histopathology most often 'enabled' or 'assisted' in obtaining a diagnosis. Most cats (91, 85.8%) received treatment before referral, with antimicrobial treatment given to 87 (82.1%). Prior treatment before referral was not associated with temperature at presentation nor with success in establishing a diagnosis.

Here, we show that coronavirus vaccines elicit cross-protective immune responses against heterologous coronaviruses. In particular, we show that a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) vaccine developed in 2004 and known to protect against SARS-CoV-1, confers robust heterologous protection against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. Similarly, prior coronavirus infections conferred heterologous protection against distinct coronaviruses. Cross-reactive immunity was also reported in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and humans who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and transfer of plasma from these individuals into mice improved protection against coronavirus challenges. These findings provide the first demonstration that coronavirus vaccines (and prior coronavirus infections) can confer broad protection against heterologous coronaviruses, providing a rationale for universal coronavirus vaccines.","Dangi, Tanushree; Palacio, Nicole; Sanchez, Sarah; Park, Mincheol; Class, Jake; Visvabharathy, Lavanya; Ciucci, Thomas; Koralnik, Igor J; Richner, Justin M; Penaloza-MacMaster, Pablo",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci151969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623973/,614

METHODS We screened for RIAC and feeding hypoxemia among infants with a gestational age of 36 weeks or greater using pulse oximetry. We investigated the infants who showed hypoxemia with a decrease in SpO2 to less than 70% and bradycardia with a heart rate of less than 100 beats per minute caused by GER. We then evaluated the relationships between these events and both RIAC and feeding hypoxemia. RESULTS We examined 250 infants in the present study. RIAC and feeding hypoxemia were observed in 35 (14.0%), and 30 (12.0%) infants, respectively. Ten infants showed hypoxemia and bradycardia caused by GER. These events were correlated with RIAC (p = 0.006) and feeding hypoxemia (p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS In the infants with RIAC and feeding hypoxemia, some show severe hypoxemia and bradycardia caused by GER.

114512,Effect of COVID-19 disruptions on young adults' affect and substance use in daily life.,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND Medication adherence is critical to the effectiveness of psychopharmacologic therapy. Psychiatric disorders present special adherence considerations, notably an altered capacity for decision making and the increased street value of controlled substances. A wide range of interventions designed to improve adherence in mental health and substance use disorders have been studied; recently, many have incorporated information technology (eg, mobile phone apps, electronic pill dispensers, and telehealth). Many intervention components have been studied across different disorders. Furthermore, many interventions incorporate multiple components, making it difficult to evaluate the effect of individual components in isolation. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic scoping review to develop a literature-driven, transdiagnostic taxonomic framework of technology-based medication adherence intervention and measurement components used in mental health and substance use disorders. METHODS This review was conducted based on a published protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42018067902) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review guidelines. We searched 7 electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Engineering Village, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2000 to September 2018. Overall, 2 reviewers independently conducted title and abstract screens, full-text screens, and data extraction. We included all studies that evaluate populations or individuals with a mental health or substance use disorder and contain at least 1 technology-delivered component (eg, website, mobile phone app, biosensor, or algorithm) designed to improve medication adherence or the measurement thereof. Given the wide variety of studied interventions, populations, and outcomes, we did not conduct a risk of bias assessment or quantitative meta-analysis. We developed a taxonomic framework for intervention classification and applied it to multicomponent interventions across mental health disorders. RESULTS The initial search identified 21,749 results; after screening, 127 included studies remained (Cohen kappa: 0.8, 95% CI 0.72-0.87). Major intervention component categories include reminders, support messages, social support engagement, care team contact capabilities, data feedback, psychoeducation, adherence-based psychotherapy, remote care delivery, secure medication storage, and contingency management. Adherence measurement components include self-reports, remote direct visualization, fully automated computer vision algorithms, biosensors, smart pill bottles, ingestible sensors, pill counts, and utilization measures. Intervention modalities include short messaging service, mobile phone apps, websites, and interactive voice response. We provide graphical representations of intervention component categories and an element-wise breakdown of multicomponent interventions. CONCLUSIONS Many technology-based medication adherence and monitoring interventions have been studied across psychiatric disease contexts. Interventions that are useful in one psychiatric disorder may be useful in other disorders, and further research is necessary to elucidate the specific effects of individual intervention components. Our framework is directly developed from the substance use disorder and mental health treatment literature and allows for transdiagnostic comparisons and an organized conceptual mapping of interventions.","Steinkamp, Jackson M; Goldblatt, Nathaniel; Borodovsky, Jacob T; LaVertu, Amy; Kronish, Ian M; Marsch, Lisa A; Schuman-Olivier, Zev",JMIR mental health,https://doi.org/10.2196/12493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30860493/,614

Traffic police is a high-risk occupation that involves a wide range of tasks and, indirectly, faced with an equally wide variety of hazards at work namely, physical, biological, psychosocial, chemical, and ergonomic hazards. Thereupon, occupational injuries, diseases, and even death are common in the field. The objective of this paper is to collate and explain the major hazards of working as Malaysian traffic police especially in Point Duty Unit, their health effects, and control measures. There are many ways in which these hazards can be minimised by ensuring that sufficient safety measures are taken such as a wireless outdoor individual exposure indicator system for the traffic police. By having this system, air monitoring among traffic police may potentially be easier and accurate.

114844,Expansion of telehealth in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: benefits and barriers.,2021-06-07,"Early excision and autografting are standard care for deeper burns. However, donor sites are a source of significant morbidity. To address this, the ReCell® Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ReCell) was designed for use at the point-of-care to prepare a noncultured, autologous skin cell suspension (ASCS) capable of epidermal regeneration using minimal donor skin. A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of ReCell vs meshed split-thickness skin grafts (STSG, Control) for the treatment of deep partial-thickness burns. Effectiveness measures were assessed to 1 year for both ASCS and Control treatment sites and donor sites, including the incidence of healing, scarring, and pain. At 4 weeks, 98% of the ASCS-treated sites were healed compared with 100% of the Controls. Pain and assessments of scarring at the treatment sites were reported to be similar between groups. Significant differences were observed between ReCell and Control donor sites. The mean ReCell donor area was approximately 40 times smaller than that of the Control (P < .0001), and after 1 week, significantly more ReCell donor sites were healed than Controls (P = .04). Over the first 16 weeks, patients reported significantly less pain at the ReCell donor sites compared with Controls (P ≤ .05 at each time point). Long-term patients reported higher satisfaction with ReCell donor site outcomes compared with the Controls. This study provides evidence that the treatment of deep partial-thickness burns with ASCS results in comparable healing, with significantly reduced donor site size and pain and improved appearance relative to STSG.","Holmes Iv, James Hill; Molnar, Joseph A; Carter, Jeffrey E; Hwang, James; Cairns, Bruce A; King, Booker T; Smith, David J; Cruse, C Wayne; Foster, Kevin N; Peck, Michael D; Sood, Rajiv; Feldman, Michael J; Jordan, Marion H; Mozingo, David W; Greenhalgh, David G; Palmieri, Tina L; Griswold, John A; Dissanaike, Sharmila; Hickerson, William L",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1093/jbcr/iry029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800234/,614

OBJECTIVE We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a proprietary extract of Panax quinquefolius, CVT-E002, in reducing ARI. METHODS This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 293 subjects with early-stage, untreated CLL conducted January-March 2009. RESULTS ARI was common, occurring on about 10% of days during the study period. There were no significant differences of the 2 a priori primary end points: ARI days (8.5 ± 17.2 for CVT-E002 vs 6.8 ± 13.3 for placebo) and severe ARI days (2.9 ± 9.5 for CVT-E002 vs 2.6 ± 9.8 for placebo). However, 51% of CVT-E002 vs 56% of placebo recipients experienced at least 1 ARI (difference, -5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -16% to 7%); more intense ARI occurred in 32% of CVT-E002 vs 39% of placebo recipients (difference, -7%; 95% CI, -18% to 4%), and symptom-specific evaluation showed reduced moderate to severe sore throat (P = .004) and a lower rate of grade ≥3 toxicities (P = .02) in CVT-E002 recipients. Greater seroconversion (4-fold increases in antibody titer) vs 9 common viral pathogens was documented in CVT-E002 recipients (16% vs 7%, P = .04). LIMITATIONS Serologic evaluation of antibody titers was not tied to a specific illness, but covered the entire study period. CONCLUSION CVT-E002 was well tolerated. It did not reduce the number of ARI days or antibiotic use; however, there was a trend toward reduced rates of moderate to severe ARI and significantly less sore throat, suggesting that the increased rate of seroconversion most likely reflects CVT-E002-enhanced antibody responses.","High, Kevin P; Case, Doug; Hurd, David; Powell, Bayard; Lesser, Glenn; Falsey, Ann R; Siegel, Robert; Metzner-Sadurski, Joanna; Krauss, John C; Chinnasami, Bernard; Sanders, George; Rousey, Steven; Shaw, Edward G",The journal of supportive oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.suponc.2011.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22266154/,614

One of the most significant challenges with CP therapy, however, both when defining its efficacy and implementing its approach clinically, is accurately and efficiently characterizing an otherwise heterogenous therapeutic treatment. Given current limitations, our goal is to leverage a SARS antibody testing platform with a newly developed automated endpoint titer analysis program to rapidly define SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in CP donors and hospitalized patients. A newly developed antibody detection platform was used to perform a serial dilution enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgM, and IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Data were then analyzed using commercially available software, GraphPad Prism, or a newly developed program developed in Python called TiterScape, to analyze endpoint titers. Endpoint titer calculations and analysis times were then compared between the two analysis approaches. Serial dilution analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels revealed a high level of heterogeneity between individuals. Commercial platform analysis required significant time for manual data input and extrapolated endpoint titer values when the last serial dilution was above the endpoint cutoff, occasionally producing erroneously high results. By contrast, TiterScape processed 1008 samples for endpoint titer results in roughly 14 minutes compared with the 8 hours required for the commercial software program analysis. Equally important, results generated by TiterScape and Prism were highly similar, with differences averaging 1.26 ± 0.2 percent (mean ± SD). The pandemic has created unprecedented challenges when seeking to accurately test large numbers of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels with a rapid turnaround time.

We consider a special array of sources and detectors that collects intensity (I) and phase (ϕ) data with multiple DS sets. We have recently shown that DSϕ reflectance data features a deeper sensitivity with respect to DSI reflectance data. Here, for the first time, we describe a DS imaging approach based on the Moore-Penrose inverse of the sensitivity matrix for multiple DS data sets. Using a circular 8-source/9-detector array that generates 16 DS data sets at source-detector distances in the range 20-40 mm, we show that DSI images are more sensitive to superficial (<5mm) perturbations, whereas DSϕ images are more sensitive to deeper (>10mm) perturbations in highly scattering media.","Blaney, Giles; Sassaroli, Angelo; Fantini, Sergio",Optics letters,https://doi.org/10.1364/ol.394829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796984/,614

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of passive peritoneal drainage on achieving negative fluid balance and its ability to dispose of inflammatory cytokines. METHODS From September 2014 to November 2016, infants undergoing STAT category 3, 4, and 5 operations were randomized to receive or not receive intraoperative prophylactic peritoneal drain. We analyzed time to negative fluid balance and perioperative variables for each group. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured from serum and peritoneal fluid in the passive peritoneal drainage group and serum in the control group postoperatively. RESULTS Infants were randomized to prophylactic passive peritoneal drain group (n = 13) and control (n = 12). The groups were not significantly different in pre- and postoperative peak lactate levels, postoperative length of stay, and mortality. Peritoneal drain patients reached time to negative fluid balance at a median of 1.42 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.00-2.91), whereas the control at 3.08 (IQR: 1.67-3.88; P = .043). Peritoneal drain patients had lower diuretic index at 72 hours, median of 2.86 (IQR: 1.21-4.94) versus 6.27 (IQR: 4.75-11.11; P = .006). Consistently, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and interferon-γ were present at higher levels in peritoneal fluid than serum at 24 and 72 hours. However, serum cytokine levels in peritoneal drain and control group, at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively, did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS The prophylactic passive peritoneal drain patients reached negative fluid balance earlier and used less diuretic in early postoperative period. The serum cytokine levels did not differ significantly between groups at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively. However, there was no significant difference in mortality and postoperative length of stay.","Pourmoghadam, Kamal K; Kubovec, Stacey; DeCampli, William M; Khallouq, Bertha Ben; Piggott, Kurt; Blanco, Carlos; Fakioglu, Harun; Kube, Alicia; Narasimhulu, Sukumar Suguna",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/2150135119888143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32093557/,614

The objective of this study was to systematically investigate outcomes in MD after cochlear implantation (CoI), with and without labyrinthectomy. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic review of articles in Medline and Embase was performed to identify all studies of patients with MD who underwent CoI. This analysis evaluates outcomes of speech recognition, pure tone audiometry, vertigo, tinnitus, and quality of life. RESULTS Of 321 studies identified, 37 were included, involving 216 patients. Mean age at implantation was 61.4 years (range 27-85 years) with average length of follow-up at 1.7 years (range 0-9 years). Forty-four (20.4%) patients underwent labyrinthectomy. Meta-analysis demonstrated significant improvements in audiometric outcomes following CoI. There was a statistically significant improvement in Hearing in Noise Test performance, with a mean difference improvement of 44.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] [8.8, 80.6]) at 6 months and 60.1 (95% CI [35.3, 85.0]) at 12 months. The Freiburger Monosyllabic Test (FMT) and Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) also improved significantly, with mean difference improvements of 46.2 (95% CI [30.0, 62.4]) for FMT and 19.3 (95% CI [8.1, 30.4]) for CNC. There was a statistically significant decrease in tinnitus, as measured by a mean difference reduction of 48.1 (95% CI [1.0, 95.2]) in the Tinnitus Handicap Index. CONCLUSIONS CoI with and without simultaneous labyrinthectomy is a viable treatment option for patients with MD, yielding high rates of tinnitus suppression and vertigo control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight patients (6 men and 2 women; mean age, 56.6 ± 5.5 years) with 9 ablated HCCs constituted our study population. Three readers interpreted the studies to determine the presence or absence of residual malignancy. Two readers independently assessed the fused MR-PET images to compare registration accuracy of two types of T2-weighted (triggered T2 half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo and turbo spin-echo) and T1-weighted [Cartesian and radial 3D gradient echo (GRE)]. Image quality evaluation of both 3D-GRE T1-weighted sequences was evaluated. Kappa statistics were used to measure inter-observer agreement. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS Definite residual tumor was observed in 3/9 ablations; two were PET positive. All residual tumors were isovascular on MRI. Radial 3D-GRE demonstrated significantly superior MR-PET subjective co-registration in comparison with the remaining sequences and showed a non-significant trend toward higher image quality scores than Cartesian GRE. CONCLUSION Whole-body hybrid MR-PET is feasible as a part of 1-month follow-up post-locoregional thermoablative treatment for HCC. Radial 3D-GRE offers improved co-registration with PET data, with overall good image quality.","Ramalho, Miguel; AlObaidy, Mamdoh; Burke, Lauren M; Dale, Brian M; Gerber, David A; Wong, Terence Z; Semelka, Richard C",Abdominal imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-015-0436-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25906343/,614
117559,A Viewpoint From Paris on the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Necessary Turn to Telepsychiatry.,2020-03-31,": Feral swine ( Sus scrofa) are a pathogen reservoir for pseudorabies virus (PrV). The virus can be fatal to wildlife and contributes to economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. National surveillance efforts in the US use serology to detect PrV-specific antibodies in feral swine populations, but PrV exposure is not a direct indicator of pathogen transmission among conspecifics or to non-suid wildlife species. We measured antibody production and the presence of PrV DNA in four tissue types from feral swine populations of Florida, US. We sampled blood, nasal, oral, and genital swabs from 551 individuals at 39 sites during 2014-16. Of the animals tested for antibody production, 224 of 436 (51%) feral swine were antibody positive while 38 of 549 feral swine (7%) tested for viral shedding were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive for PrV. The detection of PrV DNA across all the collected sample types (blood, nasal, oral, and genital [vaginal] swabs) suggested viral shedding via direct (oronasal or venereal), and potentially indirect (through carcass consumption), routes of transmission among infected and susceptible animals. Fourteen of 212 seronegative feral swine were qPCR-positive, indicating 7% false negatives in the serologic assay. Our findings suggest that serology may underestimate the actual infection risk posed by feral swine to other species and that feral swine populations in Florida are capable of shedding the virus through multiple routes.","Hernández, Felipe A; Sayler, Katherine A; Bounds, Courtney; Milleson, Michael P; Carr, Amanda N; Wisely, Samantha M",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/2017-04-071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28982018/,614

Materials and Methods: Single-center retrospective cohort study including 288 patients who underwent laparoscopic-cholecystectomy at **** from January 2016 to July 2018. Ambulatory LC were compared to well-matched inpatient procedures performed in the same study period. The primary endpoints was the 30-day readmission rate. Secondary endpoints were the discharge rate in the ambulatory group, the post-operative complications rate and cost effectiveness. Results: 120/288 (41.7%) patients underwent ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Thirty-two (26.7%) patients who underwent ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy had major preoperative comorbidities and 35 (29.2%) had undergone prior abdominal surgery. The readmission rates for ambulatory patients and inpatients were 0.8% and 1.7% (p = 0.56), respectively; 104 (86.7%) ambulatory patients were discharged successfully on the same day. The two groups showed the same post-operative complication rate (p = 0.40). Ambulatory procedures resulted in related cost savings of more than 300% for the hospital and a remarkable financial benefit for the National Italian Healthcare System, accounting for savings exceeding € 27 000 per year. Conclusions: Ambulatory laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and cost effective. Since a third of ambulatory patients showed comorbidity or previous abdominal surgery, we believe that this procedure may be performed safely in a tertiary HPB centre, even in complex patients.","Manzia, Tommaso Maria; Quaranta, Claudia; Filingeri, Vincenzino; Toti, Luca; Anselmo, Alessandro; Tariciotti, Laura; De Carolis, Gerardo; Cacciola, Roberto; Di Lorenzo, Nicola; Sorge, Roberto; Angelico, Roberta; Monteleone, Giovanni; Tisone, Giuseppe",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.04.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461804/,614

We assessed contamination during routine sample analysis in automated clinical chemistry and microbiology laboratories. METHODS A fluorescent marker was applied to specimen container exteriors to assess the impact of gross contamination. Nonpathogenic MS2 virus was added to remnant blood, urine, and ESwab matrices as a biomarker of cross-contamination. Samples were processed and analyzed using Roche Cobas 8100 and ISE, c502, e602, and c702 modules (blood) and BD Kiestra total laboratory automation (blood, urine, ESwabs) over 3 experiments. Fluorescence transfer to laboratory surfaces and personnel was visualized using ultraviolet light. Surfaces were swabbed and assessed for MS2 cross-contamination by RT-PCR. Adherence to standard precautions by laboratory staff was assessed by observation. RESULTS Fluorescence was observed on 49 of 165 (30%) laboratory surfaces and personnel and 21 of 93 (23%) total laboratory automation instruments. Fluorescence transferred most frequently to gloves (31/40), computer accessories (9/18), and specimen loading racks (12/12). None of 123 areas swabbed were positive for MS2. Improper personal protective equipment use occurred at a rate of 0.36 and 0.15 events per staff per hour in the chemistry and microbiology laboratories, respectively. Hand-washing compliance was observed for 61 of 132 (46%) staff members evaluated. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of grossly contaminated specimens on automated chemistry and microbiology equipment elicits a low likelihood of instrument contamination. However, handling contaminated specimen containers can result in contamination of environmental laboratory surfaces, representing a source of risk that is heightened by low adherence to appropriate personal protective equipment.","Farnsworth, Christopher W; Wallace, Meghan A; Liu, Albert; Gronowski, Ann M; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Yarbrough, Melanie L",Clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870987/,614

There is particular controversy over the importance of aerosol transmission and whether airborne precautions should be recommended for some respiratory viruses. Here, we review the current recommendations of transmission-based precautions and the latest evidence on the aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses. RECENT FINDINGS Viral nucleic acids, and in some instances viable viruses, have been detected in aerosols in the air in healthcare settings for some respiratory viruses such as seasonal and avian influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. However, current evidences are yet to demonstrate that these viruses can effectively spread via airborne route between individuals, or whether preventive measures in airborne precautions would be effective. SUMMARY Studies that use transmission events as outcome to demonstrate human-to-human transmission over the aerosol route or quantitative measurement of infectious respiratory viruses in the air are needed to evaluate the infectiousness of respiratory viruses over the aerosol route. When a respiratory virus in concern only leads to disease with low severity, airborne precautions are not likely to be justified.","Shiu, Eunice Y C; Leung, Nancy H L; Cowling, Benjamin J",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135389/,614

Earlier reports have suggested that COVID-19 agents can be present in the sewage samples and thus it can be a good indication of the pandemic extent in a community. However, no such studies have been reported in the Indian context. Hence, it becomes absolutely necessary to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 in the wastewater samples from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serving different localities of Jaipur city. Samples from different WWTPs and hospital wastewater samples were collected and wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) studies were carried out using the RT-PCR to confirm the presence of different COVID-19 target genes namely S gene, E gene, ORF1ab gene, RdRp gene and N gene. The results revealed that the untreated wastewater samples showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, which was correlated with the increased number of COVID-19 positive patients from the concerned areas, as reported in the publically available health data. This is the first study that investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in wastewater, at higher ambient temperature (45 °C), further validating WBE as potential tool in predicting and mitigating outbreaks.","Arora, Sudipti; Nag, Aditi; Sethi, Jasmine; Rajvanshi, Jayana; Saxena, Sonika; Shrivastava, Sandeep K; Gupta, A B",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33341773/,614

To assist decision making, there is a need to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative programs within home care. Electronic searches were performed in five databases (before February 2020) identifying 3292 potentially relevant studies that assessed new or enhanced home care interventions compared with usual care for adults with an accompanying economic evaluation. From these, 133 articles were selected for full-text screening; 17 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Six main areas of research were identified including the following: alternative nursing care (n = 4), interdisciplinary care coordination (n = 4), fall prevention (n = 4), telemedicine/remote monitoring (n = 2), restorative/reablement care (n = 2), and one multifactorial undernutrition intervention study. Risk of bias was found to be high/weak (n = 7) or have some concerns/moderate (n = 6) rating, in addition to inconsistent reporting of important information required for economic evaluations. Both health and cost outcomes had mixed results. Cost-effective interventions were found in two areas including alternative nursing care and reablement/restorative care. Clinicians and decision makers are encouraged to carefully evaluate the quality of the studies because of issues with risk of bias and incomplete reporting of economic outcomes.","Flemming, Julie; Armijo-Olivo, Susan; Dennett, Liz; Lapointe, Paul; Robertson, David; Wang, Jian; Ohinmaa, Arto",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415887/,614

METHODS As a part of an ongoing prospective study to identify the etiology of viral respiratory infections in Spain, we performed the analysis of HCoV infections in children hospitalized in a secondary hospital in Madrid, between October 2005 and June 2018. Clinical data of HCoV patients were compared with those infected by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. RESULTS The study population consisted of 5131 hospitalizations for respiratory causes in children. A total of 3901 cases (75.9%) had a positive viral identification and 205 cases (4.1%) were positive for HCoV. Only 41 cases (20%) of HCoV infection were detected as single infections. Episodes of recurrent wheezing were the most common diagnosis, and 112 children (54%) had hypoxia. Clinical data in HCoV cases were similar to those associated with rhinovirus; however, patients with HCoV were younger. Other viruses were associated with hypoxia more frequently than cases with HCoV; high fever was more common in influenza infections and bronchiolitis in respiratory syncytial virus group. Although a slight peak of circulation appears mostly in winter, HCoV has been detected throughout the year as well. CONCLUSIONS HCoV infections represent a small fraction of respiratory infections that require hospitalization in children and their characteristics do not differ greatly from other respiratory viral infections.","Calvo, Cristina; Alcolea, Sonia; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Iglesias, María; Gonzalez-Esguevillas, Mónica; Luz García-García, María",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32453196/,614

These relationship networks can create value and resources for organizations and individuals. This current study aimed to explore the potential impact of workplace social capital on the association between perceived stress and professional identity in clinical nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, 308 Chinese clinical nurses filled out the Chinese Workplace Social Capital Scale, the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, and the Chinese Nurse's Professional Identity Scale. Descriptive analysis, independent samples t test, analysis of variance, Pearson correlation analyses, and bootstrap method were performed to analyze the data. RESULTS Perceived stress was negatively correlated with professional identity (r = -0.455, p < .001). Workplace social capital was not found to moderate the relationship between perceived stress and professional identity (95% CI -0.03 to- 0.06, p = .47 > .05). Instead, it mediated that relationship (95% CI -0.61 to -0.19, p < .05), and its mediating effect was -0.37. CONCLUSIONS In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, workplace social capital among the investigated clinical nurses failed to buffer the negative impact of perceived stress on professional identity, but it did play a part in mediating perceived stress and professional identity. A healthy workplace should be provided to clinical nurses to improve their professional identity, while lowering perceived stress.","Zhang, Yu-Dong; Gao, Ya-Qin; Tang, Yan; Li, Yu-Hong",Japan journal of nursing science : JJNS,https://doi.org/10.1111/jjns.12376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32896954/,614

The COVID-19 pandemic has made such examination formats impossible, and medical educators have explored the use of online assessments as a potential replacement. This shift has in turn led to fears that the change in format or academic malpractice might lead to considerably higher attainment scores on online assessment with no underlying improvement in student competence. METHOD Here, we present an analysis of 8092 sittings of the Prescribing Safety Assessment (PSA), an assessment designed to test the prescribing skills of final year medical students in the UK. In-person assessments for the PSA were cancelled partway through the academic year 2020, with 6048 sittings delivered in an offline, traditionally invigilated format, and then 2044 sittings delivered in an online, webcam invigilated format. RESULTS A comparison (able to detect very small effects) showed no attainment gap between online (M = 0.762, SD = 0.34) and offline (M = 0.761, SD = 0.34) performance.

129897,Return to play after the COVID-19 pandemic: a commentary by the Editor in Chief.,2020-05-01,"Ribosomal frameshifting entails slippage of the translational machinery during elongation. Frameshifting permits expression of more than one polypeptide from an otherwise monocistronic mRNA, and can restore expression of polypeptides in the face of frameshift mutations. A common mutation conferring acyclovir resistance in patients with herpes simplex virus disease deletes one cytosine from a run of six cytosines (C-chord) in the viral thymidine kinase (tk) gene. However, this mutation does not abolish TK activity, which is important for pathogenicity. To investigate how this mutant retains TK activity, we engineered and analyzed viruses expressing epitope-tagged TK. We found that the mutant's TK activity can be accounted for by low levels of full-length TK polypeptide produced by net -1 frameshifting during translation. The efficiency of frameshifting was relatively high, 3-5%, as the polypeptide from the reading frame generated by the deletion, which lacks stop codons (nonstop), was poorly expressed mainly because of inefficient protein synthesis. Stop codons introduced into this reading frame greatly increased its expression, but greatly decreased the level of full-length TK, indicating that frameshifting is strongly stimulated by a new mechanism, nonstop mRNA, which we hypothesize involves stalling of ribosomes on the polyA tail. Mutational studies indicated that frameshifting occurs on or near the C-chord, a region lacking a canonical slippery sequence. Nonstop stimulation of frameshifting also occurred when the C-chord was replaced with a canonical slippery sequence from HIV. This mechanism thus permits biologically and clinically relevant TK synthesis, and may occur more generally.","Pan, Dongli; Coen, Donald M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1206582109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22927407/,614

MATERIALS AND METHODS Within 16 months, 76 consecutive patients (mean age 70.7 year; range 33-89) underwent stent-assisted mechanical thrombectomy. Of 52 enrolled patients (68.4 %) with occlusion of the anterior circulation, 22 patients (42.3 %) underwent DAT; 30 patients (57.7 %) were treated in conventional monoaspiration technique (MAT). Epidemiological data, clinical and imaging characteristics (mRS, NIHSS, ASPECTS) as well as procedural details were analyzed (TICI, number of retrieval, procedure time). Clinical outcome was determined with mRS at discharge and after 90 days. RESULTS In the context of DAT additional carotid artery stenting was required in 45.5 % (10/22) in underlying tandem lesion (vs. 0/30 MAT). No differences were found in NIHSS at admission (MAT: 20.5, range 15-29; DAT: 18.6; range 11-25), mRS at admission (MAT: 4.6 vs. DAT: 4.57) or ASPECT score (MAT: 8.3, ±1.5; DAT: 8.4, ±1.5; P > 0.05). TICI ≥ 2b/3 was conducted in 90 % (MAT) and 100 % (DAT), respectively. The procedure time was longer in the MAT group (65 min, ±25.9, range 18-126) compared to the DAT group (49.7 min, ±15, range 32-101; P = 0.016). The clinical outcome increased from admission to discharge and in follow-up after 90 days (mRS ≥ 2: MAT: 53.3 %, DAT: 54.5 %; P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The dual aspiration technique with an additional intermediate guide catheter placed closed to the stent retriever leads to decreased procedure time in the anterior circulation.

130665,Impact of Treatment With TNF-α Inhibitors for Hidradenitis Suppurativa During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-02-24,BACKGROUND Acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG) caused by vitreous hemorrhage is a rare complication of intravitreal injection that often leads to permanent vision loss without prompt treatment. CASE REPORT This is a case of vitreous hemorrhage with secondary AACG in an 80-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) with pain and vision loss in his left eye after undergoing intravitreal injection to treat exudative macular degeneration. The diagnosis was made with the use of point-of-care ultrasound after intraocular pressure (IOP) was found to be significantly elevated in the left eye. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should have a high level of suspicion for AACG in patients who are diagnosed with a vitreous hemorrhage after intravitreal injection and should immediately measure IOP for elevation upon presentation to the ED.,"Jersey, Andrew; Perice, Leland; Li, Nicole; Johnson, Jennifer; Dulani, Tina",The Journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.08.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004244/,614
130811,Identifying and addressing psychosocial determinants of adherence to physical distancing guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic - project protocol.,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Poor communication is a barrier to care for people with hearing loss. We assessed the feasibility and potential benefit of providing a simple hearing assistance device during an emergency department (ED) visit, for people who reported difficulty hearing. DESIGN Randomized controlled pilot study. SETTING The ED of New York Harbor Manhattan Veterans Administration Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS One hundred and thirty-three Veterans aged 60 and older, presenting to the ED, likely to be discharged to home, who either (1) said that they had difficulty hearing, or (2) scored 10 or greater (range 0-40) on the Hearing Handicap Inventory-Survey (HHI-S). INTERVENTION Subjects were randomized (1:1), and intervention subjects received a personal amplifier (PA; Williams Sound Pocketalker 2.0) for use during their ED visit. MEASUREMENTS Three survey instruments: (1) six-item Hearing and Understanding Questionnaire (HUQ); (2) three-item Care Transitions Measure; and (3) three-item Patient Understanding of Discharge Information. Post-ED visit phone calls to assess ED returns. RESULTS Of the 133 subjects, 98.3% were male; mean age was 76.4 years (standard deviation (SD) = 9.2). Mean HHI-S score was 19.2 (SD = 8.3). Across all HUQ items, intervention subjects reported better in-ED experience than controls. Seventy-five percent of intervention subjects agreed or strongly agreed that ability to understand what was said was without effort versus 56% for controls. Seventy-five percent of intervention subjects versus 36% of controls said clinicians provided them with an explanation about presenting problems. Three percent of intervention subjects had an ED revisit within 3 days compared with 9.0% controls. CONCLUSION Veterans with hearing difficulties reported improved in-ED experiences with use of PAs, and were less likely to return to the ED within 3 days. PAs may be an important adjunct to older patient ED care but require validation in a larger more definitive randomized controlled trial.","Chodosh, Joshua; Goldfeld, Keith; Weinstein, Barbara E; Radcliffe, Kate; Burlingame, Madeleine; Dickson, Victoria; Grudzen, Corita; Sherman, Scott; Smilowitz, Jessica; Blustein, Jan",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33576037/,614

We report a rare case of intraventricular and subdural tension pneumocephalus occurring 2 months after repeat right-sided microvascular decompression (MVD) for recurrent trigeminal neuralgia. Case Description The patient in this case was a 79-year-old woman who presented with acute-onset confusion, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. On computed tomography, substantial volumes of pneumocephalus in the fourth ventricle and subdural space at the site of the retrosigmoid exposure for the previous MVD were seen. She underwent emergent wound exploration, and no obvious dural defect or exposed mastoid air cells were identified. The dura was reopened, and the surgical site was copiously irrigated. Mastoid air cells were covered with ample amounts of bone wax, and the wound was closed. The patient recovered well postoperatively with complete resolution of the pneumocephalus by her 3-month follow-up evaluation. Conclusion It is important to assess for cerebrospinal fluid leakage and that air cells are sealed off before wound closure to prevent a pathway for air to egress into the surgical cavity and corridor.","Lim, Jaims; Nyabuto, Elizabeth; Vakharia, Kunal; Levy, Elad I",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.25259/sni_917_2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34345452/,614

133679,Virtual Care Takes Off During COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Myocardial fibrosis is an important pathological feature of pressure overload cardiac remodeling. Si-Miao-Yong-An decoction (SMYAD), a traditional Chinese formula, is now clinically used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. However, its mechanisms in the prevention of heart failure are not fully revealed. PURPOSE To determine whether treatment with SMYAD for 4 weeks would lead to changes in collagen metabolism and ventricular remodeling in a mice model of heart failure. METHODS Mice were subjected to transverse aorta constriction to generate pressure overload induced cardiac remodeling and then were administered SMYAD (14.85 g/kg/day) or captopril (16.5 mg/kg/day) intragastrically for 4 weeks after surgery. Echocardiography and immunohistochemical examination were used to evaluate the effects of SMYAD. The mRNA of collagen metabolism biomarkers were detected. Protein expression of TGF-β1/Smad and TGF-β1/TAK1/p38 pathway were assessed by Western blot. RESULTS SMYAD significantly improved cardiac function, increased left ventricle ejection fraction, and decreased fibrosis area and αSMA expression. Moreover, SMYAD reduced proteins expression related to collagen metabolism, including Col1, Col3, TIMP2 and CTGF. The increased levels of TGF-β1, Smad2, and Smad3 phosphorylation were attenuated in SMYAD group. In addition, SMYAD reduced the levels of TGF-β1, p-TAK1 and p-p38 compared with TAC group. CONCLUSIONS SMYAD improved cardiac fibrosis and heart failure by inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad and TGF-β1/TAK1/p38 pathway. SMYAD protected against cardiac fibrosis and maintained collagen metabolism balance by regulating MMP-TIMP expression. Taken together, these results indicate that SMYAD might be a promising therapeutic agent against cardiac fibrosis.","Su, Congping; Wang, Qing; Luo, Hui; Jiao, Wenchao; Tang, Jiayang; Li, Lin; Tian, Lei; Chen, Xiangyang; Liu, Bin; Yu, Xue; Li, Sen; Guo, Shuzhen; Wang, Wei",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403042/,614

137207,Risks to Bangladeshi children and young people during covid-19 outbreak.,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), a method of inducing thermal ablation (cell death), is often used to destroy tumours or potentially cancerous tissue. Current techniques for RFA estimation (electrical impedance tomography, Nakagami ultrasound, etc.) require long compute times (≥ 2 s) and measurement devices other than the RFA device. This study aims to determine if a neural network (NN) can estimate ablation lesion depth for control of bipolar RFA using complex electrical impedance - since tissue electrical conductivity varies as a function of tissue temperature - in real time using only the RFA therapy device's electrodes. METHODS Three-dimensional, cubic models comprised of beef liver, pork loin or pork belly represented target tissue. Temperature and complex electrical impedance from 72 data generation ablations in pork loin and belly were used for training the NN (403 s on Xeon processor). NN inputs were inquiry depth, starting complex impedance and current complex impedance. Training-validation-test splits were 70%-0%-30% and 80%-10%-10% (overfit test). Once the NN-estimated lesion depth for a margin reached the target lesion depth, RFA was stopped for that margin of tissue. RESULTS The NN trained to 93% accuracy and an NN-integrated control ablated tissue to within 1.0 mm of the target lesion depth on average. Full 15-mm depth maps were calculated in 0.2 s on a single-core ARMv7 processor. CONCLUSIONS The results show that a NN could make lesion depth estimations in real-time using less in situ devices than current techniques. With the NN-based technique, physicians could deliver quicker and more precise ablation therapy.","Wang, Yearnchee Curtis; Chan, Terence Chee-Hung; Sahakian, Alan Varteres","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2017.1416495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29301446/,614

We herein examined the hemostatic properties and potential for inducing histological lung injury of the LigaSure system in non-anatomic pulmonary resection to estimate the feasibility of its clinical application. METHODS Non-anatomic pulmonary wedge resections of the right cranial, middle, and caudal lobes were performed in four pigs using the LigaSure system (Group A) or electrocautery (Group B). In each resection, the resection time, blood loss, and weight of the resected lung were measured. The thermal effect on the lung tissue was examined by means of intraoperative thermography and histology. RESULTS A total of 12 lung wedge resections were performed in each group. For an equivalent length of operation and weight of the resected lung parenchyma, Group A showed significantly lower blood loss and lower maximum and minimum temperatures of the lung tissue, as assessed by thermography, than Group B. The degree of thermal injury as estimated by a histological examination was lower in Group A than in Group B. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the LigaSure system may be superior to conventional electrocautery, indicating its clinical usefulness for non-anatomic pulmonary resection.","Sugimoto, Seiichiro; Toyooka, Shinichi; Iga, Norichika; Furukawa, Masashi; Sugimoto, Ryujiro; Shien, Kazuhiko; Nishikawa, Hitoshi; Soh, Junichi; Yamane, Masaomi; Oto, Takahiro; Miyoshi, Shinichiro",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-013-0545-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23494066/,614

Our goal was to synthesize peer-reviewed literature and association guidelines from around the world regarding dysphagia assessment and management for this specific population. Method A review of publications available in the PubMed database and official guidelines of international groups was performed on May 23, 2020. The information was synthesized and categorized into three content areas for swallowing: clinical evaluation, instrumental assessment, and rehabilitation. Results Five publications were identified in the PubMed database. Following title, abstract, and full-text review, only three publications met inclusion criteria: two reviews and one narrative report. Additionally, 19 international guidelines were reviewed. To assess swallowing, a modified clinical evaluation was recommended and only following a risk assessment. Instrumental assessments were often considered aerosol generating, especially transnasal procedures such as endoscopy and manometry. For this reason, many associations recommended that these examinations be performed only when essential and with appropriate personal protective equipment. Guidelines recommended that intervention should focus on compensatory strategies, including bolus modification, maneuvers/postural changes, and therapeutic exercises that can be conducted with physical distancing. Respiratory training devices were not recommended during rehabilitation. Conclusions International associations have provided extensive guidance regarding the level of risk related to the management of dysphagia in this population.

The GHS report (2019) spelt out very objectively that none of the countries of the world was prepared to effectively handle such emergencies, should they arise. Observations emerging from different countries highlight these findings although some of them seem to be discordant. Overall, it appears that Asian countries could fight the battle better than most developed nations in the Europe and America during the current pandemic, despite having poor GHS scores.

Chronic Care Management (CCM) and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) are benefits available to Medicare fee-for-service patients, which allow a medical practice to deliver expanded care and generate much-needed revenue. These services can be delivered by clinical staff called care managers. A top health priority for most seniors is to effectively self-isolate to reduce risk of COVID-19, while maintaining mental and physical health.

In response, China has taken a proactive step by issuing a legal decision to ban consumption of terrestrial wildlife. However, concerns have been raised and opponents of bans argue that well-regulated trade should be promoted instead. By analyzing China's legal framework and management system regulating wildlife trade, together with state and provincial-level wildlife-trade licenses and wildlife criminal cases, we argue that current wildlife trade regulations do not function as expected. This is due to outdated protected species lists, insufficient cross-sector collaboration, and weak restrictions and law enforcement on farming and trading of species. The lack of quarantine standards for wildlife and increased wildlife farming in recent years pose great risks for food safety and public health. In addition, wildlife consumption is neither required for subsistence nor an essential part of Chinese diets. All these facts make the ban necessary to provoke improvement in wildlife management, such as updating protected species lists, revising laws and changing consumption behaviors. Nonetheless, the ban is not sufficient to address all the problems. To sustain the efficacy of the change, we propose that a long-term mechanism to reduce the demand and improve effective management is needed.","Xiao, Lingyun; Lu, Zhi; Li, Xueyang; Zhao, Xiang; Li, Binbin V",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.12.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33621498/,614

During a pandemic, the researches aimed at finding the new treatments for SARS-CoV-2 become relevant. The review focuses on studies of androgens and antiandrogens in this disease. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, it has been noted that men have more severe forms of infection and higher mortality. The main cause of both the severity of the disease and the high mortality of men from COVID-19 are associated with androgens. It was found that patients receiving androgen deprivation are less likely to become infected and easily tolerate COVID-19. The researchers explain the effect of the therapy by the effect on the TMPRSS2 protein. It was found that both TMPRSS2 expression and a more severe course of coronavirus infection are observed in men with hyperandrogenism - androgenic alopecia, acne, excessive facial hair growth and increased skin oiliness. In this regard, some researchers suggest to use androgen deprivation for men at high risk of developing COVID-19. Steroid and non-steroidal antiandrogens are used for androgen deprivation. At the same time, obtaned scientific data on the relationship of severe forms and mortality of COVID-19 with low testosterone levels leads to a hypothesis about the possibility of a positive effect not of androgen devrivation therapy but of androgen replacement therapy in case of hypogonadism have diagnosed. These studies have not been completed recently, and data on the effectiveness and safety of antiandrogens and androgens in the treatment of a new coronavirus infection require clarification.","Rozhivanov, Roman V; Andreeva, Elena N; Melnichenko, Galina A; Mokrysheva, Natalya G",Problemy endokrinologii,https://doi.org/10.14341/probl12500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351362/,614

The self-referencing O2-specific micro-optrode (also termed micro-optode and optical fiber microsensor) is a tapered optical fiber with an O2-sensitive fluorophore coated onto the tip. The O2 concentration is quantified by fluorescence quenching of the fluorophore emission upon excitation with blue-green light. The micro-optrode presents high spatial and temporal resolutions with improved signal-to-noise ratio (in the picomole range). In this protocol, we provide step-by-step instructions for micro-optrode calibration, validation, example applications and data analysis.

METHODS A retrospective analysis of firearm injury medical claims among paediatric (<21 years) Medicaid beneficiaries in Ohio from 2010 to 2018. Factors associated with unintentional and intentional firearm injury were explored using multivariable logistic regression. Average annual patient healthcare costs were determined in 2019 US$. RESULTS There were 1061 firearm injury-related claims (853 (80%) unintentional; 154 (15%) intentional; 54 (5%) unknown) occurring in 663 children over 2 736 517 available person-years. From 2010 to 2018, yearly total firearm claims rose from 19.7 to 31.3 per 100 000 persons (p=0.033). Urban children experienced a non-significant increase in firearm claims rate over time (26.1 vs 35.0/100 000; p=0.066) while the claims rate nearly tripled among those in rural areas (8.4 vs 24.0/100 000; p=0.012). Younger age, females and rural residence were associated with reduced odds of injury claims. The average annual costs for emergency department and inpatient visits, respectively, were $260 and $5735. CONCLUSION Risk and type of firearm injury claims among low-income children in Ohio varies by age, sex and residence.

We measured the association of FI change with 4-year mortality using Cox regression. RESULTS From 2011 to 2012, mean FI increased by 0.02 (standard deviation 0.07), with 58.6% having an increase. Over 4 years, 1,039 participants (13.6%) died. After adjusting for age and sex, compared to stable frailty (±0.015), both absolute (>0.045) and proportional (>20%) increases in frailty were associated with higher mortality among pre-frail participants (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (1.45-3.79) and HR (95% CI) = 3.32 (1.76-6.26), respectively), participants with mild frailty (HR (95% CI) = 1.96 (1.35-2.85) and 2.03 (1.37-3.02)) and moderate or severe frailty (HR (95% CI) = 1.99 (1.48-2.67) and 1.94 (1.43-2.63)) but not robust participants (HR (95% CI)= 1.48 (0.86-2.54), HR (95% CI) = 1.62 (0.80-3.28)). However, decreases in FI were not significantly associated with decreased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS Increasing deficit accumulation FI over 1 year is associated with increased mortality risk. While decreasing FI occurs, we did not find evidence to support reduced mortality risk.","Shi, Sandra M; Olivieri-Mui, Brianne; McCarthy, Ellen P; Kim, Dae H",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377190/,614

141577,Keep Calm and Log On: Telemedicine for COVID-19 Pandemic Response.,2020-05-01,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are rare and very aggressive neoplasms with dismal prognosis, especially when metastatic or with negative prognostic factors, such as vascular invasion. To the best of our knowledge, no case of pancreatic NEC with mismatch repair deficiency has been reported to date. We describe a 62-year-old patient who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for a NEC located in the pancreatic head, with peripancreatic lymph node metastases. Tumor necrosis was prominent and the Ki67 proliferative index was 60%. One year after the diagnosis, the patient experienced recurrence with a left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, which was surgically removed, followed by standard cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy. Neoplastic cells showed combined loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in both primary tumor and lymph node metastasis. Microsatellite instability (MSI) test using a mononucleotide repeats pentaplex PCR (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-22, and NR-24) revealed minimal mononucleotide shifts showing deletion of less than 3 bp at NR-21, BAT-26, NR-24, and NR-22 loci. MLH1 methylation analysis revealed absence of the gene promoter methylation. BRAF and KRAS mutations were not detected. In gut, NECs' mismatch repair deficiency phenotype has been reported in about 10% of cases, and it represents an independent factor of more favorable outcome. Likewise, our patient is currently alive with a follow-up of more than 12 years after pancreaticoduodenectomy, by itself an unexpected finding for such an aggressive neoplasm.","Vanoli, Alessandro; Perfetti, Vittorio; Furlan, Daniela; Neri, Giuseppe; Viglio, Alessandra; Sessa, Fausto; Martino, Michele; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Solcia, Enrico; La Rosa, Stefano",Endocrine pathology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12022-020-09622-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388775/,614

Although there is a growing body of theoretical and empirical literature documenting the rise of populism, there has been very little exploration of the implications for health policy of this important political development. In this article, we draw from three illustrative international cases, originating from the USA, the UK and Italy, to explore the ways in which right-wing populism influences health policy: the election of President Trump in the United States (and subsequent healthcare reforms), the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit), and how this has played out in the context of the UK National Health Service, and the rise of a politically aligned anti-vaccination movement in Italy. Drawing on the work of the influential socio-political theorist Ernesto Laclau, we interpret populism as a performative political act, predicated on drawing logics of equivalence (and difference) between different actors. We use this theoretical framing to explore the ways in which the recent upsurge in right-wing populism creates a specific set of barriers and challenges for access to healthcare and the health of populations.","Speed, Ewen; Mannion, Russell",Sociology of health & illness,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32780437/,614

Few comparative studies for SILC and multiport laparoscopic colectomy (MLC) have been conducted. The aim of this case-controlled study was to compare the short-term surgical outcomes between SILC and MLC for right-sided colectomies. METHODS Between January 2010 and February 2012, data from the first 50 consecutive patients that underwent right SILS at one of the two institutions were compared with a group of 50 consecutive patients that underwent right MLC in the same period. RESULTS Median operative time was significantly shorter in SILC (97 vs. 112 min; p < 0.001). Between both groups, no statistically significant differences were found regarding number and nature of short-term complications, number of reoperations [4 (8%) vs. 6 (12%)], and mortality rate [1 (2%) vs. 2 (4%)]. Median postoperative hospital stay was 6 days for both groups. CONCLUSION SILC is a safe and feasible procedure when performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Length of hospital stay and overall complication rates are comparable with MLC. Until today, no clear advantages of SILC over MLC have been demonstrated. However, due to its smaller incisional trauma, SILC could be a major step in improving cosmetic outcomes.","Velthuis, Simone; van den Boezem, Peter B; Lips, Daan J; Prins, Hubert A; Cuesta, Miguel A; Sietses, Colin",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000346044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23364285/,614

Incidence of VTE has been reported before and results varied widely in study cohorts. AREA OF UNCERTAINTY Incidence of major VTE (segmental pulmonary embolism and above and proximal deep vein thrombosis) which is a contributor to mortality and morbidity is not known. Also, data is unclear on the optimal anticoagulation regimen to prevent VTE. DATA SOURCES Multiple databases including PubMed were searched until May 12, 2020, to include studies reporting VTE in hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients. MOOSE guidelines were followed in selection, and 11 studies were included. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the VTE burden in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and potential benefits of therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation compared with prophylaxis dosing for VTE prevention. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Many societies and experts recommend routine prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin for VTE prevention in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this meta-analysis, the pooled rate of major VTE was 12.5% in hospitalized patients and 17.2% in intensive care unit patients. When therapeutic anticoagulation dosing was compared with prophylactic anticoagulation, the pooled odds ratio of VTE was 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.75; P = 0.008, I = 0%) suggesting statistical significance with therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation for primary prevention of VTE in all hospitalized patients. However, this should be interpreted with caution as the bleeding events and safety profile could not be ascertained because of lack of adequate information. We recommend applying this finding to hospitalized COVID 19 patients only after carefully weighing individual bleeding risks and benefits. CONCLUSION Major VTE events, especially pulmonary embolism, seem to be high in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Therapeutic anticoagulation dosing seems to significantly benefit the odds of preventing any VTE when compared with prophylactic dosing in all hospitalized patients.","Sridharan, Gurusaravanan Kutti; Vegunta, Radhakrishna; Rokkam, Venkata Ram Pradeep; Meyyur Aravamudan, Veeraraghavan; Vegunta, Rathnamitreyee; Khan, Shahab R; Ponnada, Suresh; Boregowda, Umesha; Prudhvi, Kalyan; Chamarthi, Gajapathiraju; Mohan, Babu P",American journal of therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mjt.0000000000001295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156016/,614

The aim of this review is to assess large, randomized, and controlled trials on BP targets, as well as review selected observational analyses from other large randomized BP trials in order to evaluate the benefit of intense vs. standard BP control. None of the studies, except SPRINT, favored intense BP treatment. Some of the studies suggested favorable effects of lowering treatment target in patients with diabetes or high risk of stroke. In SPRINT, a new BP measurement method was introduced, and the results must be interpreted in light of this. The results of the observational analyses indicated the best preventive effect when achieving early and sustained BP control rather than low targets. In conclusion, today's guidelines' recommended treatment target of <140/90mmHg seems sufficient for most patients. Early and sustained BP control should be the main focus.","Mariampillai, Julian E; Eskås, Per Anders; Heimark, Sondre; Kjeldsen, Sverre E; Narkiewicz, Krzysztof; Mancia, Giuseppe",Progress in cardiovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2016.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619341/,614

Therefore, a specific newer generation MWA system, The Emprint™ Ablation System with Thermosphere™ Technology, was designed to create predictable large spherical zones of ablation that are not impacted by varying tissue environments. The time required for ablation with MWA systems is short, and the shape of the necrosis is elliptical with the older systems and spherical with the new system. In addition, because MWA has no heat-sink effect, it can be used to ablate tumors adjacent to major vessels. Although these factors yield a large ablation volume and result in good local control, excessive ablation of liver tissue and unexpected ablation of surrounding organs are possible. Therefore, MWA should be carefully performed. This review highlights the efficacy and complications of MWA performed with conventional systems and the newer generation system in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MWA with the newer generation system seems to be a promising treatment option for large HCCs and secondary hepatic malignancies, with several advantages over other available ablation techniques, including conventional MWA. However, further randomized controlled trials are necessary to fully clarify the benefits and pitfalls of this new system.","Imajo, Kento; Ogawa, Yuji; Yoneda, Masato; Saito, Satoru; Nakajima, Atsushi",Journal of medical ultrasonics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10396-019-00997-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31960190/,614

Our aim was to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and the outcome of OHCA victims not treated by targeted temperature management. METHODS This was a prospective observational study of OHCA patients. The patients were categorized according to BMI into two groups: the normal BMI group (nBMI) and the elevated BMI group (eBMI). The primary endpoint was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), while secondary outcomes were survival to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and survival to ICU discharge. RESULTS Of the initial 99 patients who were transported to the Emergency Department, 84 (85%) were included in the study. Mean BMI was 29.8kg/m2. Thirteen (15.5%) patients achieved ROSC and were admitted to the ICU, with the mean duration of ICU length of stay being 6.7±4.9days. Survival to ICU admission and ICU discharge were higher in the eBMI group (17.6% vs. 6.25%, p=0.010 and 10.3% vs. 6.25%, p=0.021, respectively). Survival to ICU discharge was higher in ventricular fibrillation patients compared to patients with non-shockable rhythms, irrespectively of their BMI (p=0.002).

Few studies have assessed the knowledge and perceptions of asthma among adolescents. OBJECTIVES This study assessed the knowledge and perception about asthma among secondary school students in an all-girls school in Nigeria. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in a Nigerian secondary school in Enugu State (February 2020). In Senior Secondary School (SS1, SS2, SS3), students could be in one of three specialized classes: Sciences, Humanities, Business. A self-administered structured questionnaire was filled by conveniently sampled students in SS1 and SS2. Inferential statistics utilized the Pearson's Chi-Square test and multiple linear regression with statistical significance set as P < 0.05. RESULTS Three hundred and eighty-eight (388) students participated in the study (mean age = 14.64 ± 0.93 years). Majority of the students were in Science class (n = 299; 77.1%). There was high awareness about asthma (n = 384; 99.0%). More than half of them had good asthma knowledge (n = 279; 71.9%); close to three-fifths had favourable perception of asthma (n = 222; 57.2%).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate a totally metal-free technique using a transosseous suturing method and to compare it with the traditional fixation technique. METHOD A total of 25 patients (mean age of 59.60 years) with displaced patellar fractures treated by a transosseous suturing technique were compared with a 1:1 matched historical control group that underwent modified tension-band-wire fixation. Union time, union rate, operation time, number of procedures, mean hospitalisation days and complications were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS Union time (8.43 ± 2.92 vs. 8.64 ± 2.82 weeks) and operation time (69.00 ± 19.31 vs. 64.89 ± 14.27 min) were not different between the two groups. Mean hospitalisation days (4.04 ± 1.40 vs. 5.76 ± 1.50 days; P<0.001), number of procedures and the frequency of complications were significantly lower in the transosseous suturing group.

We identified airway epithelial cell types and states vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In patients with COVID-19, epithelial cells showed an average three-fold increase in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, which correlated with interferon signals by immune cells. Compared to moderate cases, critical cases exhibited stronger interactions between epithelial and immune cells, as indicated by ligand-receptor expression profiles, and activated immune cells, including inflammatory macrophages expressing CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF. The transcriptional differences in critical cases compared to moderate cases likely contribute to clinical observations of heightened inflammatory tissue damage, lung injury and respiratory failure.

In this single-centre study, we evaluated the laparoscopic approach of excision of the urachus leaving the umbilicus untouched. METHODS Twenty-one patients were operated on for persisting symptomatic urachal anomalies between 1998 and 2011. Patients included 8 males and 13 females (mean 28.5 years, range 15-72 years). Patients' histories, surgical data and demographic data were prospectively collected and analysed. During follow-up, patients were evaluated using the total body image and cosmesis questionnaire (BIQ). RESULTS Excision of the urachus was carried out in 18 cases in a laparoscopic three-trocar technique and in 3 cases using single-site surgery. In all cases, the infected umbilicus was left untouched. Mean surgical time of all procedures was 55.7 min (31-106 min). Histopathology confirmed an urachal anomaly in all cases. The former discharging or infected umbilicus healed without any complications. Sixteen patients could be included for the BIQ. Total body image score after surgery was 5.49 with a score of 5.0 being the most satisfactory result possible. The total cosmetic score was 21.37 close to the maximum score of 24. CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic treatment of urachal anomalies using a three-trocar technique or the single-site surgery technique is both safe and effective. In our opinion, the excision of the umbilicus should be avoided. It simplifies the procedure and leads to satisfactory cosmetic results.","Patrzyk, Maciej; Wilhelm, Lutz; Ludwig, Kaja; Heidecke, Claus Dieter; von Bernstorff, Wolfram",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-013-1039-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23408208/,614

148066,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,2020-04-29,"UNLABELLED One role of mRNA cap guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) methylation is to facilitate the efficient translation of mRNA. The role of mRNA cap ribose 2'-O methylation is enigmatic, although recent work has implicated this as a signature to avoid detection of RNA by the innate immune system (S. Daffis, K. J. Szretter, J. Schriewer, J. Q. Li, S. Youn, J. Errett, T. Y. Lin, S. Schneller, R. Zust, H. P. Dong, V. Thiel, G. C. Sen, V. Fensterl, W. B. Klimstra, T. C. Pierson, R. M. Buller, M. Gale, P. Y. Shi, M. S. Diamond, Nature 468:452-456, 2010, doi:10.1038/nature09489). Working with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), we previously showed that a panel of recombinant VSVs carrying mutations at a predicted methyltransferase catalytic site (rVSV-K1651A, -D1762A, and -E1833Q) or S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site (rVSV-G1670A, -G1672A, and -G4A) were defective in cap methylation and were also attenuated for growth in cell culture. Here, we analyzed the virulence of these recombinants in mice. We found that rVSV-K1651A, -D1762A, and -E1833Q, which are defective in both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation, were highly attenuated in mice. All three viruses elicited a high level of neutralizing antibody and provided full protection against challenge with the virulent VSV. In contrast, mice inoculated with rVSV-G1670A and -G1672A, which are defective only in G-N-7 methylation, were attenuated in vivo yet retained a low level of virulence. rVSV-G4A, which is completely defective in both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation, also exhibited low virulence in mice despite the fact that productive viral replication was not detected in lung and brain. Taken together, our results suggest that abrogation of viral mRNA cap methylation can serve as an approach to attenuate VSV, and perhaps other nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses, for potential application as vaccines and viral vectors. IMPORTANCE Nonsegmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses include a wide range of significant human, animal, and plant pathogens. For many of these viruses, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available. mRNA cap methylation is essential for mRNA stability and efficient translation. Our current understanding of mRNA modifications of NNS RNA viruses comes largely from studies of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In this study, we showed that recombinant VSVs (rVSVs) defective in mRNA cap methylation were attenuated in vitro and in vivo. In addition, these methyltransferase (MTase)-defective rVSVs triggered high levels of antibody responses and provided complete protection against VSV infection. Thus, this study will not only contribute to our understanding of the role of mRNA cap MTase in viral pathogenesis but also facilitate the development of new live attenuated vaccines for VSV, and perhaps other NNS RNA viruses, by inhibiting viral mRNA cap methylation.","Ma, Yuanmei; Wei, Yongwei; Zhang, Xiaodong; Zhang, Yu; Cai, Hui; Zhu, Yang; Shilo, Konstantin; Oglesbee, Michael; Krakowka, Steven; Whelan, Sean P J; Li, Jianrong",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03420-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24371058/,614
148344,An acute-on-chronic health crisis in Gaza.,2021-05-19,"The River Yamuna in Delhi region, the National Capital Territory (NCT) of India, carries potentially toxic metals such as Cr, Pb, Mn, Mg, Hg, Fe and Zn. These contaminants are discharged mainly from industrial wastes, agricultural and household activities and domestic sewage. A total of 12 stations (2.5 to 3.5 km apart from each other) were selected for the study, covering the upstream and downstream areas of river Yamuna in Delhi. The investigated sites were evaluated for significant difference between upstream and downstream locations of river Yamuna in three different time periods (June, October, February). Metal contamination were measured in water, sediments (2 μm) and nearby agriculture soil of the river Yamuna, and found with high metal loads as compared with the international standards, chiefly in the downstream sites as the river flows through the Delhi stretch. The multivariate statistical analysis revealed spatial and temporal variations in the metal concentrations which suggest seasonal variation and common point source of some metals while different sources of other metals. The contamination of the river water and adjoining agriculture soils points towards possible entry of these metals into the food chain. The study indicates that considering the current status of metal pollution, the surface water is not in good conditions for use as drinking purpose because of the high concentrations of few potentially toxic metals. Our study recommends regular monitoring of toxic metals in Yamuna river water and sediments, strict ban on the domestic, agriculture and industrial waste disposal for the restoration of the river to its natural state.","Parmar, Shobhika; Sharma, Vijay K; Singh, Vir; Kharwar, Ravindra N",Environmental monitoring and assessment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08987-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721101/,614

However, recent studies show that the cytoskeletal scaffold, anillin, supports contractile signaling by a novel, non-tethering mechanism that controls the membrane dissociation kinetics of RhoA. More generally, such proof-reading-like scaffolds are distinguished from tethers by a rare type of cooperativity, manifest as a super-linear relationship between scaffold concentration and signaling efficiency.

However, it is unclear whether effects would hold in daily life during COVID-19, when people may have difficulty seeing a path towards their life goals. DESIGN The current study investigated whether purposefulness predicted daily positive affect, negative affect, and physical symptoms. Participants (n = 831) reported on these variables during the first weeks of the COVID-19 response in North America. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Participants completed daily surveys asking them for daily positive events, stressors, positive affect, negative affect, physical symptoms, and purposefulness. RESULTS Purposefulness at between- and within-person levels predicted less negative affect and physical symptoms, but more positive affect at the daily level. Between-person purposefulness interacted with positive events when predicting negative and positive affect, suggesting that purposeful people may be less reactive to positive events. However, between-person purposefulness also interacted with daily stressors, insofar that stressors predicted greater declines in positive affect for purposeful people. CONCLUSION Being a purposeful person holds positive implications for daily health and well-being, even during the pandemic context. However, purposefulness may hold some consequences unique to the COVID-19 context, which merit attention in future research.","Hill, Patrick L; Klaiber, Patrick; Burrow, Anthony L; DeLongis, Anita; Sin, Nancy L",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1914838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974470/,614
150642,A Student Telephone Intervention for Primary Care Patient Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021,"BACKGROUND Because of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic, many primary care practices have transitioned to telehealth visits to keep patients at home and decrease the transmission of the disease. Yet, little is known about the nationwide capacity for delivering primary care services via telehealth. METHODS Using the 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Survey we estimated the number and proportion of reported visits and services that could be provided via telehealth. We also performed cross-tabulations to calculate the number and proportion of physicians providing telephone visits and e-mail/internet encounters. RESULTS Of the total visits (nearly 400 million) to primary care physicians, 42% were amenable to telehealth and 73% of the total services rendered could be delivered through telehealth modalities. Of the primary care physicians, 44% provided telephone consults and 19% provided e-consults. DISCUSSION This study underscores how and where primary care services could be delivered. It provides the first estimates of the capacity of primary care to provide telehealth services for COVID-19 related illness, and for several other acute and chronic medical conditions. It also highlights the fact that, as of 2016, most outpatient telehealth visits were done via telephone. CONCLUSIONS This study provides an estimate of the primary care capacity to deliver telehealth and can guide practices and payers as care delivery models change in a post-COVID 19 environment.","Jetty, Anuradha; Jabbarpour, Yalda; Westfall, Matthew; Kamerow, Douglas B; Petterson, Stephen; Westfall, John M",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622818/,614

152415,The effects of Covid-19 pandemic in volleyball players and sports clubs in Greece.,2020-07-20,"INTRODUCTION The steerable laparoscopic instrument prototype DragonFlex was recently developed with the vision of a minimalistic fully functional design, readily produced by additive manufacturing and requiring little assembly. Steering functionality is provided by rolling joints that, besides simplifying the assembly, help minimise cable fatigue and equalise force requirements on steering cables. However, the perfectly circular rolling joint design introduced some mechanism play, undermining the joint's bending stiffness. Hence, the aim of this paper is to present an innovative solution for play reduction in rolling joints. MATERIAL AND METHODS The original play-compensating mechanism, a shaft-embedded compression spring, proved unsatisfactory for play reduction. Therefore, a new non-circular rolling joint curvature was designed with the objective to compensate for any cable slack and thus minimise the joint play. The new rolling joint design was evaluated in several tip deflection experiments and compared to the original one. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The experimental results proved that the optimised rolling joint curvature significantly minimises play, thus being a major improvement compared to the original design. The optimised rolling joint was implemented in a new real-scale DragonFlex prototype. The presented optimisation method enables elimination of a conventionally used cable tensioning device and it is generally applicable to steerable minimally invasive instruments that use a rolling joint.","Jelínek, Filip; Diepens, Tom; Dobbenga, Sander; van der Jagt, Geert; Kreeft, Davey; Smid, Annemijn; Pessers, Rob; Breedveld, Paul",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2014.968170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25407751/,614
152964,The Great Escape-A Physician Confronts Family Caregiving During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND Tembusu virus (TMUV), classified in the genus Flavivirus, causes reduced egg production and neurological problems in poultry. Flavivirus replication depends on the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress that leads to activation of the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), an important signalling pathway that regulates many biological functions involved in viral pathogenesis and innate immunity. However, the mechanism of TMUV-induced UPR activation remains unclear. RESULTS In this study, we systematically investigated the three UPR pathways in TMUV-infected BHK-21 cells. Our results showed that expression of glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 was upregulated during the course of TMUV infection. We then demonstrated that TMUV activated the PERK pathway in the early stage of infection, resulting in upregulation of ATF4, GADD34 and CHOP, with CHOP induction leading to caspase-3 activation. We also found the IRE1 pathway to be activated, leading to splicing of X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA and enhanced expression of p58IPK. Finally, we observed increased expression of ATF6 and activity of ER stress-response elements, suggesting stimulation of the ATF6 pathway. In addition, ATF6 pathway activation correlated with the induction of downstream chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57 and PDI. UPR activity was also observed by the marked elevation in GRP78 and sXBP1 levels in TMUV-infected DF-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report that TMUV infection-induced ER stress activates three branches of the UPR, and these results lay the foundation for elucidating the pathogenesis of TMUV and understanding the inherent mechanism of TMUV infection as well as the host response.","Zhao, Dongmin; Yang, Jing; Han, Kaikai; Liu, Qingtao; Wang, Huili; Liu, Yuzhuo; Huang, Xinmei; Zhang, Lijiao; Li, Yin",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1781-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30670030/,614

Because the NPI was developed using data obtained from conscious patients with pain, we evaluated the performance of NPI in comparison with the SPI and the analgesia nociception index (ANI) in patients under general anaesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. The time of nociception occurrence was defined as when the signs of inadequate anaesthesia occurred. The median values of NPI, SPI, and ANI for 1 minute from the time of the sign of inadequate anaesthesia were determined as the value of each analgesic index that represents inadequate anaesthesia. The time of no nociception was determined as 2 minutes before the onset of skin incision, and the median value for 1 minute from that time was defined as the baseline value. In total, 81 patients were included in the analysis. NPI showed good performance in distinguishing inadequate anaesthesia during propofol-remifentanil based general anaesthesia. NPI had the highest value in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, albeit without statistical significance (NPI: 0.733, SPI: 0.722, ANI: 0.668). The coefficient of variations of baseline values of NPI, SPI, and ANI were 27.5, 47.2, and 26.1, respectively. Thus, the NPI was effective for detecting inadequate anaesthesia, showing similar performance with both indices and less baseline inter-individual variability than the SPI.","Park, Chanki; Yang, Min-Ho; Choi, Bohyun; Jeon, Bokyung; Lee, Yong-Hun; Shin, Hangsik; Lee, Boreom; Choi, Byung-Moon; Noh, Gyu-Jeong",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64033-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346057/,614
153424,[COVID-19 Concerns and Worries in Patients with Mental Illness].,2020-06-15,"OBJECTIVE To assess the psychosocial outcomes of recipients and their partners 2 and 3 years after entering this first clinical uterus transplantation study. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING University hospital. PATIENT(S) Nine women with absolute uterine factor infertility and their male partners participated. INTERVENTION(S) Psychosocial evaluations using questionnaires focusing on health-related quality-of-life, mood, relationship, and fertility-related quality-of-life were conducted at 2- and 3-year follow-up after transplantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Scores were obtained on the validated questionnaires 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and Fertility Quality of life measuring health-related quality-of-life, mood, relationship, and infertility-associated life quality, respectively. RESULT(S) There was a reversible decrease (at year 2) in the physical component of SF-36 concerning recipients, but not in partners. Negative deviations in the mental component of SF-36 were seen in four recipients, and in two of their partners at year 3, possibly related to the fact that live birth had not been achieved yet among three of these women. Childlessness also seemed to be related to reporting elevated anxiety scores. Most recipients and partners stated high satisfaction with marital relationship both at inclusion and at follow-up. CONCLUSION(S) The results of the present study show that even if the baseline psychosocial characteristics of the women to undergo transplantation and their partners were stable and equal or better compared with norm populations, graft failure and failure to achieve parenthood will pose psychological strains on couples in the period up to 3 years after transplantation. Psychological counseling should be offered past 3 years for recipients and their partners.

METHODS We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of heart transplants performed in Spain in 2019, as well as trends in this procedure from 2010 to 2018. RESULTS In 2019, 300 transplants were performed (8794 since 1984; 2745 between 2010 and 2019). Compared with previous years, the most notable findings were the decreasing rate of urgent transplants (38%), and the consolidation of the type of circulatory support prior to transplant, with an almost complete disappearance of counterpulsation balloon (0.7%), stabilization in the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (9.6%), and an increase in the use of ventricular assist devices (29.0%).

We present the clinical evidence and best practice techniques for currently available devices. METHODS Manufacturer's instructions-for-use were requested for all radiofrequency devices. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched using the following keywords: 'varicose veins' AND 'radiofrequency' OR 'radio frequency' OR 'Venefit' OR 'ClosureFAST' OR 'RFiTT' OR 'EVRF' OR 'VeinCLEAR', generating 240 articles. Titles and abstracts were screened, yielding 63 articles directly relevant to the scope of the review. Reference lists for publications were also searched to identify further manuscripts of relevance. The Cochrane Database and current National Institute for Clinical and Healthcare Excellence guidelines for varicose veins were also searched from relevant articles. RESULTS Four radiofrequency ablation (RFA) systems are currently commercially available. Generic practice methods (common to all RF systems) and device-specific techniques are described. The weight of current evidence relates to the use of Covidien Venefit™ (formerly VNUS ClosureFAST™), which clearly demonstrates clinical advantages over open surgery at least to 2 years follow up. However, contemporary studies of the radiofrequency-induced thermal therapy device (RFiTT®), show that in experienced hands, clinical equivalence to the Venefit™ procedure can be achieved. The evidence base for EVRF® and VeinCLEAR™ devices is currently weak and absent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Despite widespread uptake of RFA and acceptance of its clinical advantages over open surgery there is a paucity of Class 1 A evidence. This results from incongruent reporting of clinical outcome measures within existing literature. Similarly, lack of long-term follow-up studies precludes comparison of the durability of short- and medium-term advantages of RFA with the longer term results of open surgery. There remains scope for a large prospective high-quality trial to assess the clinical, anatomical and cost-effectiveness outcomes for the four commercially available RFA devices, with a particular focus on long-term follow up.","Goodyear, Stephen J; Nyamekye, Isaac K",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355515592771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26556697/,614

METHOD Two female patients (Age: 56a, 42a) underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection for diverticulitis and infiltrating endometriosis of the rectosigmoid colon, respectively. The entire operation was carried out transumbilically following the standardized principles of colorectal resection. RESULTS The operative time was 110 and 180 min, respectively. No intraoperative adverse events or significant perioperative complication was noticed. The specimen measured 22 and 18 cm in length respectively. Estimated blood loss was minimal in both cases. Oral diet was resumed on postoperative day one. Patients were discharged on postoperative day 7 and day 6, respectively. At follow-up, patients presented with an optimal cosmetic result without apparent scarring. CONCLUSION For the first time, a novel laparoscopic technique for sigmoid colon resection utilizing a single intraumbilical approach is presented.

155186,Will changes in alcohol and tobacco use be seen during the COVID-19 lockdown?,2020-04-01,"SIGNIFICANCE An increasing number of pathogens are acquiring resistance to antibiotics. Efficient antimicrobial drug regimens are important even for the most advanced therapies, which range from cutting-edge invasive clinical protocols, such as robotic surgeries, to the treatment of harmless bacterial diseases and to minor scratches to the skin. Therefore, there is an urgent need to survey alternative antimicrobial drugs that can reinforce or replace existing antibiotics. Recent Advances: Bacterial proteins that are critical for energy metabolism, promising novel anticancer thiourea derivatives, and the use of synthetic molecules that increase the sensitivity of currently used antibiotics, are among the recently discovered antimicrobial drugs. CRITICAL ISSUES In the development of new drugs, serious consideration should be given to the previous bacterial evolutionary selection caused by antibiotics, by the high proliferation rate of bacteria, and by the simple prokaryotic structure of bacteria. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The survey of drug targets has mainly focused on bacterial proteins, although host signaling molecules involved in the treatment of various pathologies may have unknown antimicrobial characteristics. Recent data have suggested that small molecule inhibitors might enhance the effect of antibiotics, e.g., by limiting bacterial entry into host cells. Phagocytosis, the mechanism by which host cells internalize pathogens through β-actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, induces calcium signaling, small GTPase activation, and phosphorylation of the PI3K-AKT pathway.","Bonavita, Raffaella; Laukkanen, Mikko Olavi",Antioxidants & redox signaling,https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2019.7968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600071/,614
155564,Associations of screen work with neck and upper extremity symptoms: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The STAIR (Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable) meeting aims to advance acute stroke therapy development through collaboration between academia, industry, and regulatory institutions. In pursuit of this goal and building on recently available level I evidence of benefit from endovascular therapy (ET) in large vessel occlusion stroke, STAIR IX consensus recommendations were developed that outline priorities for future research in ET. METHODS Three key directions for advancing the field were identified: (1) development of systems of care for ET in large vessel occlusion stroke, (2) development of therapeutic approaches adjunctive to ET, and (3) exploring clinical benefit of ET in patient population insufficiently studied in recent trials. Methodological issues such as optimal trial design and outcome measures have also been addressed. RESULTS Development of systems of care strategies should be geared both toward ensuring broad access to ET for eligible patients and toward shortening time to reperfusion to the minimum possible. Adjunctive therapy development includes neuroprotective approaches, adjuvant microcirculatory/collateral enhancing strategies, and periprocedural management. Future research priorities seeking to expand the eligible patient population are to determine benefit of ET in patients presenting beyond conventional time windows, in patients with large baseline ischemic core lesions, and in other important subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Research priorities in ET for large vessel occlusion stroke are to improve systems of care, investigate effective adjuvant therapies, and explore whether patient eligibility could be expanded.","Jovin, Tudor G; Albers, Gregory W; Liebeskind, David S",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.013578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27586682/,614

Case History We describe a 79-year-old female who underwent a left hemicolectomy due to a stenotic lesion shown on colonoscopy: an adenocarcinoma (pT3NO, G2). One year after surgery, control colonoscopy revealed an AR, so a new resection was carried out. Pathology showed it to be a recurrent adenocarcinoma over the staple line (pT3N0, G2). One year after the second surgical procedure, control colonoscopy evinced a new AR, resulting in a new resection. Pathology revealed a new AR. Conclusions This is only the second time that a second isolated AR after curative resection for colorectal cancer has been reported.","Bailon-Cuadrado, M; Blanco-Alvarez, J I; Velasco-Lopez, R; Rodriguez-Lopez, M",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2016.0318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791414/,614

OBJECTIVES The available data are based on symptomatic cases, and do not include the asymptomatic ones. To measure the exact infection rate, we initiated a study that aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 antibodies (SARS-CoV-2) in IBD. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eight hundred sixty-four subjects were enrolled in the study, including 432 IBD patients (290 with Crohn's disease and 142 with ulcerative colitis) and 432 non-IBD control group individuals (health professionals) matched for age and gender. Serum samples were prospectively collected, and the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies were measured by using the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) method (Vircell Microbiologists®). RESULTS A significantly higher percentage of positive results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, both in the IgG and IgM+IgA class, was found in IBD patients (4.6% and 6% respectively, compared to 1.6% and 1.1%; p<0.05). No patient had symptomatic COVID-19. There was no association among patients' age, gender, drugs used for IBD or disease activity, and the occurrence of IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION IBD patients may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as the presence of elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, but not of symptomatic and/or severe COVID-19 course, when compared to non-IBD health professionals.","Łodyga, Michał; Maciejewska, Katarzyna; Eder, Piotr; Waszak, Katarzyna; Stawczyk-Eder, Kamila; Michalak, Michał; Dobrowolska, Agnieszka; Wiśniewska-Jarosińska, Maria; Gąsiorowska, Anita; Cicha, Małgorzata; Wierzba, Waldemar; Rydzewska, Grażyna",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544564/,614

In view of preventing the disease spread and maintaining social distancing the educational institutes including medical schools are closed in most countries struggling with the current pandemic. The decision is based on some evidences showing that the lockdown is one of the important tools to decrease transmission rates, delay the doubling time and flatten the curve. Unlike many other subjects and specialty, medicine has to be taught on patients and in the hospital setting. In this context there are several unanswered questions regarding the teaching and training of undergraduate medical students and the most important question being what is the best approach without compromising the safety as well as educational objectives and without overburdening the system? This article discusses some of these issues.

The isolates were collected for species identification by oligonucleotide hybridization and sequence analysis. A total of 96 cases of proven or probable IA were identified according to published criteria. The incidence of IA has increased significantly during the study period. Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus (41.7% each) were equally prevalent causative species. IA due to unusual species including A. nidulans (n=2), A. versicolor (n=2), and A. tubingensis (n=1) were also found. Among patients with IA, 55.2% had hematological disorder, 19.8% had underlying lung disorder, and 10.4% had autoimmune disease. The isolates species (P<0.001) and underlying disease (P<0.001) significantly affect the association of a positive culture with invasive disease. The overall mortality at three months was 62.5%, which remained stable throughout the study period. Multivariate analysis identified prior steroid use (P=0.007) as a significant risk factor for death, while surgery (P=0.030) and voriconazole (P=0.012) had protective effects. In conclusion, autoimmune disorders and underlying pulmonary diseases should also be considered as important predisposing factors of IA. Further emphasis on surgery and voriconazole in the management of IA might be beneficial.","Hsiue, H-C; Wu, T-H; Chang, T-C; Hsiue, Y-C; Huang, Y-T; Lee, P-I; Hsueh, P-R",European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-011-1445-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997774/,614

We investigated barriers and facilitators to vaccine acceptance within 3 months of regulatory approval (primary outcome) among adult employees and students at a tertiary-care, academic medical center. METHODS We used a cross-sectional survey design with multivariable logistic regression. Covariates included age, gender, educational attainment, self-reported health status, concern about COVID-19, direct patient interaction, and prior influenza immunization. RESULTS Of 18,250 eligible persons, 3,347 participated. Two in 5 (40.5%) HCP intend to delay (n = 1020; 30.6%) or forgo (n = 331; 9.9%) vaccination. Male sex (adjusted OR [aOR], 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00-2.95; P < .001), prior influenza vaccination (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.75-3.18; P < .001), increased concern about COVID-19 (aOR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.07-2.79; P < .001), and postgraduate education (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.21-1.65; P < .001) - but not age, direct patient interaction, or self-reported overall health - were associated with vaccine acceptance in multivariable analysis. Barriers to vaccination included concerns about long-term side effects (n = 1197, 57.1%), safety (n = 1152, 55.0%), efficacy (n = 777, 37.1%), risk-to-benefit ratio (n = 650, 31.0%), and cost (n = 255, 12.2%).Subgroup analysis of Black respondents indicates greater hesitancy to accept vaccination (only 24.8% within 3 months; aOR 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.21; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Many HCP intend to delay or refuse COVID-19 vaccination. Policymakers should impartially address concerns about safety, efficacy, side effects, risk-to-benefit ratio, and cost.

Letter.,2021-02-19,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence of respiratory viral infections in patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS 108 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected from 22 PID patients before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from July 2016 to July 2018 in the Department of Hematology. The TR-PCR was used to detect for respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus(RSV)，human metapneumoviros(hMPV)，coronavirus(CoV) and parainfluenza 1-3 (PIV1-3). And the clinical characteristics and co-infection were analyzed. RESULTS Among the total 108 specimens, viral pathogens were identified in 41 (37.96%) specimens. Among which the pathogens of highest detection rate was RSV (25.9%). Different types of PID showed different virus infection rates, among which the highest infection rate was severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) patients, with the virus detection rate was 57.9%. The incidence of co-infection with two or more than two viruses was 19.5%. CONCLUSION Patients with PID who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are more susceptible to respiratory viruses. RSV is an important respiratory tract virus pathogen after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","Huang, Yu; Chen, Zhi; Meng, Yan; Guan, Xian-Min; Yu, Jie; Zhao, Xiao-Dong; Dou, Ying",Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.03.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552976/,614
161942,Socio-economic impact on epilepsy outside of the nation-wide COVID-19 pandemic area.,2021-03-10,"DNA metabarcoding is an important tool for molecular ecology. However, its effectiveness hinges on the quality of reference sequence databases and classification parameters employed. Here we evaluate the performance of MiFish 12S taxonomic assignments using a case study of California Current Large Marine Ecosystem fishes to determine best practices for metabarcoding. Specifically, we use a taxonomy cross-validation by identity framework to compare classification performance between a global database comprised of all available sequences and a curated database that only includes sequences of fishes from the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We demonstrate that the regional database provides higher assignment accuracy than the comprehensive global database. We also document a tradeoff between accuracy and misclassification across a range of taxonomic cutoff scores, highlighting the importance of parameter selection for taxonomic classification. Furthermore, we compared assignment accuracy with and without the inclusion of additionally generated reference sequences. To this end, we sequenced tissue from 597 species using the MiFish 12S primers, adding 252 species to GenBank's existing 550 California Current Large Marine Ecosystem fish sequences. We then compared species and reads identified from seawater environmental DNA samples using global databases with and without our generated references, and the regional database. The addition of new references allowed for the identification of 16 additional native taxa representing 17.0% of total reads from eDNA samples, including species with vast ecological and economic value. Together these results demonstrate the importance of comprehensive and curated reference databases for effective metabarcoding and the need for locus-specific validation efforts.","Gold, Zachary; Curd, Emily E; Goodwin, Kelly D; Choi, Emma S; Frable, Benjamin W; Thompson, Andrew R; Walker, Harold J; Burton, Ronald S; Kacev, Dovi; Martz, Lucas D; Barber, Paul H",Molecular ecology resources,https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.13450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235858/,614

163485,Social medias in increasing anxiety around COVID-19 in Morocco,2021,"Background: The trail of the transmission of COVID-19 in Africa needs to be understood and conceptualized. With the limited response time to curb the transmission, the pandemic is already in 52 countries in Africa. There is much anxiety about the devastating potential of this scourge in Africa, justifiably so because of the weak health systems, high levels of poverty, and overcrowded cities. Therefore, this report examined the association between the confirmed cases at 100 days of COVID-19 and some significant risk factors in 19 African countries that had at least 100 confirmed cases as of 09 April 2020. Materials and Methods: We evaluated four major risk factors associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases in 19 African counties with over 100 cases in 100 days after the official declaration of COVID-19 by WHO. Results: Three of the four risk factors (total population in urban areas, population age, and international exposure) correlated positively with the number of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, one (public health system) correlated negatively with the number of confirmed cases in the countries under study. International exposure was initially the main transmitter of the infection, but community transmission now becomes the driver of COVID-19 infections on the continent. Conclusion: Identification of confirmed cases, quick contact tracing with self-isolation, community engagement, and health systems measures are all-necessary to prevent the potentially harmful ramifications of an epidemic on the continent. There is, therefore, the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach between the government and society. © 2021, Touch Medical Media. All rights reserved.","Shallie, P.

World Health Organization (WHO) has already declared a global pandemic warning. It appears most of the infection resulted deaths are mainly due to dysfunctions or failures of the lung or multiple organs that could be attributed to host s immunodysfunction or related disorders. In this work, a model is proposed to correlate the Pathogen Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus Proinflammatory Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS) levels within a host unit, where a maximum PIRP is exhibited when the PIAPS levels are equal to or around PIAPS equilibrium levels at the pathogen elimination or clearance onset. Based on this model, rational or effective therapeutic strategies at right stages or timing, with right type of agents (immunostimulators or immunosuppressors) and right dosages, can be designed and implemented that are expected to effectively achieve maximum PIRP or reduce the mortality.","Sun, Sam-Shajing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05507v2.pdf,614

Transportation industry which is deemed as an essential activity should continue to operate through the lockdowns while making it certain to exercise social distancing. Although some researchers, Departments of Transportation (DOT), Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and private organizations have provided vital information and guidelines to mitigate the unintended consequences of the pandemic, the impacts of COVID-19 on various types of transportation modes have been rarely analyzed and compared. This paper gives rich information into the system and cognizance of the effect of COVID-19 and the developments that the transportation area has needed to embrace so as to cling to the lockdown rules while being operational and productive. The study contributes towards advising policymakers, stakeholders, and agencies on certain insights gained from the management of the COVID-19 from a transportation area point of view. Moreover, four key regulations are concluded for leaders inside the transportation framework business to reevaluate and act to manage the pandemic emergency. This research analyzes how each sector has addressed the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic and results of the study concluded that the survival of transportation industry is not solely reliant on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic but on the resilience adapted by the different sectors to cope up with the situation.

167566,Paramedics feelings and beliefs about COVID-19,2021,"The pandemic threat of COVID-19 with more than 37 million cases in which about 5 percent entering critical stage characterized by cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory condition, the state more often leads to admission to intensive care unit with rapid mortality. Janus kinase enzymes of Jak-1, Jak-2, Jak-3, and Tyk2 seem to be good targets for inhibition by medications to control cytokine storm in this context. In the present work, the inhibitory properties of different analgesic drugs on these targets are studied to assess their ability for clinical application from different points of view. Our docking results indicated that naproxen, methadone, and amitriptyline considering their higher binding energy, lower energy variance, and higher hydrophobicity, seem to express more inhibitory effects on Janus kinase enzymes than thats for approved inhibitors i.e. baricitinib and ruxolitinib. Accordingly, we suggest our wide list of candidate drugs including indomethacin, etodolac, buprenorphine, rofecoxib, duloxetine, valdecoxib, naproxen, methadone, and amitriptilin for clinical assessments for their usefulness in COVID-19 treatment, especially taking into account that up to now, there is no approved cure for this disease.","Dayer, Mohammad Reza",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12332v1.pdf,614
167784,"Knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 outbreak among the personnel providing emergency services in India",2021,"Current diagnostic methods used to evaluate patients with pharyngitis for the presence of group A Streptococcus (GAS) do not discriminate between acute infection and asymptomatic carriage, potentially resulting in overuse of antibiotics. We hypothesized that host response as measured by the transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood leukocytes could make this distinction, and could also distinguish between GAS and viral infection. We used RNA sequencing to generate whole blood transcriptomes from 37 children, including 10 with acute GAS pharyngitis, 5 with asymptomatic GAS carriage, 3 with adenoviral pharyngitis, 3 with pharyngitis of unknown etiology, and 16 asymptomatic children negative for GAS. Transcriptional profiles from children with symptomatic GAS, GAS carriage, symptomatic adenoviral pharyngitis, and controls were each distinct. Of 15,185 genes with analyzable sequence, 1357 (8.9%) were differentially expressed in the children with symptomatic GAS compared to those with asymptomatic carriage, and 1336 (8.8%) compared to symptomatic adenovirus infection. A panel of 13 genes distinguished between children with acute GAS and all others with 91% accuracy. The gene encoding CD177, a marker of neutrophil activation, had a 152-fold increase in expression in children with acute GAS, and is a potential diagnostic biomarker. We conclude that measurement of host response is highly promising to improve the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis and could help limit unnecessary antibiotic use.","Yu, J.; Tychsen, E.; Yang, W.; Mariani, T.

168350,Burn-out syndrome in healthcare practitioners- a narrative literature review,2021,"Background: YAs, aged 18-30 years, with T1D have high risk of worsening glycemic control and loss to follow-up. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic required a sudden change in healthcare delivery from in-person to telehealth visits. We aimed to evaluate use of telehealth by YAs with T1D during this time and assess characteristics associated with telehealth usage. Method: Frequency of telehealth visits from 3/16/2020 to 9/30/2020 was compared with in-person visits during the same calendar period before COVID-19 (3/16/2019 to 9/30/2020) in a sample of YAs with T1D seen by pediatric and adult diabetes clinicians. The Electronic Health Record provided demographic and clinical data for YAs aged 18-30 with a pre-pandemic A1c. Descriptive statistics and t-tests compared data before and during COVID-19. Results: Pre-COVID-19, there were 1177 YAs (50% male) with mean±SD age 24.4±3.4 years, T1D duration 12.8±5.9 years, and A1c 8.1±1.6%;46% were pump-treated, 55% used CGM, and 91% had private insurance. In 2019, there were 2961 visits;in 2020, there were 2701 visits. For the two 6-month periods, the mean number of visits per YA declined significantly, from 2.5±2.5 in 2019 to 2.3±3.1 in 2020 (p=.02). Further, 20% (n=240) of YAs had no visits during the pandemic period. YAs with an A1c <7% pre-pandemic (21%, n=247) had fewer visits during the pandemic than before the pandemic (1.6±2.7 vs. 2.2±2.7, p=.001). YA males (p=.01), those using CGM (p=.02), and those on injection based therapy (p=.0002) had fewer visits during COVID-19. Conclusions: The majority of YAs (80%) maintained follow-up T1D care during the initial six months of telehealth implementation due to COVID-19, especially those with less favorable characteristics (e.g., A1c ≥7%, no CGM use). Maintaining telehealth options can become an effective means to improve future health outcomes for at-risk groups, such as YAs with T1D.","Shapira, Amit Tinsley Liane J.; Freiner, Emily Laffel Lori M.; Toschi, Elena",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-855-p,614

In this chapter, we introduce two control functions in the compartmental SEIR model representing vaccination and plasma transfusion. Optimal control problems are proposed to study the effects of these two control measures, on the reduction of infected individuals and increase of recovered ones, with minimal costs. Up to our knowledge, the plasma transfusion treatment has never been considered as a control strategy for epidemics mitigation. The proposed vaccination and treatment strategies may have a real application in the challenging and hard problem of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Couras, Juliana; Area, Ivan; Nieto, Juan J.; Silva, Cristiana J.; Torres, Delfim F.

A great deal of effort has focused on preventing the misfolding and aggregation of SOD1 as a potential therapy for ALS, however, the results have been mixed. Here, we utilise a small-molecule polytherapy of CuATSM and ebselen to mimic the metal delivery and disulfide bond promoting activity of SOD1’s cellular chaperone, the ‘copper chaperone for SOD1’ (CCS). We find that polytherapy using CuATSM and ebselen is highly effective at reducing inclusion formation in a cell model of SOD1 aggregation, reduces mutant SOD1-associated cell death, and promotes effective maturation of SOD1 beyond either compound alone. Our data suggest that a polytherapy of CuATSM and ebselen may be an effective method of treating SOD1-associated ALS.","L., McAlary; V.K., Shephard; G.S.A., Wright; J.J., Yerbury",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.22.432389,614

In the area of political morality, the issue of what counts as a fair allocation of resources, which may generally come in the form of being benefits or burdens, is referred to as the issue of distributive justice. In this essay, I look into the issue of distributive justice in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. After examining the basic claims of the various theories of distributive justice and how they apply to healthcare resource allocations, I then advance a framework for evaluating the moral justifiability of prioritization schemes for a fair allocation of healthcare resources, especially the vaccines, during the pandemic. The framework basically incorporates moral considerations based on welfare, capabilities, and opportunities. © 2021. Napoleon M. Mabaquiao, Jr.","Mabaquiao, N.

168718,"Knowledge, awareness and practices (kap) about covid-19 in jazan",2021,"Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual care (i.e. telephone or videoconference) has played a critical role. However, concerns were raised regarding equitable access for older adults, in particular, given potential advantages of videoconference- as opposed to telephone-based assessment. Our objective was to describe patient-specific factors associated with different modes of virtual healthcare. Methods We reviewed medical records of all patients assessed virtually in a geriatric medicine clinic in Toronto, Canada, between March 17 and July 13, 2020. We derived adjusted odds ratios (OR), risk differences (RD), and marginal and predicted probabilities, with 95% confidence intervals, from a multivariable logistic regression model, which tested the association between having a videoconference assessment (vs. a telephone assessment) and patient age, sex, ability to use a computer, education, frailty (measured on the Clinical Frailty Scale), history of cognitive impairment, and immigration history; language of assessment, and caregiver involvement in assessment. Results Our study included 330 patients (227 telephone and 103 videoconference assessments). Frailty (adjusted OR 0.62, 0.45 to 0.85; adjusted RD -0.08, -0.09 to -0.06) and absence of a caregiver (adjusted OR 0.12, 0.06 to 0.24; adjusted RD -0.35, -0.43 to -0.26) were associated with lower odds of videoconference assessment. For example, an 80-year-old woman with mild frailty who immigrated to Canada, speaks English, attained a post-secondary education, does not have cognitive impairment, and uses a computer had a 60% (39% to 80%) predicted probability of videoconference assessment if a caregiver was present compared to 15% (3% to 26%) without a caregiver. Only 32 of 98 (32.7%) patients who could independently use a computer participated in videoconference assessments. Conclusion Given the recent expansion of virtual care, we must urgently implement and evaluate strategies that optimise equitable access to videoconference-based virtual care for older adults.","Liu, L.; Goodarzi, Z.; Jones, A.; Posno, R.; Straus, S.; Watt, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205302v1?rss=1,614
168818,Women's health inequities during covid-19: a rapid scoping review,2021,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is one of the main air pollution problems that occur in major cities around the world. A country’s PM2.5 can be affected not only by country factors but also by the neighboring country’s air quality factors. Therefore, forecasting PM2.5 requires collecting data from outside the country as well as from within which is necessary for policies and plans. The data set of many variables with a relatively small number of observations can cause a dimensionality problem and limit the performance of the deep learning model. This study used daily data for five years in predicting PM2.5 concentrations in eight Korean cities through deep learning models. PM2.5 data of China were collected and used as input variables to solve the dimensionality problem using principal components analysis (PCA). The deep learning models used were a recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). The performance of the models with and without PCA was compared using root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). As a result, the application of PCA in LSTM and BiLSTM, excluding the RNN, showed better performance: decreases of up to 16.6% and 33.3% in RMSE and MAE values. The results indicated that applying PCA in deep learning time series prediction can contribute to practical performance improvements, even with a small number of observations. It also provides a more accurate basis for the establishment of PM2.5 reduction policy in the country.","Choi, Sang Won Kim Brian H. S.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13073726,614

The 37th annual adult lung transplant report submitted data to the ISHLT TTX Registry on 67,493 adult recipients of deceased donor transplants between January 1, 1992 and June 30, 2018. In recent years more than 5000 heart transplants and approximately 4000 lung transplants have been performed annually across 388 centres worldwide. Heart transplantation is a proven surgical option for selected patients with advanced heart failure refractory to surgical or medical management. Lung transplantation is the definitive treatment for end-stage lung disease in patients who have failed medical therapy. More than 90% of adult patients presenting for heart transplantation have dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Anaesthetic principles for heart transplantation comprise full monitoring, including transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiostable anaesthesia and cardiac support with assessment and treatment of pulmonary vascular hypertension. Median survival after cardiac transplantation is 11.9 years. Lung transplantation includes single-lung, double-lung, bilateral sequential single-lung, heart–lung and lobar transplantation. The most common indication, representing more than one-third of all transplant recipients, is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Donor criteria have become more liberal and lung transplants may involve cardiopulmonary bypass. Pre-bypass air trapping can compromise cardiac function. Postoperative ventilation management should be guided by pH, not PaCO2. Thoracic epidural analgesia provides optimal pain relief without respiratory depression. Five-year survival after lung transplantation is approximately 65%.","Parizkova, B.; Wright, G.",Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpaic.2021.03.005,614
169588,Use of Telehealth by Surgical Specialties during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Changes in a few key transcriptional regulators can lead to different biological states, including cell activation and differentiation, and diseases. Extracting the key gene regulators governing a biological state allows us to gain mechanistic insights and can further help in translational research. Most current tools perform pathway/GO enrichment analysis to identify key genes and regulators but tend to overlook the regulatory interactions between genes and proteins. Here we present RegEnrich, an open-source Bioconductor R package, which combines differential expression analysis, data-driven gene regulatory network inference, enrichment analysis, and gene regulator ranking to identify key regulators using gene/protein expression profiling data. By benchmarking using multiple gene expression datasets of gene silencing studies, we found that RegEnrich using the GSEA method to rank the regulators performed the best to retrieve the key regulators. Further, RegEnrich was applied to 21 publicly available datasets on in vitro interferon-stimulation of different cell types. We found that not only IRF and STAT transcription factor families played an important role in cells responding to IFN, but also several ETS transcription factor family members, such as ELF1 and ETV7, are highly associated with IFN stimulations. Collectively, RegEnrich can accurately identify key gene regulators from the cells under different biological states in a data-driven manner, which can be valuable in mechanistically studying cell differentiation, cell response to drug stimulation, disease development, and ultimately drug development.","Tao, Weiyang; Radstake, Timothy R.D.J.; Pandit, Aridaman",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.428029,614

Prior knowledge influences our decisions, potentially creating implicit cognitive conflict with new, correct information. COVID-19 provides a natural condition for investigating how an individual’s health-specific knowledge (e.g., understanding mask efficacy) and their personal context (e.g., outbreak proximity) influence their protective health behavior endorsement, as information about the virus, its spread, and lethality has changed over time. Using a dual-process-model framework, we investigated the role cognitive conflict has on health decision-making. We used a computer mouse-tracking paradigm alongside geographical information systems, (GIS) as a proxy for context. The results support a contextualized-deficit-model framework in which relevant knowledge and context-based factors help individuals override cognitive conflict to make more preventative health decisions.

Materials and Methods We developed three Random Forest models and updated the Modified Hospital One-year Mortality Risk model: alternative models to predict one-year mortality (proxy for EOL status) using admission-time data. Admissions from July 2011-2016 were used for training and those from July 2017-2018 were used for temporal validation. We simulated alerts for admissions in the validation cohort and modelled alternative scenarios where alerts lead to code status orders (CSOs) in the EHR. We linked actual CSOs and calculated the expected risk difference (eRD), the number needed to benefit (NNB) and the net benefit (NB) of each model for the patient-centered outcome of a CSO among EOL hospitalizations. Results Models had a C-statistic of 0.79-0.86 among unique patients. A CSO was documented during 2599 of 3773 hospitalizations at the EOL (68.9%). At a threshold that identified 10% of eligible admissions, the eRD ranged from 5.4% to 10.7% (NNB 5.4-10.9 alerts). Under usual care, a CSO had a 34% PPV for EOL status. Using this to inform the relative cost of FPs, only two models improved NB over usual care. A RF model with diagnostic predictors had the highest clinical utility by either measure, including in sensitivity analyses. Discussion Automatable prediction models with acceptable temporal validity differed meaningfully in their expected ability to improve patient-centered outcomes over usual care. Conclusion Decision-analysis should precede implementation of automated prediction models for improving palliative and EOL care outcomes.","Taseen, R.; Ethier, J.-F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.27.21254465v1?rss=1,614

It is essential to understand the level of anxiety among rheumatic disease patients at the current situation of COVID-19. Objectives and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional multicenter survey was done across 5 rheumatology centers in India. The study duration was between 9 measured by Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results: The survey was sent to 2987 patients, there were 933 responses, and 581 were complete (male = 175). Complete responses were considered for data analysis. Rheumatoid arthritis was the most frequent (50.6%) diagnosis followed by other conditions. Most of the patients (43%) were on combination disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy, 12.7% of patients were on biological drugs, and 23.9% of patients were on glucocorticoids (GCs). Statistically significant higher anxiety scores were observed in females (8.79 ± 9.3), fibromyalgia patients (19.78 ± 14.8), patients on GCs (9.26 ± 8.8), and biological agents (10.65 ± 10.6). Difficulty in meeting rheumatologists and getting medications was expressed by 327 (56.2%) and 73 (29.7%) respondents, respectively. Conclusion: The findings of the study revealed that anxiety is a major concern in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases.

However, teachers may not share the same perspective related to the policy. This study aims to examine Islamic Religious Education (IRE) teachers’ perspectives on Independent Learning policy. The research participants were IRE teachers who passed the 2019 In-service Teacher Profession Training Program at a State Islamic University in East Java, Indonesia. The mix-method research design with a qualitative-quantitative sequential exploratory analysis was used in this study. Qualitative data were obtained through telephone interviews, non-participant observations, and investigative documentary tracing, while quantitative data were obtained through a survey using online questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed using the descriptive qualitative phenomenological technique and descriptive statistics. The findings show that the increase in the use of mobile learning by IRE teachers is an implication of the disruption leading to the mobilization of the educational sector to approach the Independent Learning policy based on performances in three perspectives. First, the policy is considered a critique of traditional educational practices. Second, the policy serves as a space for independence with rules and regulations that are more open for students and schools. Third, the policy is an effort to free education from social and political pressures and restraints.

However, the increasing number of studies on the subject show mixed results and currently, there is a certain disillusionment regarding its benefits. And yet, the Covid-19 crisis has revealed the importance of developing digital-based complementary support to existing resources.ObjectivesFactors associated with higher utilization rates among the target audience need to be investigated.MethodsIn 2018, 41 French cities enrolled in an intervention program aimed at promoting StopBlues®, a digital health tool that helps prevent mental distress and suicide among the general population. After two years of experimentation, a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was performed using quantitative and qualitative data collection methods from institutional sources, questionnaires and web analytics tools.ResultsFinding trends show that higher utilization rates were associated with the involvement of general practitioners (GPs) in the promotion of StopBlues and the use of digital marketing channels. Context-specific characteristics also played an important role in the adoption of the tool.ConclusionsThe local context has a strong influence on how digital tools are locally promoted and accepted. Further research is needed to understand how local actors and specifically GPs can be involved in suicide prevention. More broadly, the challenge today is to ensure acceptance of digital health technology among targeted populations by adapting the digital offer to their needs and promoting the available tools.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Turmaine, K.; Jeannic, A.

171597,Personal traits and coping strategies in compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures,2021,"Background: The rise of major complex public health problems, such as vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination, requires innovative, open and transdisciplinary approaches. In spite of this, institutional silos, paywalls and lack of participation of non-academic citizens in the design of solutions hamper efforts to meet these challenges. Against this background, new solutions have been explored, with participatory research, citizen science, hackathon and challenge-based approaches being applied in the context of public health. Objectives: Our ambition was to develop a framework for creating citizen science and open innovation projects that address the contemporary challenges of vaccination in France and around the globe. Methods: We designed and implemented Co-Immune, a programme created to tackle the question of vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination through an online and offline challenge-based open innovation approach. The programme was run on the open science platform Just One Giant Lab. Results: Over a 6-month period, the Co-Immune programme gathered 234 participants of diverse backgrounds and 13 partners from the public and private sectors and organized 8 events to facilitate the creation of 20 new projects as well as the continuation of 2 existing projects to address the issues of vaccination hesitancy and access, ranging from app development and data mining to analysis and game design. In an open framework, the projects made their data, code, and solutions publicly available. Conclusion: Co-Immune highlights how open innovation approaches and online platforms can help to gather and coordinate non-institutional communities in a rapid, distributed and global way towards solving public health issues. Through the ideas of hackathons and other contest approaches, such initiatives can lead to the production and transfer of knowledge, creating novel solutions in the public health sector. The example of Co-Immune contributes to paving the way for organisations and individuals to collaboratively tackle future global challenges.","Masselot, C. M.; Greshake Tzovaras, B.; Graham, C. L.

This new place-based community development program encourages the investment of private capital into economically depressed areas through the use of tax incentives. With significant tax-induced demand, a small “investment box,” and a closing (now closed) window of opportunity for full tax benefits, conditions have been ripe for accelerating o-zone property prices. This study examines the policy’s effect on transaction prices for existing market-rate apartment properties located in census tracts that were designated as o-zones. It finds that certain segments of the apartment investment pool located in o-zones experienced significant price increases between 2017 and 2019. With material sales price increases, the benefits related to tax savings, at least in part, have effectively been transferred to the sellers of these properties. This finding acts as a cautionary reminder to taxable investors. While tax benefits are alluring, investment decisions should not rely on tax incentives alone.

As telework becomes more widespread, these flexible models of work are rapidly expanding to new categories of employees, changing the factors traditionally found to be important for telework eligibility. The aim of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of new profiles of teleworkers, examining main factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of different TICTM arrangements. We apply multinomial logistic regression models to a sample of more than 20,000 workers from the 6th European Working Conditions Survey. Our findings confirm the heterogeneity in the profiles of teleworkers, particularly distinguishing by TICTM arrangement. Occasional teleworkers are usually male managers or professionals, but a relevant percentage of highly mobile teleworkers are technicians and associate professionals, while clerical support workers amount to a large group of home-based teleworkers. The majority of occasional and highly mobile teleworkers are still men, but this can no longer be said of home-based teleworkers. The correlations between telework and permanent contracts, full-time jobs, and living in urban areas are weak, showing that TICTM is spreading into more precarious, temporary, and lower-paid jobs, especially among home-based teleworkers and highly mobile teleworkers.","López-Igual, Purificación",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12218797,614

The emergence of nanotechnological tools has provided an attractive perspective in designing portable bioanalytical assays with fast response time, high sensitivity and specificity, and multiplexing capability for accurate, on-site disease diagnosis and monitoring. Due to their versatile optical properties, plasmonic nanoparticles (PNPs) are appealing candidates for biosensing applications. This review summarizes the advances in the application of PNPs for CRP detection and quantification.

This paper aims to investigate library leadership in Nigeria and COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Descriptive research design was used for the study. A structured questionnaire designed with Google Form and administered online was used to elicit data from 137 heads of academic and public libraries and their deputies in South West, Nigeria. Findings: It was found that transformational and transactional leadership styles were more effective than laissez-faire style in managing libraries during crisis. Library operations were reduced during the COVID-19 era, and communication and meetings were conducted via social media. The spread of the pandemic was curtailed through enforcement of the use of face mask and nose covers and awareness campaign through posters and handbills. Practical implications: It is the library heads with effective leadership styles that will be productive in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value: This study is novel, as it approaches the handling of COVID-19 in libraries from the perspective of the leadership styles of the library leaders. No studies have emanated from Africa in this area. The few available narratives are centred around the Western countries.

Those with existing comorbidities and minority ethnic groups have been found to be at increased risk of mortality. We wished to determine if there were any differences in intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 30-day hospital mortality in a city with high levels of deprivation and a large community of people of South Asian heritage. Methods: Detailed information on 622 COVID-19-positive inpatients in Bradford and Calderdale between February-August 2020 were extracted from Electronic Health Records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between ethnicity with admission to ICU and 30-day mortality, respectively accounting for the effect of demographic and clinical confounders. Results: The sample consisted of 408 (70%) White, 142 (24%) South Asian and 32 (6%) other minority ethnic patients. Ethnic minority patients were younger, more likely to live in deprived areas, and be overweight/obese, have type 2 diabetes, hypertension and asthma compared to white patients, but were less likely to have cancer (South Asian patients only) and COPD. Male and obese patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU, and patients of South Asian ethnicity, older age, and those with cancer were less likely. Being male, older age, deprivation, obesity, and cancer were associated with 30-day mortality. The risk of death in South Asian patients was the same as in white patients HR 1.03 (0.58, 1.82). Conclusions: Despite South Asian patients being less likely to be admitted to ICU and having a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity, there was no difference in the risk of death compared to white patients. This contrasts with other findings and highlights the value of studies of communities which may have different ethnic, deprivation and clinical risk profiles.","Santorelli, G.; McCooe, M.; Sheldon, T.

However, little is known about the relationship between amygdala connectivity and subsequent stress-induced behavior. The current study investigated whether amygdala connectivity measured before experiencing stress is a predisposing neural feature of subsequent stress-induced behavior while individuals face an emergent and unexpected event like the COVID-19 outbreak. Using an fMRI cohort established before the pandemic in Wuhan, Hubei, we found that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the right amygdala with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was negatively correlated with the stress-induced behavior of these volunteers during the COVID-2019 outbreak in Hubei. Furthermore, the self-connection of the right amygdala, inferred using dynamic causal modeling, was negatively correlated with stress-induced behavior in this cohort. A significant correlation between the right amygdala-dmPFC rsFC and self-connection of the right amygdala was found. Additionally, after three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei when the stressor weakened - and in another cohort collected in regions outside Hubei where the individuals experienced a lower level of stress - the relationship between the amygdala-dmPFC rsFC and the stress-induced behavior disappeared. Our findings support that amygdala connectivity is a predisposing neural feature of stress-induced behavior in the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei, suggesting the amygdala connectivity before stress predicts subsequent behavior while facing an emergent and unexpected event. And thus our findings provide an avenue for identifying individuals vulnerable to stress using intrinsic brain function before stress as an indicator.","Zhou, Y.; He, Y.; Jin, Y.; Rong, B.; Zeidman, P.; Huang, H.; Feng, Y.; Cui, J.; Zhang, S.; Wang, Y.; Wang, G.; Xiang, Y.; Wang, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.26.21261160v1?rss=1,614

What I call ""the paradox of scientific advice""consists in that the two basic expectations from scientific advisory committees - neutrality and usefulness - are inherently in tension. To be useful, advisers must help governments set and attain their goals. Judgments about values and ends are necessary for useful advice, as are subjective judgments in the face of uncertainty and disagreement. This puts the committee in a double bind: if it tries to be more useful, it compromises the neutrality that is the source of its authority and legitimacy;if it tries to remain neutral, it sacrifices usefulness. I argue that this dilemma cannot be solved within the committee but that broader democratic scrutiny could mitigate its force.

Environmental humanists, anthropologists and historians have tried to address the challenge through analysis of the experiences, philosophies and memories of weather. Archaeology, commonly preoccupied by hard science approaches to climate change, has largely been absent from this conversation. Nevertheless, with its insights into material outcomes of human experiences and relations, it can become integral to the discussion of ‘weathering’ climate change and historicizing weather.

Many species are opportunistic pathogens, and can harbour diverse classes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. K. pneumoniae is responsible for a high public-health burden, due in part to the rapid spread of health-care associated clones that are non-susceptible to carbapenems. Klebsiella thus represents a highly pertinent taxon for assessing the risk to public health posed by animal and environmental reservoirs. Here we report an analysis of 6548 samples and 3,482 genome sequences representing 15 Klebsiella species sampled over a 15-month period from a wide range of clinical, community, animal and environmental settings in and around the city of Pavia, in the northern Italian region of Lombardy. Despite carbapenem-resistant clones circulating at a high frequency in the hospitals, we find no genotypic or phenotypic evidence for non-susceptibility to carbapenems outside of the clinical environment. The non-random distribution of species and strains across sources point to ecological barriers that are likely to limit AMR transmission. Although we find evidence for occasional transmission between settings, hierarchical modelling and intervention analysis suggests that direct transmission from the multiple non-human (animal and environmental) sources included in our sample accounts for less than 1% of hospital disease, with the vast majority of clinical cases originating from other humans.","Thorpe, Harry; Booton, Ross; Kallonen, Teemu; Gibbon, Marjorie J.; Couto, Natacha; Passet, Virginie; Fernandez, Juan Sebastian Lopez; Rodrigues, Carla; Matthews, Louise; Mitchell, Sonia; Reeve, Richard; David, Sophia; Merla, Cristina; Corbella, Marta; Ferrari, Carolina; Comandatore, Francesco; Marone, Piero; Brisse, Sylvain; Sassera, Davide; Corander, Jukka; Feil, Edward J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.05.455249,614

The data were collected in two stages: at the first stage, there were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Russia, but no cases had yet been recorded in the Sverdlovsk region;at the second stage, the number of cases reached 1952 in the Sverdlovsk region and 221 344 throughout the country. The study used the word association tests, The Semantic Differential Scale (V.F. Petrenko), The Psychic Activation Assessment Methodology (L.A. Kurgan and T.A. Nemchin) and the questionnaire survey techniques. The findings showed that the significance of the coronavirus problem for the respondents varied in different periods of the pandemic. The core of the social representation is sustainable and coherent. It reflects the results of the media impact: death, panic. It also remains stable regardless of the time and involvement of the respondents in the pandemic. The potential alteration zone serves as a kind of 'taming' of knowledge about the coronavirus, the operationalization of the coronavirus perception content into the language of changes in a person's everyday life-the coronavirus pandemic is understood as a 'flu epidemic' and the need for self-isolation is a 'vacation', an opportunity 'to stay at home'. Observation of the immediate affective reaction of the respondents to the trigger 'coronavirus' uncovered the presence of emotional tension and the prevalence of negative experiences in them. The survey also showed that in the pandemic, being the main source of information and a means of communication, the media set trends for developing perceptions.

Political parties can also prevent people from voting. In this report, we review several methods to inject false alerts. One of them requires to corrupt the clock of the smartphone of the victim. For that, we build a time-traveling machine to be able to remotely set up the clock on a smartphone and experiment our attack. We show how easy this can be done.

The VIX, exchange rate, and gold returns had the most prominent influence on the S&P 500 returns in the market recovery.","Lento, Camillo Gradojevic Nikola",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070330,614
180053,Personal Accomplishment and Hardiness in Reducing Emergency Stress and Burnout among COVID-19 Emergency Workers,2020,"BodyThe 2020 coronavirus pandemic sparked sudden change in all spheres of life, not least health services. Across Europe clinical research had to adapt. The virus peaked in different places at different times, with London’s first wave in March-May. The National Institute for Health Research paused all face to face research at NHS and social care sites except for nationally prioritised Urgent Public Health (UHP) Covid-19 studies. The first UPH studies focused on acute Covid-19, largely in physical health settings. Research leaders quickly highlighted the need for high quality research data on the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of the general population, as well as the mental health and neuropsychiatric effects of the virus itself, to allow for the development and evaluation of mitigation strategies. The major UK research funders have resourced this. Once the first wave abated, paused research was restarted according to national prioritisation guidance. In Maudsley we worked closely with research teams to develop strategies to make our research programmes as Covid-19 adaptive as possible, maximising remote interaction with research participants, with robust infection prevention procedures if face to face meetings were necessary. Examples of innovative strategies will be shared. In January 2021 with the more transmissible variant of SARS CoV2, face to face research paused again, except where risk was outweighed by patient benefit in continuing. As patients benefit hugely from research and innovation and have better outcomes if treated in ‘research-active’ hospitals, maintaining access to research opportunities without increasing risk of contracting Covid-19 will be key in coming months.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Gaughran, F.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.222,614
180335,How can medical schools improve students' perceptions towards e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic?,2021,"• Develop a within-growing season yield forecast system with random forest model. • Random forest model performs well in predicting grain yield in China. • We identified the most important stage-specific predictors determining crop yield. • The most important variable influencing yields varied with crop types. Accurate and timely crop yield forecasts can provide essential information to make conclusive agricultural policies and to conduct investments. Recent studies have used different machine learning techniques to develop such yield forecast systems for single crops at regional scales. However, no study has used multiple sources of environmental predictors (climate, soil, and vegetation) to forecast yields for three major crops in China. In this study, we adopted 7-year observed crop yield data (2013–2019) for three major grain crops (wheat, maize, and rice) across China, and three major data sets including climate, vegetation indices, and soil properties were used to develop a dynamic yield forecasting system based on the random forest (RF) model. The RF model showed good performance for estimating yields of all three crops with correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.75 and normalized root means square errors (nRMSE) lower than 18.0%. Our results also showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at one to three months prior to harvest. The optimum lead time for yield forecasting depended on crop types. In addition, we found the major predictors influencing crop yield varied between crops. In general, solar radiation and vegetation indices (especially during jointing to milk development stages) were identified as the main predictor for winter wheat;vegetation indices (throughout the growing season) and drought (especially during emergence to tasseling stages) were the most important predictors for spring maize;soil moisture (throughout the growing season) was the dominant predictor for summer maize, late rice, and mid rice;precipitation (especially during booting to heading stages) was the main predictor for early rice. Our study provides insights into practical crop yield forecasting and the understanding of yield response to environmental conditions at a large scale across China. The methods undertaken in this research can be easily implemented in other countries with available information on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions.

180893,Assessement of a structured technological support intervention on uptake of video consultations,2021,"Background Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma mansoni, is of great significance to public health in sub-Saharan Africa. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), information on the burden of S. mansoni infection is scarce, which hinders the implementation of adequate control measures. We assessed the geographical distribution of S. mansoni infection across Ituri province in north-eastern DRC and determined the prevailing risk factors. Methods / Principal Findings Two province-wide community-based studies were conducted. First, in 2016, a geographical distribution study was carried out in 46 randomly selected villages, covering 12 of the 36 health districts across Ituri. Second, in 2017, an in-depth study was conducted in 12 purposively-selected villages, across six health districts. In each study village, households were randomly selected and members, aged one year and older and present on the survey day, were enrolled. In 2016, one stool sample was collected per participant, while in 2017, several samples were collected per participant. S. mansoni eggs were detected using the Kato-Katz technique. The 2017 study also incorporated a point-of-care circulating cathodic S. mansoni antigen (POC-CCA) urine test. Household and individual questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural and knowledge risk factors. The 2016 study included 2,131 participants, 40.0% of whom had S. mansoni infections. Infection prevalence in the villages ranged from 0 to 90.2%. The 2017 study included 707 participants, of whom 73.1% tested positive for S. mansoni. Infection prevalence ranged from 52.8 to 95.0 % across the health districts visited. In general, infection prevalence increased from north to south and from west to east. Exposure to the waters of Lake Albert and the village altitude above sea level were associated with the distribution. Both men and women had the same infection risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.76). Infection prevalence and intensity peaked in the age groups between 10 and 29 years. Preschool children were highly infected (62.3%). Key risk factors were poor housing structure (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.02-4.35), close proximity to water bodies (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.1-2.49), long-term residence in a community (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11-1.79), lack of latrine in the household (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.11-3.60), and swimming (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.20-5.32) and washing (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.78) in local water bodies. A family history of schistosomiasis (OR 0.52, 95%, 95% CI 0.29-0.94) and knowledge of praziquantel treatment (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16-0.69) were protective risk factors, while prevention knowledge (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.36-4.08) was associated with increased infection risk. Conclusions/Significance: Our results confirm high endemicity of S. mansoni in Ituri province, DRC. Both the prevalence and intensity of infection, and its relationship with the prevailing socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioural risk factors indicate intense exposure and alarming transmission levels. The study findings warrant control interventions that pay particular attention to high-risk communities and population groups, including preschool children.","Hunziker, P.; nigo, m. m.; Odermatt, P.; Battegay, M.; Beugelaaar, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.10.20171090v1?rss=1,614
181017,Keep calm and carry on during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Introduction: Music and dance are increasingly used as adjunctive arts-in-health interventions in high-income settings, with a growing body of research suggesting biopsychosocial benefits. Such low-cost, low-resource interventions may have application in low-resource settings such as Uganda. However, research on perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals regarding such approaches is lacking. Methods We delivered taster music and dance for chronic respiratory disease (CRD) sessions to patients and healthcare professionals. We then conducted an exploratory qualitative study, using thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the healthcare professionals and patients regarding i) the role of music and dance in Ugandan life and ii) the perceived acceptability and feasibility of using music and dance in CRD management in Uganda. Results Eleven patients with long-term respiratory conditions and eight healthcare professionals were interviewed after selection by purposeful convenience sampling. Four key themes were identified from (interview) analysis: Music and dance: 1) were central components of daily life; 2) had an established role supporting health and wellbeing; 3) had strong therapeutic potential in respiratory disease management; 4) the importance of modulating demographic considerations of culture and religion, and age. Conclusion Music and dance are central to life in Uganda, with established roles supporting health and wellbeing. These roles could be built on in the development of music and dance interventions as adjuncts to established components of CRD disease management like pulmonary rehabilitation. Through consideration of key contextual factors, and co-development and adaptation of interventions, such approaches are likely to be well received.","Philip, K. E. J.; Cartwright, L.

The quantitative method used in this study was applied to start-up companies in Greater Jakarta with a population of 522 start-ups. The sampling method in this study used a purposive sampling technique. Questionnaires were distributed using google form as many as 522 questionnaires, 200 questionnaires were returned. From the returned questionnaires, after sorting the completeness and fulfilling the requirements for testing, 187 questionnaires were obtained consisting of the founders. Primary data were collected through a questionnaire and then analyzed using statistical analysis methods using Partial Least Square SmartPLS version 3 program. The partial least square analysis results show that each of the factors: agility, entrepreneurship capability, business transformation and opportunity have a significant effect in increasing start-up behavior in Jabodetabek. This finding explains that in building a start-up, the founder must possess the agility entrepreneurship capability factor while still following business transformation and opportunities in developing the business. This study also found that the opportunity factor is the most dominant factor in increasing the start-up behavior of founders. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

181199,Target Groups for a Short Dexamethasone Course among Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients,2021,"The effects of baricitinib, a selective reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and 2, in the treatment of COVID-19 are associated with different aspects of pathogenesis - inhibition of viral endocytosis, reduction of excessive inflammatory response, and mitigation of vascular and pulmonary damage, which is a strong rationale for using baricitinib to treat patients with COVID-19. In the period from April to May 2020, City Clinical Hospital No. 52 obtained clinical experience of baricitinib clinical use in the therapy of 113 patients with COVID-19:58 (51%) women and 55 (49%) men, whose average age was 57±12.6 years old. Analysis of the results of using baricitinib showed that therapy with baricitinib against the background of standard pathogenetic therapy was found to be effective in 95 (84%) patients and ineffective in 18 (16%). Significant positive changes were shown in comparison with the baseline level of the following indicators: body temperature (from 37.2+0.8°C to 36, ±0.68°C, P=0.000), blood oxygen saturation (from 95.5±3.0% to 96.5±2.2%, P=0.011), C-reactive protein (from 46.1±48.0 mg/L to 33.5±43.7 mg/L, P=0.010), National Early Warning Score (NEWS) (from 1.7±1.3 to 1.1±1.2, p=0.001).From the safety point of view, patients showed a slight decrease in the average value of the number of neutrophils - from (3.1±1.4)xl09 to (3.0±2.0)xl09 and lymphocytes - from (1.8±0,9) x 109 to (1.7±0.9) x 109, as well as minimal multidirectional changes in the mean values of transaminase activity - alanine aminotransferase changed from 33.9±23.6 U/L to 34.9±47.5 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase - from 40.6±49.0 U/L to 38.5±25.5 U/L.

From there, viral genomes from all over the world have followed at an outstanding rate, reaching already more than 105 on early May 2020, and more than 106 by early March 2021. Phylodynamics methods have been designed in recent years to process such datasets and infer population dynamics and sampling intensities in the past. However, the unprecedented scale of the SARS-CoV-2 dataset now calls for new methodological developments, relying e.g. on simplifying assumptions of the mutation process. In this article, I build on the infinite alleles model stemming from the field of population genetics to develop a new Bayesian statistical method allowing the joint reconstruction of the outbreak’s effective population sizes and sampling intensities through time. This relies on prior conjugacy properties that prove useful both to develop a Gibbs sampler and to gain intuition on the way different parameters of the model are linked and inferred. I finally illustrate the use of this method on SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced during the first wave of the outbreak in four distinct European countries, thus offering a new perspective on the evolution of the sampling intensity through time in these countries from genetic data only.","Manceau, Marc",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.21.452479,614

For this specific population, evidence-based vaccination strategies are lacking. Here, we investigated humoral and cell mediated immune responses to SARS-CoV2 mRNA-based vaccines in patients receiving CD20-B-cell depleting agents for autoimmune disease, malignancy, or transplantation. Methods Patients at the Bern University Hospital with a treatment history of anti-CD20 depleting agents (rituximab or ocrelizumab) were enrolled for analysis of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (by IFN-g release assay) after completing vaccination against SARS-CoV2. Primary outcome was the the anti-spike antibody response in anti-CD20-treated patients (n=96) in comparison to immunocompetent controls (n=29). Results Anti-spike IgG antibodies were detected in 49% of patients 1.79 months after the second vaccine dose (interquartile range, IQR: 1.16-2.48) compared to 100% of controls (p<0.001). SARS-CoV2 specific interferon-g; release was detected in 17% of patients and 86% of healthy controls (p<0.001). Only 5% of patients, but 86% of healthy controls showed positive reactions in both assays, respectively (p<0.001).

183028,Dental medicine and COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-11,"Introduction and objectives: In the context of COVID-19, the World Health Organization has recommended the use of extemporaneously prepared bleach solutions of 1 g/L, as a conservative concentration able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and the vast majority of other pathogens that may be present in the healthcare setting. Consequently, there is a renewed interest in conducting stability studies of these solutions. The goal of this work was to verify the available chlorine concentration in several bleach solutions trademarks and to propose a beyond use date for 1 g/L bleach solutions, obtained after dilution with drinking water from different sources. Methods: Bleach trademarks, with nominal concentrations between 25-60 g/L, were subjected to iodometric titration to determine the available chlorine concentration. One trademark was used to prepare 1 g/L dilutions using water from different purification plants in Córdoba, Argentina. The samples were stored at room-temperature, both exposed or protected from light. The available chlorine concentration was determined by titration at preestablished time intervals. The beyond use date was reached when the available chlorine concentration dropped below 90 % of its initial. Results: The concentration of active chlorine in the different trademark bleaches was within the values established by current regulations. Diluted solutions protected from light showed a decrease of less than 10 % in active chlorine concentration during the first 10 days of assay. However, one sample exceeded the acceptance limit after 14 days. In contrast, in the samples exposed to light, the concentration of active chlorine dropped to 96.4 % at 24 hours and 79.3 % after 48 hours. No differences related to drinking water sources were observed. Conclusions: Compliance of the nominal available chlorine concentration in trademark bleach solutions was confirmed. Regardless the water source used for dilution, 1 g/L bleach solutions were stable for 10 days when stored at room temperature and protected from light. Instead, solutions exposed to light maintain their available chlorine concentration for only 24 hours.","Gavelli, M. E.; Giacobbe, L. C. L.; Fierro, C. B.; Olivera, M.

Genetic and pharmacologic studies have previously established a pathologic role for ATX and LPA signalling in pulmonary injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Here, increased ENPP2 mRNA levels were detected in immune cells from nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 patients, and increased ATX serum levels were found in severe COVID-19 patients. ATX serum levels correlated with the corresponding increased serum levels of IL-6 and endothelial damage biomarkers, suggesting an interplay of the ATX/LPA axis with hyperinflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction in COVID-19. Accordingly, dexamethasone (Dex) treatment of mechanically ventilated patients reduced ATX levels, as shown in two independent cohorts, indicating that the therapeutic benefits of Dex include the suppression of ATX. Moreover, large scale analysis of multiple single cell RNAseq datasets revealed the expression landscape of ENPP2 in COVID-19 and further suggested a role for ATX in the homeostasis of dendritic cells, that exhibit both numerical and functional deficits in COVID-19. Therefore, ATX has likely a multifunctional role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, worth of suggesting that its pharmacological targeting might represent an additional therapeutic option.","Nikitopoulou, I.; Fanidis, D.; Ntatsoulis, K.; Moulos, P.; Mpekoulis, G.; Evangelidou, M.; Dimakopoulou, V.; Vassiliou, A.

We find that the different models produce very similar patterns of weekly excess deaths but disagree substantially on the level of excess. While the exact country ranking along percent excess death in 2020 is sensitive to the choice of model the top and bottom ranks are robustly identified. On the country level, the 5-year average death rate model tends to produce the lowest excess death estimates, whereas high excess deaths are produced by the popular 5-year average death count and Euromomo-style Serfling models.

We also investigate the adaptation of well-established cross-section data derived from radiation interactions with water to the interactions involving the components of a virion, going beyond the density-scaling approximation developed previously. We conclude that solving one of the grand challenges of structural biology — the determination of RNA tertiary/quaternary structure — is intimately linked to predicting ion-beam inactivation of viruses and that the two problems can be mutually informative. Indeed, our simulations show that fast ion beams have a key role to play in elucidating RNA tertiary/quaternary structure.","Villagomez-Bernabe, B.; Chan, S. W.; Coulter, J. A.; Roseman, A.

AMI can be used for defence against a wide variety of biological weapons, and passive antibody (Ab) therapy has the potential to provide immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. Recent advances in the Ab field make it possible to generate Abs with enhanced antimicrobial functions. There are significant gaps in our understanding of Ab function, such that the development of Ab-based strategies remains a largely empirical exercise. Nevertheless, the advantages inherent in the therapeutic and prophylactic use of AMI provide a powerful rationale for continued development that will undoubtedly yield many new vaccines and therapeutic Abs.","Casadevall, Arturo; Pirofski, Liise-anne",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16197341/,614

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: Forty-two medical students and thirty-eight PhD students of O.Bogomolets National medical university were randomly chosen for the study. Students' knowledge of English was initially "" live"" assessed in February, online assessments were held in April and May, concluded with the credit final assessment. Upon passing the final test the students were asked to fill in the questionnaire containing the following items: satisfaction with the distance learning, level of the distance learning hardness, comparison of distance learning by quality and understanding, choosing the best sections for the English distance learning, level of technical problems. RESULTS Results: All students during the 2020 distance learning have improved their English language level: the medical students from 3.8 to 3.99, the PhD students- from 4.36 to 4.56. The questioning of both groups showed significant dissatisfaction of medical students ( 52-57% by different positions) with the distance learning. The PhD students showed higher satisfaction level (76-86% by different positions). CONCLUSION Conclusions: The assessed groups of the O.Bogomolets National medical university improved their English knowledge level during the distance learning. The authors relate significant dissatisfaction of medical students with the distance learning to their low motivation and learning maturity. The PhD students' higher satisfaction level may be related to the wider variability of the issues to study. The problem of distance learning of both medical and PhD students should be studied more thoroughly.","Lymar, Lesya; Storozhuk, Khrystyna",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34537751/,614

It spread around the world through an outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Patients were reported in 29 countries, and around 800 people died, although a majority of these cases were in Asian countries. Within a month after the virus that causes SARS was isolated, its entire genome sequence became available. The result is the acknowledgement of a novel coronavirus, now called SARS coronavirus (SCoV), that is different from other already known existing human and animal coronaviruses. Since a number of scientists from distinct fields have participated in the research on this emerging virus, a plenty of information has become available, and now SARS-CoV has become one of the best-studied members among coronaviruses. In this review, I would like describe on SCoV virology by comparison with other well-studied coronaviruses. It covers the taxonomy, structure of virion, viral genome and proteins, unique replication strategy, receptors and viral pathogenesis.

Analysis of 62 known B-cell epitopes located in five different proteins showed that they concentrated in IS sites with increased degree of information coordination. Based on the analysis of IS six peptides from two proteins were selected and produced in a recombinant form as yeast virus-like particles (VLPs). Immunization of mice with recombinant VLP-peptides has induced the production of IgG capable of recognizing full-length antigens. This result suggests that the analysis of IS of proteins can be useful in the selection of peptides possessing cryptic B-cell epitope activity.,"Alekseeva, Ludmila; Nekrasov, Aleksei; Marchenko, Aleksei; Shevchenko, Marina; Benevolenskii, Sergei; Sapozhnikov, Alexander; Kurup, Viswanath P; Svirshchevskaya, Elena",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16891044/,614

METHODS Between September 2001 and March 2008, 1040 patients underwent isolated CABG at our clinic. Nine hundred and eleven of these patients did not have any AF(Non-AF Group) and the other one hundred and twenty-nine had AF (AF Group). A retrospective study was performed for patient, disease and treatment related factors and multivariate analysis was used to identify independent clinical predictors of postoperative AF. RESULTS Postoperative AF was identified in 129 (12.4%) of the patients, and those were significantly older and had significantly higher additive EuroSCORE score as compared with patients without AF. During the postoperative course, patients with postoperative AF also had significantly higher and prolonged (≥6 hours) mechanical ventilation time, longer and prolonged intensive care unit stay and longer hospital stay. Logistic regression analysis revealed that postoperative AF development ratio was 1.690 times higher when the ventilation time was over 6 hours (OR 1.690, 95% CI 1.092-2.615, p = 0.018); 1.240 times higher in the presence of elevated additive EuroSCORE score (OR 1.240, 95% CI1.109-1.385, p = 0.0001); 1.052 times higher in the presence of advanced age (OR 1.052,95% CI 1.031-1.0741, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION Analysis of our data reveals that, patient's age, additive EuroSCORE score, and prolonged ventilation are predictors of postoperative AF. Identification of risk factors might lead to better prevention of this problem and its potential consequences. However, to support our investigation and obtain more reliable evidence, prospective randomized controlled trials are needed.","Erdil, Nevzat; Gedik, Ender; Donmez, Koksal; Erdil, Feray; Aldemir, Mustafa; Battaloglu, Bektas; Yologlu, Saim",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23445806/,614
189568,Resuscitating Dentistry: A Challenge in Covid 19 Pandemic.,2020,"More than 200 of the documented zoonoses represent a high proportion of the infectious diseases that cause cases of morbidity and mortality and almost 75% are emerging infections. Immigration and tourism are human activities that are included in the broader field of human migration and travel. Travel plays a significant role in the emergence and spread of disease. The migration of humans has provided the route of spread for infectious diseases and zoonoses (for example, plague, yellow fever, monkey pox and severe acute respiratory syndrome). Tourism constitutes a small fraction of overall movements of humans but a point worthy of note is the number of international travellers has increased by more than 1 300% over the last 50 years. In addition, over 80 million people, mostly from developing countries, are legal or illegal immigrants. The consequences of travel extend beyond the traveller to the population visited and the ecosystem. Tourism and immigration may constitute an interface for mixing different genetic and ecological profiles, as well as cultural and social aspects, which is of particular interest in regard to zoonoses. Primary prevention, epidemiological surveillance and health education in the framework of intersectoral and international collaboration remain the cornerstone for response to and control of zoonoses in the context of tourism and immigration.","Mavroidi, Nikoletta",Veterinaria italiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20411492/,614

190932,[Collateral damage of COVID-19 pandemic in private healthcare centres of Argentina].,2020,Coronavirus proteins are translated from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs which have common 3' termini with unique 5' extensions. Evidence suggests that coronavirus mRNAs are generated by a mechanism of leader primed transcription. Leader RNA binds to consensus sequences upstream of each gene on full length negative strand viral RNA and transcription proceeds to the 5' end of the negative strand to produce the nested set of mRNAs. Even though this gives rise to polycistronic mRNA species only the 5' extension of each mRNA is translated to give the viral proteins. The leader RNA for TGEV is about 90 nucleotides long and contains the sequence which recognises the leader binding sites on the negative strand RNA. Evidence suggests that the length of the leader binding sequence may be involved in transcriptional control of individual mRNAs. In order to investigate this a virus specific mRNA isolation method was developed to measure the relative amounts of mRNAs synthesised during an infection of LLC-PK1 cells with TGEV (strain FS772/70). Thus the relative quantity of each mRNA can be determined and correlated with the variation in size of the leader binding site.,"Hiscox, J; Pocock, D H; Britton, P",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209778/,614

METHOD Description of the first COVID-19 cases with real-time RT-PCR-positive test, as well as evaluation of epidemiological measures, cumulative incidence, rate of transmission, and mortality and lethality rates during the first month of the epidemic. RESULTS Average age was 43 years, and 58 % were males; 44 % of initial cases were imported. Lethality in the population during the first month went from 1.08 to 3.97 per 100 cases; however, the trend is linear and similar to that observed in Europe.

In humans, the most dramatic consequences of influenza are associated with periodically occurring pandemics. Pandemics require the emergence of an antigenically novel virus to which the majority of the population lacks protective immunity. Historically, influenza A viruses from animals have contributed to the generation of human pandemic viruses and they may do so again in the future. It is, therefore, critical to understand the epidemiological and molecular mechanisms that allow influenza A viruses to cross species barriers. This review summarizes the current knowledge of influenza ecology, and the viral factors that are thought to determine influenza A virus species specificity.","Landolt, Gabriele A; Olsen, Christopher W",Animal health research reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17692139/,614

The secondary objectives were 1) to compare the MLUS and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), as well as the combination of both scores, as predictors of severity according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement; and 2) to compare severity assessed by ultrasound scoring to severity assessed by lung computed tomography (CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS Multicenter prospective observational cohort study conducted from March 30 to April 30, 2020, in 2 university hospitals. Adult patients with dyspnea due to COVID-19 were included. An initial lung ultrasound was performed, and the results of MLUS, NEW2, and lung CT evaluations were recorded. Patients were classified by risk according to the WHO scale at 48 hours, as follows: low risk (score less than 5) or high risk (score of 5 or more). RESULTS A total of 100 patients were included: 35 (35%) were classified as low risk and 65 (65%) as high risk. The correlation between the MLUS and WHO assessments was positive and very high (Spearman rank correlation 􀁕 = 0.832; P .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the MLUS, NEW2 and combined ultrasound scores, in relation to prediction of risk classification were, respectively, 0.96 (0.93-0.99), 0.89 (0.82-0.95) and 0.98 (0.96-1.0).

METHODS Special antibody titer to SARS-CoV of 14 patients from 5 different families and their 10 kinfolks continuously tested by IFA and antigen-capturing ELISA methods. Samples were taken in the 1(st) - 7(th) year periods after SARS patients infected by SARS-CoV, being diluted and measured on it titers of three kinds of antibodies. Immunochemical staining with monoclonal antibody (mAb) against N protein of SARS-CoV was used to determine the stomach and enteric tissues among 5 SARS patients with their nucleocapsid antibody titer ascended obviously after 1(st)-7(th) year. RESULTS When testing the IgG antibody titer of the 14 SARS patients by IFA method, the average titer was 1/71 (95%CI: 1/58 - 1/85) in the 1(st) year, but began to descend in the following years, and the IgG antibody of the most SARS patients disappeared in the 7(th) year. Regarding the IgM titer, it disappeared in most of the SARS patients 1 year later. The average value of nucleocapsid antibody titer was 1/146 (95%CI: 1/122 - 1/171) in the 1(st) year, and it descended as the IgG antibody titer did. In 5 cases, differences appeared. The nucleocapsid antibody titer was between 1/156 and 1/210 in 3 cases, and 2 cases were normal. Immunochemical staining with mAb against N protein of SARS-CoV was identified in the stomach and enteric tissues of 5 SARS patients with the nucleocapsid antibody titer increased significantly, 1(st)-7(th) year later. The five patients were detected by gastroscopy detection and cell immunohistochemistry test. 3 cases showed N protein antibody positive in the serum, and positive immunohistochemical expression in most of the cytoplasm in the gastric tissue mucous gland epithelial cells. 1 case also expressed in the intestinal tissue slurry columnar epithelium and interstitial cells. The other two cases showed negative on both serum N protein antibody and immunohistochemical expression. The biopsy results of the 5 patients were as follows: 1 case diagnosed as ""signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach and rectum multiple transfer"", 1 case of gastric polyp, 1 case of superficial antral gastritis and 2 cases were normal. CONCLUSION By testing the special IgG, IgM, nucleocapsid antibody to SARS-CoV of the 14 family clustering cases, we found that they all decreased in the 7(th) year, and most of them disappeared. The nucleocapsid antibody titer was related to pathogenetic condition. SARS-CoV was proved to be still present in stomach and enteric tissues of SARS patients with the nucleocapsid antibody titer increased significantly after the 7(th) year.","Shi, Yu-ling; Li, Lin-hai; Sun, Zhao-hui; Chen, Jian-yun; Liao, Yang; Zeng, Lan-lan; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Xiao-dong; Cao, Cheng",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21162846/,614

This testing method combines PCR chemistry with fluorescent probe detection of amplified product in the same reaction vessel. In general, both PCR and amplified product detection are completed in an hour or less, which is considerably faster than conventional PCR detection methods. Real-time PCR assays provide sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of conventional PCR combined with Southern blot analysis, and since amplification and detection steps are performed in the same closed vessel, the risk of releasing amplified nucleic acids into the environment is negligible.

Secondly, an initial ow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased. Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease. Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.","He, Guojun; Han, Yijiao; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Shen, Jifang; Li, Tong; Pu, Qibin; Chen, Aijun; Qi, Zhiyang; Sun, Lijun; Cai, Hongliu",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

(2) Average length of hospital stay was 16.9 days for the all 70 cases, and 16.8 days for the 11 cases without glucocorticoid treatment, without statistical significance (F = 1.018, P = 0.39). (3) The other 59 cases were administered with 40 mg to 640 mg of methylprednisolone daily. (4) Average hospital stay was 15 days for the 23 cases with lower dose of 40 mg to 80 mg methylprednisolone daily, 18.5 days for the 27 cases with medium dose of 120 mg to 240 mg daily, and 17.9 days for the nine cases with higher dose of 320 mg to 640 mg daily (F = 1.018, P = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS Earlier use of glucocorticoid therapy with suitable doses could alleviate their clinical symptoms, improve their clinical courses, and promote the absorbance of infiltration in their lungs on chest-X-ray films for the cases with SARS. However, current clinical data showed that glucocorticoid therapy could not shorten the length of hospitalization for the cases with SARS.","Meng, Qing-hua; Dong, Pei-ling; Guo, Yan-bin; Zhang, Ke; Liang, Lian-chun; Hou, Wei; Dong, Jin-ling",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12930669/,614

202683,Emergency conversion to telehealth in hospital-based psychiatric outpatient services: Strategy and early observations,2020,"Background: One of the drugs which is commonly used in diabetic patients is Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. Currently, the association between DPP-4 inhibitor and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcome is not yet established. This study aims to analyze the potential association between DPP-4 inhibitor and the composite poor outcome of COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until November 29th, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and DPP-4 inhibitor were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. Results: Our pooled analysis showed that DPP-4 inhibitor use was not associated with composite poor outcomes of COVID-19 [OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.93-1.28), p = 0.29, I 2 = 0%, random-effect modelling], and its subgroup which comprised of severe COVID-19 [OR 1.07 (95% CI 0.87-1.31), p = 0.54, I 2 = 0%, random-effect modelling], and mortality [OR 1.14 (95% CI 0.87-1.51), p = 0.35, I 2 = 8%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association was not influenced by age (p = 0.663), hypertension (p = 0.454), and admission blood glucose (p = 0.310). Subgroup analysis showed that the association was weaker in East Asian populations (OR 1.02) compared to European populations (OR 1.11). Conclusion: DPP-4 inhibitor in diabetic patients did not alter the outcomes from COVID-19. Our study suggest that the use of DPP-4 inhibitor in COVID-19 patients with diabetes may still be continued according to the patients' need.

Primary outcome of interest was reduction in mortality 30-days after enrollment.Results: Thirty-six patients were screened, five treated as first-dose-sentinels and rest randomized, while four patients were screen-failures. Two patients in Arm-A discontinued prior to receiving one complete infusion and were replaced. At end of 1-month, there were three deaths in Arm-B, and none in Arm-A (p = 0.0296; 95% CI = -0.3 [-0.61, -0.08]). At end of study, more patients in Arm-A had improved SpO2 without increasing FiO2 (p = 0.0296), improved PaO2 (p = 0.0296), and reduction in IL-6 (43 vs 212 pg/ml; p = 0.0296) and tumor necrotic factor-&#945; (9 vs 39 pg/ml; p = 0.0253) levels. Transient lymphopenia (Arm-A: 11 patients) and infusion reactions (7 patients) were commonly reported treatment-related safety events.Conclusion: Itolizumab is a promising, safe and effective immunomodulatory therapy for treatment of ARDS due to cytokine release in COVID-19 patients, with survival and recovery-benefit.","Kumar, Suresh; De Souza, Rosemarie; Nadkar, Milind; Guleria, Randeep; Trikha, Anjan; Joshi, Shashank R; Loganathan, Subramanian; Vaidyanathan, Sivakumar; Marwah, Ashwani; Athalye, Sandeep N",Expert Opin Biol Ther,,614
203539,Importance of infection control and continence management plans in assisted living communities during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Abstract Background Neurological manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being widely documented However, movement disorders in the setting of 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) have been a strikingly less discussed topic Objectives To summarize available pieces of evidence documenting de novo movement disorders in COVID-19 Methods We used the existing PRISMA consensus statement Data were collected from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to the 29th of January, 2021, using pre-specified searching strategies Results Twenty-two articles were selected for the qualitative synthesis Among these, a total of 52 patients with de novo movement disorders were reported Most of these had myoclonus, ataxia, tremor or a combination of these, while three had parkinsonism and one a functional disorder In general, they were managed successfully by intravenous immunoglobulin or steroids Some cases, primarily with myoclonus, could be ascribed to medication exposures, metabolic disturbances or severe hypoxia, meanwhile others to a post-or para-infectious immune-mediated mechanism SARS-CoV-2 could also invade the central nervous system, through vascular or retrograde axonal pathways, and cause movement disorders by two primary mechanisms Firstly, through the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, resulting in the imbalance of dopamine and norepinephrine;and secondly, the virus could cause cellular vacuolation, demyelination and gliosis, leading to encephalitis and associated movement disorders Conclusion De novo movement disorders are scantly reported in COVID-19 The links between SARS-CoV-2 and movement disorders are not yet established However, we should closely monitor COVID-19 survivors for the possibility of post-COVID movement disorders This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved","Ghosh, Ritwik Biswas Uttam Roy Dipayan Pandit Alak Lahiri Durjoy Ray Biman Kanti Benito-León Julián",Movement Disorders Clinical Practice,,614
203865,The impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms: a longitudinal study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) endorsed clinical frailty scale (CFS) to help with decision-making. However, this recommendation lacks an evidence basis and is controversial. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the dose-response relationship between CFS and mortality in COVID-19 patients, with a goal of supplementing the evidence of its use. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from several electronic databases up until 8 September 2020. We searched for studies investigating COVID-19 patients and reported both (1) CFS and its distribution (2) CFS and its association with mortality. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated death or non-survivor. The odds ratio (ORs) will be reported per 1% increase in CFS. The potential for a non-linear relationship based on ORs of each quantitative CFS was examined using restricted cubic splines with a three-knots model. RESULTS: There were a total of 3817 patients from seven studies. Mean age was 80.3 (SD 8.2), and 53% (48-58%) were males. The pooled prevalence for CFS 1-3 was 34% (32-36%), CFS 4-6 was 42% (40-45%), and CFS 7-9 was 23% (21-25%). Each 1-point increase in CFS was associated with 12% increase in mortality (OR 1.12 (1.04, 1.20), p = 0.003; I2: 77.3%). The dose-response relationship was linear (Pnon-linearity=0.116). The funnel-plot analysis was asymmetrical; Trim-and-fill analysis by the imputation of two studies on the left side resulted in OR of 1.10 [1.03, 1.19]. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that increase in CFS was associated with increase in mortality in a linear fashion.","Pranata, Raymond; Henrina, Joshua; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Lawrensia, Sherly; Yonas, Emir; Vania, Rachel; Huang, Ian; Lukito, Antonia Anna; Suastika, Ketut; Kuswardhani, R A Tuty; Setiati, Siti",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,614

204409,Erratum for: Strategies for daily operating room management of ambulatory surgery centers following resolution of the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In April 2020, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic and infection control measures, including requests to work from home and stay-at-home restrictions, were introduced. This study examined changes in smoking behavior during the COVID-19 state of emergency. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Osaka, Japan. To assess differences in smoking behavior among 5,120 current smokers, before and after the declaration of a state of emergency, prevalence ratios (PRs) for two outcomes, increased smoking and quitting smoking, were calculated using multivariable Poisson regression, adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: We found 32.1% increased the number of cigarettes smoked and 11.9% quit smoking. After adjustment for all variables, we found risk factors for COVID-19 (men and older age group) had both significantly higher PR for quitting smoking (men; PR=1.38(1.17-1.62), 65 years old+; PR=2.45(1.92-3.12)) and significantly lower PR of increased smoking (men; PR=0.85(0.78-0.93), 65 years old+; PR=0.38(0.29-0.49)). Additionally, respondents working from home or living alone had significantly higher PR for increased smoking (working from home; PR=1.29(1.17-1.41), living alone; PR=1.23(1.10-1.38)) and respondents who changed from cigarettes to heated tobacco products (HTPs) had significantly lower PR for quitting smoking (PR=0.15(0.04-0.58)). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest people who have high-risk factors for COVID-19 might change their smoking behavior for the better, while people who work from home or live alone might change their smoking behavior for the worse, during the COVID-19 state of emergency. Additionally, changing from smoking cigarettes to using HTPs makes smokers less likely to quit.","Koyama, Shihoko; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Okawa, Sumiyo; Kadobayashi, Takayoshi; Shirai, Hisaya; Nakatani, Takeshi; Miyashiro, Isao",J. epidemiol,,614

To sum up the efficiency of IFN-&#945; against COVID-19, we searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE, from the date of genesis to the 1st of October 2020. Discharge from hospital and virus clearance considered as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. We compared the aforementioned outcomes of patients treated with standard care protocol and the patients treated with IFN-&#945; in addition to standard care protocol. Out of 356 identified records, 14 studies were subjected for full-text screening. Finally, a systematic review was performed with inclusion of five studies. Majority of the participants were males (ranged from 43.50% to 90.0%). We found that time of viral clearance and polymerase chain reaction negative (days) in most studies were decreased in the INF-&#945; + standard care group. The mean days of virus's clearance in INF-&#945; group and standard group reported 27.3 and 32.43. Likewise, the average days of hospitalization was found also lower in INF-&#945; group (18.55 vs. 24.36).

There are three HNS systems available in Germany which differ in their technical details of the underlying comparable basic principle. For the unilateral HNS with respiratory sensing, several comparative studies, high-volume register analysis and long-term reports exist. The continuous HNS without respiratory sensing does not require a sleep endoscopy for indication. For the bilateral continuous HNS as the single partially implantable device, a feasibility study exists. For indication, the assessment of positive airway pressure failure by sleep medicine is crucial, and the decision for HNS should be made in discussion of other treatment options for at least moderate OSA. The implantation center holds primarily responsibility among the interdisciplinary sleep team and is primary contact for the patient in problems. This depicts why structural processes are required to secure outcome quality and minimize the complications. The aftercare of HNS patients can be provided interdisciplinary and by different medical institutions, whereat, minimal reporting standards to document outcome and usage are recommended.","Steffen, Armin; Heiser, Clemens; Galetke, Wolfgang; Herkenrath, Simon-Dominik; Maurer, Joachim T; Günther, Eck; Stuck, Boris A; Woehrle, Holger; Löhler, Jan; Randerath, Winfried",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,614

This is in perfect agreement with mean field theories being developed more than 60 years ago. Accordingly, it was a big surprise when several groups independently reported long-ranged attractive components in the pair potential () of equally charged colloids. This so-called (LCA) was only observed in thin sample cells while the pair-interaction in unconfined suspensions has been experimentally confirmed to be entirely repulsive. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts, LCA remains one of the most challenging mysteries in colloidal science. We experimentally reinvestigate the pair-potential () of charged colloidal particles with digital video microscopy and demonstrate that optical distortions in the particle's images lead to slightly erroneous particle positions. If not properly taken into account, this artefact pretends a minimum in () which was in the past misleadingly interpreted as LCA.

206679,Liver Care and Surveillance: The Global Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Objectives: Stroke is a disabling condition and a leading cause of premature deaths in Chile. Before the covid-19 outbreak, access to first-line and second-line treatments was scarce already. The covid-19 outbreak was pointed-out as responsible for decreasing general emergency care, stroke emergency care, and stroke-related death rates, and there is a need to quantify those effects. Methods: A retrospective time series analysis using national real-world data was performed. The data were extracted from the records of emergency care and the deaths database published by the Ministry of Health for 2016-2020, for the public and private sector. Time series of emergency care, stroke care, confirmed covid-19 cases, and deaths due to stroke were constructed and compared against the previous year and the average observed between 2016 and 2019 using ANOVA, followed by post-hoc paired t-tests. Heat maps and box-plots were generated to demonstrate the changes in the demand for emergency care. Results: Emergency care in Chile has diseased significantly (p&lt;0.001) since the first confirmed case (44% less during the covid-19 outbreak compared to 2019). Admissions for stroke decreased 18% and 7% compared to 2019 and 2016-2019 period. In 2020, in January and February, care for stroke increased 8% and 3%, respectively. In March, at the onset of confirmed cases, there was a decrease of 30% and 16% in emergency care and stroke care compared to the previous year. Stroke-related deaths decreased 17% in all types of stroke and 6% for ischemic stroke when compared to 2019. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that access to stroke care has fallen in Chile during the covid-19 outbreak. Future studies are needed to quantify the effects on disease burden due to the lack of interventions. Authorities shall bring this information into the design of future strategies to avoid unnecessary and harmful lack of access for groups at risk.","Paez, L.; Lenz, R.; Paredes, D.",Value in Health,,614

INTRODUCTION: Research shows that anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder are highly prevalent in people with substance use disorders and can worsen the treatment outcomes, increasing the risk of relapse and poor adherence. However, evidence from systematic reviews on the prevalence of these comorbidities in substance use treatment settings is limited. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants will be people seeking treatment for substance use. Studies will be included if they have investigated the prevalence of the comorbid substance use disorders with anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder in treatment settings. METHODS: Primary studies will be screened from the databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Embase, and from searches to source gray literature. Eligible cross-sectional and cohort studies published after 1994 with no language limits will be retrieved, and their methodological quality will be assessed. Data extraction will include study details, methods, and outcomes. Results will be described by narrative summary or, if studies are sufficiently similar, a meta-analysis will be performed. Prevalence data will be pooled for meta-analysis by a random effects model. The results will be presented graphically in a forest plot. Data heterogeneity will be statistically tested using &#967;2 and I2 tests. If substantial heterogeneity is detected, sources of heterogeneity will be explored by subgroup analysis and meta-regression, and results will be presented by a narrative summary.

Virus penyebab COVID-19 ini dinamakan SARS-CoV-2. Angka mortalitas yang disebabkan oleh SARS-COV-2 (3,8%), hal ini lebih rendah dari angka mortalitas yang disebabkan oleh infeksi coronavirus sebelumnya, yaitu SARS-COV (10%) dan MERS-COV (37,1%). Namun, angka penularan dari SARS-COV-2 jauh lebih tinggi, yaitu 10 kali lipat bersifat lebih infeksius. Hal ini dapat dijadikan sebagai penjelasan penyebab dari mewabahnya virus yang terjadi secara mendadak. Infeksi SARS-COV-2 terjadi melalui droplets, kontak dengan cairan tubuh pasien yang terinfeksi, benda-benda yang terkontaminasi. COVID-19 dapat menimbulkan tanda dan gejala yang bervariasi. (WHO-2019-nCOV) Infeksi ini dapat menyebabkan gejala ISPA ringan hingga berat bahkan sampai terjadi Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), sepsis dan syok septik.

Data has shown that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are prone to severe disease with COVID-19 and with increased mortality. Acute complications such as dehydration, starvation ketosis, ketoacidosis, and the increased risk of coagulopathy and thrombosis should be considered particularly during this pandemic period. Fasting during Ramadan this year and the COVID-19 pandemic is more challenging, not only for patients with T2DM but also for healthcare providers. We present healthcare providers with important aspects to consider during the COVID-19 pandemic for patients with T2DM who intend to fast during Ramadan and other fasting days.","Zaina, Adnan; Tarabeih, Walid; Abid, Ali; Kassem, Sameer",Isr Med Assoc J,,614

209422,Reduction in hospital admissions for COPD exacerbation during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"While the applications and demands of Machine learning (ML) systems in mental health are growing, there is little discussion nor consensus regarding a uniquely challenging aspect: building security methods and requirements into these ML systems, and keep the ML system usable for end-users. This question of usable security is very important, because the lack of consideration in either security or usability would hinder large-scale user adoption and active usage of ML systems in mental health applications. In this short paper, we introduce a framework of four pillars, and a set of desired properties which can be used to systematically guide and evaluate security-related designs, implementations, and deployments of ML systems for mental health. We aim to weave together threads from different domains, incorporate existing views, and propose new principles and requirements, in an effort to lay out a clear framework where criteria and expectations are established, and are used to make security mechanisms usable for end-users of those ML systems in mental health. Together with this framework, we present several concrete scenarios where different usable security cases and profiles in ML-systems in mental health applications are examined and evaluated.","Jiang, Helen; Senge, Erwen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07738v1.pdf,614

The embedding is based on a generalized graph Laplacian, whose eigenvectors compactly capture both network structure and neighborhood proximity in a single representation. The key idea is to transform the given graph into one whose weights measure the centrality of an edge by the fraction of the number of shortest paths that pass through that edge, and employ its spectral proprieties in the representation. Testing the resulting graph network representation shows significant improvement over the sate of the art in data analysis tasks including social networks and material science. We also test our method on node classification from the human-SARS CoV-2 protein-protein interactome.","Deutsch, Shay; Soatto, Stefano",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14441v1.pdf,614

An online questionnaire was utilised to gather data from 109 students enrolled in one of the universities in Indonesia. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the primary framework employed for analysis, in which system quality and e-learning experience were included as external constructs to seek out a much better model to improve the understanding of students' intention to adopt e-learning. An extended TAM model was developed and tested in this study. The model consists of six constructs: system quality, e-learning experience, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward use, and behavioural intention. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and SMART PLS 3.0 software were applied for data analysis. The findings informed that the proposed model has been succefully explained factors university students use of e-learning during the pandemic in Indonesia. It suggested that attitude toward e-learning use was the most prominent construct to predict university students' behavioural intention to use e-learning during the pandemic.

This timeframe includes the first national ""lockdown,"" the period of ""easing"" of restrictions, and the summer vacation period. Data were collected from n = 588 full-time employees, who provided baseline data on their personality traits in early December 2019, and then later provided data on perceived stressfulness of the COVID-19 pandemic at five time points, spanning six months. Consistent with expectations based on event and transition theories, results showed that, on average, perceived stressfulness declined between early April 2020 and early September 2020. Moreover, this effect was stronger between early April 2020 and early July 2020. Hypotheses based on the differential reactivity model of personality and stress were partially supported. Emotional stability was associated with lower, and extraversion associated with higher, average levels of perceived stressfulness. Finally, extraversion was associated with increases (i.e., positive trajectories) in perceived stressfulness between early April 2020 and early July 2020 and decreases (i.e., negative trajectories) in perceived stressfulness between early July 2020 and early September 2020.","Zacher, Hannes; Rudolph, Cort W",Pers Individ Dif,,614

Members of this taxon, which is made up of almost 200 described species, are common in terrestrial soils globally. Still, the alpha diversity is not well known in many areas, and new species are frequently recovered. The highest species richness is found in the tropics. Here, five new species are described from soil samples collected in Madagascar. These species-Cavenderia basinodulosa, C. canoespora, Heterostelium radiatum, H. versatile, and Raperostelium stabile-are described based on both morphological characteristics and molecular data, with sequence data from the rDNA small subunit (SSU). The five new species are morphologically disparate, ranging from relatively small, robust taxa such as R. stabile to taxa with variable morphologies such as the larger H. radiatum and H. versatile and the yellow-tinted and irregularly branched species C. canoespora and C. basinulosa. These new species, together with earlier work where 13 other species were described from the island, suggest that there is a range of genetically diverse and highly morphologically variable dictyostelid taxa occurring on Madagascar, suggesting biogeographic patterns even within these very small organisms.","Perrigo, Allison L; Vadell, Eduardo M; Cavender, James C; Landolt, John C; Liu, Pu; Stephenson, Steven L",Mycologia,,614

It is widely recognized that mass testing is an efficient way to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as aid in the development of informed policies for disease management. However, the current COVID-19 worldwide infection rates increased the demand for rapid and reliable screening of infection. We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated (H), heat-inactivated and pelleted (HC) samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). Then we compared the sensitivity of HC in a larger group of 196 COVID-19 positive samples. Our study suggests that HC samples show higher accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to direct H (89 % vs 83 % of the detection in RNA). The sensitivity of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the viral loads (as measured by qRT-PCR Ct levels). Altogether, all the data suggest that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct sample testing with qRT-PCR may help to significantly increase testing capacity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review is built on specific protocol, two independent reviewers, each focused on articles related to COVID-19 and infection control in dental clinics, while the third independent reviewer resolved any conflicting article of interest. RESULTS: Respiratory droplets are the main routes of transmission of COVID-19. The main symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test on respiratory tract specimens is the most commonly used technique to detect COVID19. Combined nose and throat swabs and rectal swab are recommended to avoid false results. Personal protective equipment and evaluation are essential for every patient before starting any dental treatment, and following the instructions for infection control to avoid the spread of COVID19. In dental office, suspected patient with COVID-19 or presence of symptoms such as losing sense of smell and taste, in these cases dental treatment, must be postponed for 14 days. Evaluation of patient body temperature, screening, and answering questions related to contact COVID19 are crucial to make the decision to start or delay dental treatment to avoid COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Strict infection control procedures should be recommended. Patients recovered recently from COVID-19 may have treatment deferred for 28 days from onset of symptoms to avoid cross-infection. Anti-restrictive valves dental handpieces should be used to avoid cross-infection of COVID-19.","Tarakji, B.; Nassani, M. Z.; Alali, F. M.; Alqhtani, N. R.; Nabhan, A. B.; Rafedah, A.

217381,Experience of frontline medical workers in COVID-19 quarantine points: a qualitative study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: A majority of studies evaluating the risk of vertical transmission and adverse outcomes in pregnancies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are mostly based on third-trimester infections. There is limited data available on pregnancy sequelae of maternal infection in the first or second trimester. STUDY DESIGN: We present a patient with monochorionic-diamniotic twins that develops coronavirus disease 2019 infection at 15 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy is further complicated by stage II twin-twin transfusion syndrome. She undergoes laser ablation, which is complicated by development of a subchorionic hematoma. The patient then develops Escherichia coli bacteremia, resulting in septic shock and preterm labor followed by previable delivery at 21 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid and placenta were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: This case of SARS-CoV-2 argues against transplacental transmission after a second-trimester infection but brings attention to the possible downstream complications that may arise following early infection. KEY POINTS: · Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not evident after a second-trimester infection.. · Antepartum coronavirus disease 2019 may cause vascular placental changes and placental insufficiency.. · SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a maternal hypercoagulable state with adverse perinatal outcomes..","Mok, Thalia; Contreras, Deisy; Chmait, Ramen H; Goldstein, Jeffrey; Pluym, Ilina D; Tabsh, Khalil; Aldrovandi, Grace; Afshar, Yalda",Am J Perinatol,,614

Methods: One week after the lockdown was announced, we conducted an anonymous online survey of the orthopaedic surgeons in India through social media platforms to assess the impact of the lockdown during COVID 19. The survey had a total of 13 questions with (3-5) options and was designed with an aim to understand the perception and the state of mind of the Orthopaedic surgeons in the lockdown situation. Results: The survey was completed by 611 orthopaedic surgeons from 140 cities in India. There were 22.5% orthopaedic surgeons who said that they were definitely stressed out, and 40.5% who said they were mildly stressed out. As the age decreased, the percentage of orthopaedic surgeons feeling ""definitely stressed out"" increased. Disruption of life-work balance and uncertainties regarding return to work were other strongly associated factors with the ""definitely stressed out"" group. Conclusion: The psychological impact of the lockdown during COVID 19 on orthopaedic surgeons may become a potential concern that will require addressal through open discussion.

218681,The challenge of laypeople cardio-pulmonary resuscitation training during and after COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to characterize COVID-19 content posted by users and disseminated via TikTok, a social media platform that has become known largely as an entertainment platform for viral video-sharing. We sought to capture how TikTok videos posted during the initial months of the COVID pandemic changed over time as cases accelerated. METHODS: This study is an observational analysis of sequential TikTok videos with #coronavirus from January to March 2020. Videos were independently coded to assess content (e.g., health relatedness, humor, fear, empathy), misinformation, and public sentiment. To assess engagement, we also codified how often videos were shared relative to their content. RESULTS: We coded 750 videos and approximately one in four videos tagged with #coronavirus featured health-related content such as featuring objects such as face masks, hand sanitizer, and other cleaning products. Most videos evoked ""humor/parody,"" whereas 15% and 6% evoked ""fear"" and ""empathy"", respectively. TikTok videos posted in March 2020 had the largest number of shares and comments compared with January and February 2020. The proportion of shares and comments for ""misleading and incorrect information"" featured in videos was lower in March than in January and February 2020. There was no statistical difference between the share and comment counts of videos coded as ""incorrect/incomplete"" and ""correct"" over the entire time period. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing readily available social media platforms, such as TikTok provides real-time insights into public views, frequency and types of misinformation, and norms toward COVID-19. Analyzing TikTok videos has the potential to be used to inform public health messaging and public health mitigation strategies.","Southwick, Lauren; Guntuku, Sharath C; Klinger, Elissa V; Seltzer, Emily; McCalpin, Haley J; Merchant, Raina M",J Adolesc Health,,614

Methods: Data were collected from key databases, including Scopus, Medline, Google Scholar, and CINAHL. Other platforms included WHO and FDA publications. The review’s literature search was guided by the WHO solidarity clinical trials for COVID-19 scope and trial-assessment parameters. Results: The findings indicate that the use of antiretroviral drugs as an early treatment for COVID-19 patients has been useful. It has reduced hospital time, hastened the clinical cure period, delayed and reduced the need for mechanical and invasive ventilation, and reduced mortality rates. The use of vitamins, minerals, and supplements has been linked to increased immunity and thus offering the body a fighting chance. Nevertheless, antibiotics do not correlate with improving patients’ wellbeing and are highly discouraged from the developed clinical trials. Conclusions: The review demonstrates the need for additional clinical trials with a randomized, extensive sample base and over a more extended period to examine the potential side effects of the medications administered. Critically, the findings underscore the need for vaccination as the only viable medication to limit the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread.","Al-Masaeed, Mahmoud Alghawanmeh Mohammad Al-Singlawi Ashraf Alsababha Rawan Alqudah Muhammad",Healthcare,,614

This study investigated whether there is an association between their prescription and the incidence of COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We conducted a propensity-score matched cohort study comparing the incidence of COVID-19 among patients with hypertension prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme I (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) to those treated with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in a large UK-based primary care database (The Health Improvement Network). We estimated crude incidence rates for confirmed/suspected COVID-19 in each drug exposure group. We used Cox proportional hazards models to produce adjusted hazard ratios for COVID-19. We assessed all-cause mortality as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: The incidence rate of COVID-19 among users of ACE inhibitors and CCBs was 9.3 per 1000 person-years (83 of 18,895 users [0.44%]) and 9.5 per 1000 person-years (85 of 18,895 [0.45%]), respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.92 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). The incidence rate among users of ARBs was 15.8 per 1000 person-years (79 out of 10,623 users [0.74%]). The adjusted hazard ratio was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.95). There were no significant associations between use of RAS inhibitors and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Use of ACE inhibitors was not associated with the risk of COVID-19 whereas use of ARBs was associated with a statistically non-significant increase compared to the use of CCBs. However, no significant associations were observed between prescription of either ACE inhibitors or ARBs and all-cause mortality.","Haroon, Shamil; Subramanian, Anuradhaa; Cooper, Jennifer; Anand, Astha; Gokhale, Krishna; Byne, Nathan; Dhalla, Samir; Acosta-Mena, Dionisio; Taverner, Thomas; Okoth, Kelvin; Wang, Jingya; Chandan, Joht Singh; Sainsbury, Christopher; Zemedikun, Dawit Tefra; Thomas, G Neil; Parekh, Dhruv; Marshall, Tom; Sapey, Elizabeth; Adderley, Nicola J; Nirantharakumar, Krishnarajah",BMC Infect Dis,,614

220040,"The COVID-19 pandemic and eating disorders in children, adolescents, and emerging adults: virtual care recommendations from the Canadian consensus panel during COVID-19 and beyond",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy of an online intervention for poor sleep in the context of an ongoing stressful major life event, by assessing if this intervention can reduce insomnia severity at short-term (one week post-intervention) and long-term (one and three months post-intervention) follow-up time points. It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet. A printed version of this leaflet has been successfully used in previous treatment studies, which have been conducted by our research group. Participants will be encouraged to download, save or print out this leaflet, which will be provided in PDF format. There will be no restrictions on use and participants will be encouraged to refer to this leaflet as often as they wish to. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control. The comparator is a wait-list control (i.e. where they will receive the intervention after a one month delay) group. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure will be insomnia severity, as measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallières, & Morin, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention and at one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include subjective mood, measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006)) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention, and one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Additionally, subjective sleep continuity, derived from sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012), will be compared pre and post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: This study will operate as a cluster randomised controlled trial. Good sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or a no-intervention group, with a 1:1 allocation. Poor sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or wait-list control group, with a 1:1 allocation. Randomisation will be conducted automatically using Qualtrics study software, where block sizes will be equal and randomisation will be computer-generated. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment. The outcomes will be assessed by a blinded investigator. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The minimum sample size is 60. A total of 30 poor sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or wait-list control group. A total of 30 good sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or no intervention group. TRIAL STATUS: Recruitment for this study has yet to start. It is anticipated that recruitment will begin in August 2020 and end in April 2022. The current study protocol is version 1.0 (20 July 2020) TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was prospectively registered in the ISRCTN registry (registration number ISRCTN43900695 , date of registration: 8 April 2020).

Nucleobase-bearing peptides (nucleopeptides) and pseudopeptides (PNAs) offer further interesting possibilities related to their nucleobase-decorated nature for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, thanks to their reported ability to target complementary DNA and RNA strands. In addition, these chimeric compounds are endowed with intriguing self-assembling properties, which are at the heart of their investigation as self-replicating materials in prebiotic chemistry, as well as their application as constituents of innovative drug delivery systems and, more generally, as novel nanomaterials to be employed in biomedicine.

It is yet unclear how effective those policies are on suppressing the mobility trend due to the lack of ground truth and large-scale dataset describing human mobility during the pandemic. This study uses real-world location-based service data collected from anonymized mobile devices to uncover mobility changes during COVID-19 and under the 'Stay-at-home' state orders in the U.S. The study measures human mobility with two important metrics: daily average number of trips per person and daily average person-miles traveled. The data-driven analysis and modeling attribute less than 5% of the reduction in the number of trips and person-miles traveled to the effect of the policy. The models developed in the study exhibit high prediction accuracy and can be applied to inform epidemics modeling with empirically verified mobility trends and to support time-sensitive decision-making processes.,"Xiong, Chenfeng; Hu, Songhua; Yang, Mofeng; Younes, Hannah N; Luo, Weiyu; Ghader, Sepehr; Zhang, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00667v2.pdf,614

The establishment of standardized RT-qPCR protocols for respiratory secretions testing, as well as sharing of specimens, data, and information became critical. Here, we investigate the analytical performance of two interim RT-qPCR protocols (Charité and Centers for Disease Control (CDC)) for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Analytical specificity, PCR amplification efficiency, analytical sensitivity (limit of detection), and cross-reactivity were evaluated using contrived samples. The on-going accuracy was evaluated by retrospective analysis of our test results database (real clinical samples). N1, E, and a modified version of RdRP assays presented adequate analytical specificity, amplification efficiency, and analytical sensitivity using contrived samples. The three assays were applied to all individuals who requested the SARS-CoV-2 molecular test assay in our laboratory and it was observed that N1 gave more positive results than E, and E gave more positive results than RdRP (modified). The RdRP and E were removed from the test and its final version, based on N1 assay only, was applied to 30,699 Brazilian individuals (from 19 February 2020 to 8 May 2020).

The 12 SNAP-2 diagnostic scales yielded reliable scores in both community (median &#969; value = .90) and psychiatric (median &#969; value = .92) samples. The 6-month temporal stability was adequate for all SNAP-2 diagnostic scales (median test-retest r-value = .84) in a subsample of the community-dwelling adults (n = 97). When we examined the correlations between the SNAP-2 diagnostic scales and the Five-Factor Model Rating Form trait scales among the community-dwelling adults, the double-entry intraclass correlation values (median ICCDE = .94) indicated a marked similarity between our correlation profiles and the correlation profiles that were reported in Samuel and Widiger (2008) meta-analysis. In our psychiatric-adult sample, the SNAP-2 diagnostic scales showed adequate convergent-validity coefficients (median r-value = .61) with criterion measures of DSM-IV axis II/DSM-5 Section II personality disorders (PDs). Finally, relative-weight analysis results showed that selected Personality Inventory for DSM-5 trait-scale scores explained a substantial amount of variance in SNAP-2 antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal PD scale scores (median R 2 value = .55). As a whole, our data suggest that the Italian SNAP-2 diagnostic scales have adequate reliability and construct validity in the Italian culture.

Baricitinib, a janus kinases inhibitor, can potentially suppress inflammatory cascades in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of high dose of baricitinib with its usual dose in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This prospective cohort study was conducted on 238 adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight milligram and 4 mg of baricitinib was given orally to 122 patients in the high dose (HD) group and 116 patients the usual dose (UD) group, respectively daily for 14 days, and clinical outcomes were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Blood oxygen saturation level was stabilized (&#8805;94% on room air) earlier in the HD group compared to the UD group [5 (IQR: 4-5)/8 (IQR: 6-9), P < 0.05]. Patients in the HD group required intensive care unit (ICU) and intubation supports more in the UD group than that in patients of the HD group [17.2%/9%, P < 0.05; 11.2%/4.1%, P > 0.05; N = 116/122, respectively].

225551,Children with Epilepsy in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Over the course of the COVID19 pandemic, global healthcare delivery has declined. Surgery is one of the most resource-intensive area of medicine; loss of surgical care has had untold health and economic consequences. Herein, we evaluate resource utilization, outcomes, and healthcare costs associated with unplanned surgery admissions during the height of the pandemic in 2020 versus the same period in 2019. METHODS: Retrospective analysis on patients &#8805;18 years admitted from the emergency department to General & Digestive and Gastrointestinal Surgery Services between February and May 2019 and 2020 at our center; clinical outcomes and unadjusted and adjusted per-person healthcare costs were analyzed. RESULTS: Consults and admissions to surgery declined between February and May 2020 by 37% and 19%, respectively, relative to the same period in 2019, with even greater relative decline during late March and early April. Time between onset of symptoms to diagnosis increased from 2±3 days 2019 to 5±22 days 2020 (P = 0.01). Overall hospital stay was two days less in 2020 (P = 0.19). Complications (Comprehensive Complication Index 10.3±23.7 2019 vs. 13.9±25.5 2020, P = 0.10) and mortality rates (3% vs. 4%, respectively, P = 0.58) did not vary. Mean unadjusted per-person costs for patients in the 2019 and 2020 cohorts were 5,886.72±12,576.33 and 5,287.62±7,220.16, respectively (P = 0.43). Following multivariate analysis, costs remained similar (4,656.89±390.53 2019 vs. 4,938.54±406.55 2020, P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare delivery and spending for unplanned general surgery admissions declined considerably due to COVID19. These results provide a small yet relevant illustration of clinical and economic ramifications of this healthcare crisis.","Hessheimer, Amelia J; Trapero-Bertran, Marta; Borin, Alex; Butori, Eugenia; Curell, Anna; Espinoza, Arlena Sofía; Jensen, Joaquín; Turrado, Víctor; Morales, Xavier; de Lacy, Antonio María; Fondevila, Constantino",PLoS One,,614

226757,Systematic Review of the Literature About the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lives of School Children,2020,"Initial Teacher Education (ITE) can be viewed as a formative space in professional teacher identity development. Practice plays a key role in shaping teacher identity, providing a window into the reality of school life, as well as nurturing professional autonomy. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, school life shifted suddenly and unrecognisably in March 2020. This paper focuses on the experiences of preservice teachers on an ITE programme (post-primary) in one Irish University during the period of sudden school closures. The data show the transition to be problematic, underscored by a chaotic pivot to virtual communication and a destabilising of the structures that normally provide consistency. Yet it also presented opportunities and responsibilities. We explore Victor Turner’s work to consider school placement as an ‘in between’ space for preservice teachers and to examine the extent to which sudden school closures heightened this sense of ‘in betweenness’. We argue that the pandemic and its lifting out of pervasive and predictable social structures, gave rise to a period of ‘anti-structure’. We view school closures as an example of anti-structure, which challenged preservice teachers’ identity formation yet also gave rise to ‘communitas’ through experimentation with different modes of being and doing. © 2021 The Author(s).

The Spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 mediate viral entry and are the main targets for neutralizing antibodies. Understanding the antibody response directed against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the development of vaccine, therapeutic, and public health interventions. Here, we perform a cross-sectional study on 106 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to evaluate humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Most infected individuals elicit anti-Spike antibodies within 2 weeks of the onset of symptoms. The levels of receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) persist over time, and the levels of anti-RBD IgM decrease after symptom resolution. Although most individuals develop neutralizing antibodies within 2 weeks of infection, the level of neutralizing activity is significantly decreased over time. Our results highlight the importance of studying the persistence of neutralizing activity upon natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Prévost, Jérémie; Gasser, Romain; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Richard, Jonathan; Duerr, Ralf; Laumaea, Annemarie; Anand, Sai Priya; Goyette, Guillaume; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Ding, Shilei; Medjahed, Halima; Lewin, Antoine; Perreault, Josée; Tremblay, Tony; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Gauthier, Nicolas; Carrier, Marc; Marcoux, Diane; Piché, Alain; Lavoie, Myriam; Benoit, Alexandre; Loungnarath, Vilayvong; Brochu, Gino; Haddad, Elie; Stacey, Hannah D; Miller, Matthew S; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J; Maule, Graham T Gould; Côté, Marceline; Therrien, Christian; Serhir, Bouchra; Bazin, Renée; Roger, Michel; Finzi, Andrés",Cell Rep Med,,614

Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. Due to COVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% have lost a job, internship, or job offer, and 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to COVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides; lower-income students are 55% more likely than their higher-income peers to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Finally, we show that the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.","Aucejo, Esteban M; French, Jacob; Araya, Maria Paola Ugalde; Zafar, Basit",J Public Econ,,614

Nonclinical safety, immunogenicity and efficacy studies were conducted in 4 animal species, using multiple dose levels (up to 108 PFU/animal) and various dosing regimens. There were no treatment related mortalities in any study, or any noticeable clinical signs. Compared to unvaccinated controls, hematology and biochemistry parameters were unremarkable and no adverse histopathological findings gave cause for safety concern in any of the studies. There was no viral shedding in urine, nor viral RNA detected in whole blood or serum samples 7 days post vaccination. The rVSV-{Delta}G-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine immune response gave rise to neutralizing antibodies, cellular immune response, and increased lymphocytic cellularity in the spleen germinal centers and regional lymph node. No evidence for neurovirulence was found in C57BL/6 immune competent mice or in highly sensitive IFNAR KO mice. Vaccine virus replication and distribution in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice showed a gradual clearance from the vaccination site with no vaccine virus recovered from the lungs. The rVSV-{Delta}G-SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine was well tolerated locally and systemically and elicited an effective immunogenic response up to the highest dose tested, supporting further clinical development.","Madar-Balakirski, Noa; Rosner, Amir; Melamed, Sharon; Politi, Boaz; Steiner, Michal; Tamir, Hadas; Ronen, Yfat Yahalom; Bar-David, Elad; Ben-Shmuel, Amir; Sittner, Assa; Glinert, Itai; Weiss, Shay; Bar-Haim, Erez; Cohen, Hila; Elia, Uri; Achdout, Hagit; Erez, Noam; Rotem, Shahar; Lazar, Shlomi; Nyska, Abraham; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Beth-Din, Adi; Levy, Haim; Paran, Nir; Israely, Tomer; Marcus, Hadar",,,614
231150,Clozapine and COVID-19,2020,"Coal fly ash (FA) supported Pd-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles (FA-Pd-Ag) were prepared by reducing Pd(II) and Ag(I) salts together onto the dispersed solid support in aqueous medium. Electron microscope analysis (FE-SEM, HRTEM) in combination with elemental mapping (EDS) suggests that the nanoparticles are well dispersed on fly ash with an average diameter of 6-8 nm. The powder XRD analysis indicates that alloying of the interface occurs between Pd and Ag nanoparticles in FA-Pd-Ag, while XPS reveals that charge transfer takes place between the Pd and Ag moieties that come into contact with each other. The FA-Pd-Ag in aqueous NaBH4 solution exhibits an efficient catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol into 4-aminophenol and follows pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics (kPd-Ag = 0.7176 min-1). The higher rate constant for FA-Pd-Ag compared to that for their monometallic analogues (FA-Pd (kPd = 0.5449 min-1)) and (FA-Ag (kAg = 0.5572 min-1)) as well as their physical mixture ((FA-Pd + FA-Ag) (kPd+Ag = 0.4075 min-1)) suggests the synergistic catalytic effect of the bimetallic system. Moreover, the present bimetallic nanocatalyst exhibits the highest normalized rate constant (KPd-Ag &#8776; 51 100 min-1 mmol-1) compared to the reported bimetallic Pd-Ag nanocatalysts.","Maity, Niladri; Sahoo, Anupam; Boddhula, Rajkumar; Chatterjee, Saurav; Patra, Srikanta; Panda, Binod Bihari",,,614

Specifically, human viruses are grouped into 21 families, including the family of coronaviruses (CoVs). In December 2019, in Wuhan, China, a new human CoV was identified, SARS-CoV-2. The first step of the infection mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 in the human host is adhesion, which occurs through the S glycoprotein that is found in diverse human organs. Another way through which SARS-CoV-2 could possibly attach to the host's cells is by means of the histo-blood group antigens. In this work, we have reviewed the mechanisms by which some viruses bind to the histo-blood group antigens, which could be related to the susceptibility of the individual and are dependent on the histo-blood group.","Cuéllar-Cruz, Mayra",Future Microbiol,,614

Lung microbiome, though neglected previously have received interest recently because of its association with several respiratory diseases and immunity. Lung microbiome can modify the risk and consequences of COVID-19 disease by activating an innate and adaptive immune response. In this review, we examine the current evidence on COVID-19 disease and lung microbiome, and how lung microbiome can affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcomes of this disease. To date there is no direct evidence from human or animal studies on the role of lung microbiome in modifying COVID-19 disease; however, related studies support that microbiome can play an essential role in developing immunity against viral infections. Future studies need to be undertaken to find the relationship between lung microbiome and COVID-19 disease.","Khatiwada, Saroj; Subedi, Astha",Hum. Microbiome J.,,614

234699,COVID-19 and Right to Die With Dignity: Time to Re-Evaluate Policies Over the Practice of Last Rites?,2020,"This paper provides an empirical insight into how geopolitical risks impact international tourism demand. An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non-stationarity, and cross-sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid-19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre-crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy-makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector.

This study was performed to determine the reference interval for urinary NAG activity (N-Acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosaminidase) in urine of healthy dogs of different breeds, ages and sexes. It was utilized an automated method for the determination of NAG activity standardized for dog urine samples. Through statistical analysis it was observed that NAG is positively correlated with the age of the animal and urine specific gravity but is not interfered by sex or weight. Based on the determination of urinary activity and after correcting the values for a 1,025 urine specific gravity was obtained an reference interval of X '= 3.62U/L±0.66U/L.(AU)","Tassini, Luiz Eduardo S; Leme, Fabiola O.

236903,Brain volumetric changes in the general population following the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has been declared as a global emergency by the World Health Organization which has mounted global pressure on the healthcare system. The design and development of rapid tests for the precise and early detection of infection are urgently needed to detect the disease and also for bulk screening of infected persons. The traditional drugs moderately control the symptoms, but so far, no specific drug has been discovered. The prime concern is to device novel tools for rapid and precise diagnosis, drug delivery, and effective therapies for coronavirus. In this context, nanotechnology offers novel ways to fight against COVID-19. AREA COVERED: This review includes the use of nanomaterials for the control of COVID-19. The tools for diagnosis of coronavirus, nano-based vaccines, and nanoparticles as a drug delivery system for the treatment of virus infection have been discussed. The toxicity issues related to nanoparticles have also been addressed. EXPERT OPINION: The research on nanotechnology-based diagnosis, drug delivery, and antiviral therapies is at a preliminary stage. The antiviral nanomedicine therapies are cost-effective and with high quality. Nanoparticles are a promising tool for prevention, diagnosis, antiviral drug delivery, and therapeutics, which may open up new avenues in the treatment of COVID-19.","Rai, Mahendra; Bonde, Shital; Yadav, Alka; Plekhanova, Yulia; Reshetilov, Anatoly; Gupta, Indarchand; Golinska, Patrycja; Pandit, Raksha; Ingle, Avinash P",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,614

Although several vaccines have recently reached the market, the development of specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is an important additional strategy in fighting the pandemic. One of the most promising pharmacological targets is the viral main protease (Mpro). Here, we present an optimized biochemical assay procedure for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We have comprehensively investigated the influence of different buffer components and conditions on the assay performance and characterized Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrates with a preference for 2-Abz/Tyr(3-NO2) FRET pairs. The substrates 2-AbzSAVLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH, a truncated version of the established DABCYL/EDANS FRET substrate, and 2-AbzVVTLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH are promising candidates for screening and inhibitor characterization. In the latter substrate, the incorporation of Val at position P5 improved the catalytic efficiency. Based on the obtained results, we present here a reproducible, reliable assay protocol using highly affordable buffer components.","Drazic, Tonko; Kühl, Nikos; Leuthold, Mila M; Behnam, Mira A M; Klein, Christian D",SLAS Discov,,614

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided a further evidence of the importance of gender medicine. The epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 data has highlighted the presence of multiple and important gender differences, with more unfavourable scenarios for the male gender. The mechanisms underlying these gender differences are varied (including socio-behavioral, immune and viral factors) and not yet fully clarified. A gender-based approach to clinical practice also in the context of this pandemic seems to be mandatory, as it could significantly contribute to health promotion by improving the effectiveness of diagnostic and/or therapeutic approaches and, therefore, leading to important benefits primarily for the patients but also for the sustainability of the National Health System.","Lodi, Elisa; Scavone, Alberto; Reggianini, Letizia; Modena, Maria Grazia",G Ital Cardiol (Rome),,614

The recent literature underscores the need to implement protocols for symptom control and the training of non-specialists by palliative care teams. AIM: The aim of the study was to describe a palliative care unit's consultation and assistance intervention at the request of an Infectious Diseases Unit during the COVID-19 pandemic, determining what changes needed to be made in delivering palliative care. DESIGN: This is a single holistic case study design using data triangulation, for example, audio recordings of team meetings and field notes. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted in the Palliative Care Unit of the AUSL-IRCCS hospital of Reggio Emilia, which has no designated beds, consulting with the Infectious Diseases Unit of the same hospital. RESULTS: A total of 9 physicians and 22 nurses of the Infectious Diseases Unit and two physicians of the Palliative Care Unit participated in the study.Our Palliative Care Unit developed a feasible 18-day multicomponent consultation intervention. Three macro themes were identified: (1) new answers to new needs, (2) symptom relief and decision-making process, and (3) educational and training issues. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of palliative care, some changes in usual care needed to be made. These included breaking bad news, patients' use of communication devices, the limited time available for the delivery of care, managing death necessarily only inside the hospital, and relationships with families.","Tanzi, S; Alquati, S; Martucci, G; De Panfilis, L",Palliat Med,,614

A multi-disciplinary study,2021,"ObjectivesTo calculate the rates of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related death among people with rare autoimmune rheumatic diseases (RAIRD) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England compared to the general population. MethodsWe used Hospital Episode Statistics to identify all people alive 01 March 2020 with ICD-10 codes for RAIRD from the whole population of England. We used linked national health records (demographic, death certificate, admissions and PCR testing data) to calculate rates of COVID-19 infection and death up to 31 July 2020. Our primary definition of COVID-19-related death was mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate. General population data from Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics were used for comparison. We also describe COVID-19-related hospital admissions and all-cause deaths. ResultsWe identified a cohort of 168,680 people with RAIRD, of whom 1874 (1.11%) had a positive COVID-19 PCR test. The age-standardised infection rate was 1.54 (95% CI 1.50-1.59) times higher than in the general population. 713 (0.42%) people with RAIRD died with COVID-19 on their death certificate and the age-sex-standardised mortality rate for COVID-19-related death was 2.41 (2.30 - 2.53) times higher than in the general population. There was no evidence of an increase in deaths from other causes in the RAIRD population. ConclusionsDuring the first wave of COVID-19 in England, people with RAIRD had a 54% increased risk of COVID-19 infection and more than twice the risk of COVID-19-related death compared to the general population. These increases were seen despite shielding policies. Key MessagesO_LIPeople with RAIRD were at increased risk of COVID-19 infection during the first wave.

RECENT FINDINGS: A number of new mutated genes have been recently detected being associated with LVHT. There are indications that microtubules changing cell polarity, the transcription factor Nkx2-5, and NOTCH-1 signaling are involved in the pathogenesis of LVHT. There are also indications that the PKC signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of gap junction intercellular communication, is disturbed in LVHT. LVHT is the same as LVNC and is associated with pathogenic variants in > 110 mtDNA or nDNA genes. LVHT has been also reported in > 15 chromosomal defects. However, a causal relation between any of these variants and LVHT has not been proven. There is no general agreement on the treatment of LVHT. According to expert opinions, LVHT patients require anticoagulation if they meet the criteria for anticoagulation or an ICD if they meet the appropriate criteria. Heart failure therapy is equal to patients with other causes of heart failure.","Finsterer, Josef; Stöllberger, Claudia",Curr Cardiol Rep,,614

On 18 September, the Ethiopian Minister of Health advised the Parliament the possibility of reopening schools provided certain conditions were met. Schools are currently reopening in the country for the first time since March 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the knowledge and preventive health behaviours toward COVID-19 and associated factors among secondary school students. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 370 secondary school students were included. Bivariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression model were fitted to identify the predictors of knowledge about COVID-19. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis were done to identify factors associated with preventive behaviour. A p<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: Only one-fourth (23.5%, 95% CI 19.5% to 28.1%) of the participants had a good knowledge about COVID-19. The mean score of preventive behaviour was 22.8±SD 6.2. Marital status, religion, father education, living arrangement and sources of information were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Being female and using health professionals as source of information increased the engagement in preventive behaviours. On the other hand, student whose father employed in non-governmental organisation and other jobs had decreased engagement in preventive health behaviours. CONCLUSION: Significant number of the students had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and poorly engaged in COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Thus, it is suggested to include and disseminate about COVID-19 in related academic sessions, using school clubs and minimedias. The sources of COVID-19-related information need to strengthen the dissemination of tailored, credible and timely message to enhance the knowledge and engagement of the students in preventive behaviours.","Handebo, Simegnew; Adugna, Asmamaw; Kassie, Ayenew; Shitu, Kegnie",BMJ Open,,614

Outside of this region, the Newton method has to be damped in order to ensure convergence. However, the available estimates of both the size of the convergence region and the step length to be used outside of it are based on conservative relations between the Hessians at different points and are hence sub-optimal. In this contribution we use methods of optimal control theory to compute the optimal step length of the Newton method on the class of self-concordant functions, as a function of the Newton decrement. With this step length quadratic convergence can be achieved on the whole Dikin ellipsoid. The exact bounds are expressed in terms of solutions of ordinary differential equations which cannot be integrated explicitly. As an application, the neighbourhood of the central path in which the iterates of short-step interior point methods for conic programming are required to stay can be enlarged, enabling faster progress along the central path during each iteration and hence fewer iterations to achieve a given accuracy.","Hildebrand, Roland",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08650v1.pdf,614

242602,Evidence of the psychological effects of pseudoscientific information about COVID-19 on rural and urban populations,2021,"BACKGROUND: Thailand is one of the most rapidly aging countries in Asia. Traditional family-based care, which has been the basis of most care for older people, is becoming unsustainable as families become smaller. In addition, women tend to be adversely affected as they still form the bulk of caregivers for older people, and many are likely to exit the labor market in order to provide care. Many family caregivers also have no or minimal training, and they may be called upon to provide quite complex care, increasing the proportion of older people receiving suboptimal care if they rely only on informal care that is provided by families and friends. Facing the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases and age-related morbidity, Thai communities are increasingly in need of community-integrated care models for older persons that can link existing health systems and reduce the burden upon caring families. This need is common to many countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of a community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) model to enhance family-based care for older people. METHODS: This paper describes a cluster randomized controlled trial comprised of 6 intervention clusters and 6 control clusters that aim to recruit 2000 participants in each arm. This research protocol has been approved by the World Health Organization Ethics Review Committee. The intervention clusters will receive an integrated model of care structured around (1) a community respite service, (2) the strengthening of family care capacity, and (3) an exercise program that aims to prevent entry into long-term care for older people. Control group clusters receive usual care (ie, the current system of long-term care common to all provinces in Thailand), consisting principally of a volunteer-assisted home care service. The trial will be conducted over a period of 2 years. The primary outcome is family caregiver burden measured at a 6-month follow-up, as measured by the Caregiver Burden Inventory. Secondary outcomes consist of biopsychosocial indicators including functional ability, as measured using an activity of daily living scale; depression, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale; and quality of life of older people, as measured by the EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-levels scale. Intention-to-treat analysis will be followed. RESULTS: The CIIC facility has been established. Community care prevention programs have been launched at the intervention clusters. Family caregivers are receiving training and assistance. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Since ASEAN and many Asian countries share similar traditional family-based, long-term care systems, the proposed CIIC model and the protocol for its implementation and evaluation may benefit other countries wishing to adopt similar community-integrated care models for older people at risk of needing long-term care.

However, previous studies have indicated possible cross-reactivity of these assays, including in malaria-endemic areas.Methods: We tested 213 well-characterized pre-pandemic samples from Nigeria using two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays: Abbott Architect IgG and Euroimmun NCP IgG assay, both targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. To assess antibody binding strength, an avidity assay was performed on these samples and on plasma from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive persons.Results: Thirteen (6.1%) of 212 samples run on the Abbott assay and 38 (17.8%) of 213 run on the Euroimmun assay were positive. Anti-Plasmodium IgG levels were significantly higher among false-positives for both Abbott and Euroimmun; no association was found with active P. falciparum infection. An avidity assay using various concentratIons of urea wash in the Euroimmun assay reduced loosely-bound IgG: of 37 positive/borderline pre-pandemic samples, 46%, 86%, 89%, and 97% became negative using 2M, 4M, 5M, and 8M urea washes, respectively. The wash slightly reduced avidity of antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients within 28 days of PCR confirmation; thereafter avidity increased for all urea concentrations except 8M.Conclusions: This validation found moderate to substantial cross-reactivity on two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays using samples from a malaria-endemic setting. A simple urea wash appeared to alleviate issues of cross-reactivity.","Steinhardt, Laura C; Ige, Fehintola; Iriemenam, Nnaemeka C; Greby, Stacie M; Hamada, Yohhei; Uwandu, Mabel; Aniedobe, Maureen; Stafford, Kristen A; Abimiku, Alash039; le,; Mba, Nwando; Agala, Ndidi; Okunoye, Olumide; Mpamugo, Augustine; Swaminathan, Mahesh; Onokevbagbe, Edewede; Olaleye, Temitope; Odoh, Ifeanyichukwu; Marston, Barbara J; Okoye, McPaul; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Rangaka, Molebogeng X; Rogier, Eric; Audu, Rosemary",J. clin. microbiol,,614

246065,How did chinese government implement unconventional measures against COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"This research aims to analyze the effects of pseudoscientific information (PI) about COVID-19 on the mental well-being of the general population. A total of 782 participants were classified according to the type of municipality in which they lived (rural municipalities and urban municipalities). The participants answered psychometric questionnaires that assessed psychological well-being, pseudoscientific beliefs and the ability to discriminate between scientific and pseudoscientific information about COVID-19. The results indicated the following: the greater the ability to discriminate between false information and true information, the greater the levels of psychological well-being perceived by the participant. The ability to discriminate predicts up to 32% of psychological well-being only for subjects living in rural municipalities. Residents in urban municipalities showed lower levels of well-being than residents in rural municipalities. It is concluded that new social resources are needed to help the general population of urban municipalities discriminate between pseudoscientific and scientific information.","Escolà-Gascón, Álex; Marín, Francesc-Xavier; Rusiñol, Jordi; Gallifa, Josep",Psychiatry Res,,614

246589,Family Caregivers' Experiences and Changes in Caregiving Tasks During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced health care systems to rethink the optimal delivery of health care services and has dramatically increased demand for general medicine providers (internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine), while simultaneously reducing demand for many subspecialty services. At Kaiser Permanente, we implemented a program wherein health care providers drawn from multiple disciplines perform daily telemedicine check-ins on COVID-19 patients, allowing us to both maintain social distancing and make use of providers in specialties who otherwise may have had lower in-clinic volumes. Methods: Kaiser Permanente patients testing positive for COVID-19 between March and October 2020 were referred to our program. Physicians and nurses (RNs) were invited to participate in our program and were trained using Microsoft Teams&#8482; meetings. Patients receive daily phone calls by a physician or RN. Select patients receive portable pulse oximeter devices based on standardized criteria incorporating age and comorbidities. When patients are determined to be clinically stable, they are discharged back to their primary care physician for ongoing management. Results: Descriptive results for the virtual home care program (VHCP) are reported through October 2020, though these results do not represent a planned statistical analysis. Forty-two percent of the patients were male, 43% were black, and 30% were Hispanic. The most common comorbidities of patients in our program were obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2; 35%), followed by hypertension (32%) and diabetes mellitus (19%). Then, 8.2% of patients ultimately required hospital admission. Mortality rate for patients in our program was 1.33%. Discussion: Our program was able to provide virtual care for thousands of COVID-19 positive Kaiser members in the Washington, DC, and Baltimore Metro regions. We did so by utilizing physicians and RNs from specialties experiencing a decrease in clinic volume attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The experiences of our program may be valuable to clinicians wishing to establish similar programs of their own.","Shaw, James G; Sankineni, Sandeep; Olaleye, Charles A; Johnson, Kari L; Locke, Jessica L; Patino, John; Sabi, Farzaneh L; McCarthy, Richard J",Telemed. j. e. health,,614

248120,The role of locoregional anesthesia in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Virtual fracture clinics are an alternative to the traditional model of fracture care. Since their introduction in 2011, they have become increasingly used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis has driven institutions to examine such innovative solutions to manage patient care. The current controversies include quantifying safety outcomes, such as potential delayed or missed injuries, inadequate treatment, and medicolegal claims. Questions also exist regarding the potential for cost reductions and efficiencies that may be achieved. Physical distancing has limited the number of face-to-face consultations, so this review was conducted to determine if virtual fracture clinics can provide an acceptable alternative in these challenging times. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The aim of this systematic review was to describe (1) adverse outcomes, (2) cost reductions, and (3) efficiencies associated with the virtual fracture clinic model. METHODS: A systematic review of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted from database inception to March 2020. The keywords ""virtual"" or ""telemedicine"" or ""telehealth"" or ""remote"" or ""electronic"" AND ""fracture"" or ""trauma"" or ""triage"" AND ""clinic"" or ""consultation"" were entered, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria included adults and children treated for injuries by a virtual clinic model at the initial review. Eligible injuries included injuries deemed to not need surgical intervention, and those able to be treated remotely using defined protocols. Exclusion criteria consisted of patients reviewed by telemedicine using video links or in person at the initial review. Initially, 1065 articles were identified, with 665 excluded as they did not relate to virtual fracture clinics. In all, 400 articles were screened for eligibility, and 27 full-text reviews were conducted on 18 studies (30,512 virtual fracture clinic encounters). Three subdomains focusing on adverse outcomes, cost reductions, and efficiencies were recorded. The term adverse outcomes was used to describe any complications, further surgeries, re-referrals back to the clinic, or deviations from the protocols. Efficiency described the number of patients reviewed and discharged using the model, savings in clinic slots, reduced waiting times, or a reduction in consumption of resources such as radiographs. All studies were observational and the quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa tool, which demonstrated a median score of 6 ± 1.8, indicating moderate quality. RESULTS: Six studies reported adverse outcomes in detail, with events ranging from inappropriate splinting, deviations from protocols, and one patient underwent an osteotomy for a malunion. Efficiency varied from direct discharge proportions of 18% in early studies to 100% once the virtual fracture clinic model was more established. Cost reductions compared with estimates derived from conventional fracture clinics varied from USD 53 to USD 297 and USD 39,125 to USD 305876 compared with traditional fracture clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual fracture clinics may provide a means to treat patients remotely, using agreed-upon protocols. They have an important role in the current COVID-19 pandemic, due to the possibility to provide ongoing care in an otherwise challenging setting. More robust studies looking at this model of care will be needed to assess its long-term effects on patients, institutions, and health care systems.

There are presently several research studies on the atmospheric environmental and economic effects of this dreaded virus. Supposedly, the responses ought to have also present innovations that would advance scientific research to mitigate its impacts since most of the ensuing consequences impact the atmospheric climatic conditions. Even when it appears that economic events would possibly return in no time, the circumstances will change. Specifically, from the existing literature, it appears that not much has been done to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on climate change. Hence, this present review article will explore the possible connection between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and climate change. The utilization of various scientific domains for climate change studies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and exploring the positive influences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and measures to avoid the negative impacts on climate change owing to SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed.","Ukhurebor, Kingsley Eghonghon; Singh, Kshitij Rb; Nayak, Vanya; Uk-Eghonghon, Gladys","Environ. sci., Process. impacts (Online)",,614

249266,Cardiac and Pulmonary Transplant Considerations During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"This article aims to analyse the implementation of public procurement procedures in the context of national governments' fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and find solutions for adapting those public procurement procedures that are currently used in the healthcare sector to new challenges. For this above purpose, we have applied both theoretical methods such as analysis, synthesis, generalization, and empirical methods such as observation, etc. The research has yielded the following findings: 1) there are no one-size-fits-all solutions in the national governments' fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through the public procurement mechanism, except that national policies in this field intend to speed up the organisation of the public procurement procedures, which would shorten the time for the delivery of medical goods to healthcare facilities;2) due to the current emergency conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, public procurements of medical supplies are taking place under the non-competitive procedure, i. e. with direct contracting of a specific vendor, which essentially increases corruption risks and allows for subjective decision making;3) amid the increased corruption risks, there is a need to assign high priority to strengthening the public control (monitoring), as well as the governmental control over medical procurements;4) saving of public funds as the underlying principle of some national public procurement systems becomes irrelevant in the face of such threats as the global COVID-19 pandemic;5) it is quite difficult to speak of another principle - effective use of public funds - because we are now dealing with an emergency and the actors (both the government and the expert community) lack understanding of how things might potentially develop in the future. Thus, the authors offer the following solutions: 1) create temporary specialized bodies, with the cross-agency powers, at the national and regional levels, that would take on such functions as: coordination of procurements;needs analysis of particular areas in medical supplies;management of potential vendors. These measures may help make medical procurements as effective as possible in these current conditions;2) develop special procedures (mechanisms), by national governments, for conducting checks of public procurements in the healthcare sector that are made as part of the response measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, because those check algorithms that are in place today cannot take into account the realities of this particular emergency situation and the conditions in which those procurements are made.","Ustymenko, V.; Soshnykov, A.; Tokarska, A.; Makarenko, O.; Nesterenko, K.",Georgian Med News,,614
249316,"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical, Psychological and Nutritional Characteristics of Elite Athletes: a Cross-Sectional Web Survey",2021,"Purpose: Due to the rapid surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in India, the health-care supply chain (HCSC) disruptions and uncertainties have increased manifold posing severe challenges to health-care facilities and significantly hampering the functioning of the health industry. This study aims to propose a hierarchical structural model of enablers of HCSC in the COVID-19 outbreak and identifies inter-relationships among them in the health-care market. Design/methodology/approach: Enablers of emergency HCSC have been identified through extensive literature review and experts’ opinions. Subsequently, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) and cross-impact matrix-multiplication (MICMAC) analysis have been implemented to determine the hierarchical inter-relationships among enablers and classify them according to their contribution to the overall system. Findings: The research has identified and validated 15 enablers of the emergency supply chain in health-care businesses. The study resulted in a seven-level hierarchical structural model based on enabler’s driving and dependence powers. Further, the application of MICMAC analysis resulted in the classification of enablers into four groups, namely, autonomous, dependent, linkage and independent group. Research limitations/implications: This study would help health professionals, policymakers and academia to implement the theoretical model constructed to alleviate the effect of COVID-19 by improving the HCSC performances in pandemic situations. This study has social and economic implications in terms of cost-effective and efficient delivery of care services in health emergencies. Originality/value: The proposed theoretical model constructed is a new effort addressing the issues of HCSC in the COVID-19 crisis. Procedural implementation of TISM and MICMAC analysis in this study would help researchers to grasp concepts in a very lucid manner. The present study is one of the very few studies analyzing enablers in pandemic situations by implementing the TISM approach. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hossain, M.

Although age is a major risk factor for outcome impairment in COVID-19, its impact on coagulative patterns here is still unclear. We investigated the association of Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) with thrombotic and haemorrhagic events according to different ages in patients admitted for COVID-19. A total of 27 patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia, without need for intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation at hospital presentation, and 24 controls with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively included. ETP levels were measured on admission. Patients were evaluated for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolism) and bleeding complications [according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definition] during in-hospital stay. COVID-19 patients had similar ETP levels compared to controls (AUC 93 ± 24% vs 99 ± 21%, p = 0.339). In the COVID-19 cohort, patients with in-hospital MACE showed lower ETP levels on admission vs those without (AUC 86 ± 14% vs 95 ± 27%, p = 0.041), whereas ETP values were comparable in patients with or without bleeding (AUC 82 ± 16% vs 95 ± 26%, p = 0.337). An interaction between age and ETP levels for both MACE and bleeding complications was observed, where a younger age was associated with an inverse relationship between ETP values and adverse event risk (pint 0.018 for MACE and 0.050 for bleeding). Patients with COVID-19 have similar thrombin potential on admission compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. In younger COVID-19 patients, lower ETP levels were associated with a higher risk of both MACE and bleeding.","Mennuni, Marco G; Rolla, Roberta; Grisafi, Leonardo; Spinoni, Enrico G; Rognoni, Andrea; Lio, Veronica; Castello, Luigi M; Sainaghi, Pier P; Pirisi, Mario; Avanzi, Gian Carlo; Krengli, Marco; Bellan, Mattia; Ferrante, Daniela; Aimaretti, Gianluca; Dianzani, Umberto; Patti, Giuseppe",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,614

We used 187 B.1.429 variant sequences from Hawai'i deposited in the GenBank and GISAID as of March 20, 2021, as an example to develop the methodology. Briefly, i) acquire sequences, ii) perform multiple sequence alignment, iii) trim the alignment, iv) remove incomplete sequences, v) remove duplicates, and vi) generate a phylogenetic tree. The tree defined the most recent common ancestor as the origin. Further, the multiple sequence alignment used to generate the phylogenetic tree identified 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the B.1.429 variant genome. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines B.1.429 as a variant initially found in California. This variant was introduced in Hawai'i multiple times in early 2021. Based on the phylogenetic tree, we conclude that the B.1.429 variant has entered Hawai'i at different timepoints from at least seven different states in the continental United States.

Subsequently, transfer learning was conducted using DenseNet169, InceptionResNetV2, and Xception to identify COVID-19 using open datasets (internal) and the KUAH dataset (external) with histogram matching. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used for the visualization of abnormal patterns in CXRs. The average AUC and accuracy of the multiscale and mixed-COVID-19Net using three CNNs over five folds were (0.99 ± 0.01 and 92.94% ± 0.45%), (0.99 ± 0.01 and 93.12% ± 0.23%), and (0.99 ± 0.01 and 93.57% ± 0.29%), respectively, using the open datasets (internal). Furthermore, these values were (0.75 and 74.14%), (0.72 and 68.97%), and (0.77 and 68.97%), respectively, for the best model among the fivefold cross-validation with the KUAH dataset (external) using domain adaptation. The various state-of-the-art models trained on open datasets show satisfactory performance for clinical interpretation. Furthermore, the domain adaptation for external datasets was found to be important for detecting COVID-19 as well as other diseases.","Cho, Yongwon; Hwang, Sung Ho; Oh, Yu-Whan; Ham, Byung-Joo; Kim, Min Ju; Park, Beom Jin",,,614

251172,Global Evidence on the Determinants of Public Trust in Governments during the COVID-19,2021,"Technology advancements have a rapid effect on every field of life, be it medical field or any other field. Artificial intelligence has shown the promising results in health care through its decision making by analysing the data. COVID-19 has affected more than 100 countries in a matter of no time. People all over the world are vulnerable to its consequences in future. It is imperative to develop a control system that will detect the coronavirus. One of the solution to control the current havoc can be the diagnosis of disease with the help of various AI tools. In this paper, we classified textual clinical reports into four classes by using classical and ensemble machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering was performed using techniques like Term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF), Bag of words (BOW) and report length. These features were supplied to traditional and ensemble machine learning classifiers. Logistic regression and Multinomial Naïve Bayes showed better results than other ML algorithms by having 96.2% testing accuracy. In future recurrent neural network can be used for better accuracy.","Khanday, Akib Mohi Ud Din; Rabani, Syed Tanzeel; Khan, Qamar Rayees; Rouf, Nusrat; Mohi Ud Din, Masarat",Int J Inf Technol,,614
251518,Impact of the covid-19 pandemic in the gastroenterology department-the gastroenterologists' perspective nationwide and the real impact in a portuguese center,2021,"Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence is difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S-insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.","Bagdonaite, Ieva; Thompson, Andrew J; Wang, Xiaoning; Søgaard, Max; Fougeroux, Cyrielle; Frank, Martin; Diedrich, Jolene K; Yates, John R; Salanti, Ali; Vakhrushev, Sergey Y; Paulson, James C; Wandall, Hans H",Viruses,,614
251613,The Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Populations and Implications for Children and Health Care Policy,2020,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonists such as ketamine (KET) produce psychotic-like behavior in both humans and animal models. NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related to schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. It has been shown that prior long-term potentiation (LTP) occluded the increase of synaptic efficacy in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway induced by MK-801, a non-competitive NMDAr antagonist. However, it is not clear whether LTP could also modulate aberrant oscillations and short-term plasticity disruptions induced by NMDAr antagonists. Thus, we tested whether LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.","Lopes-Aguiar, Cleiton; Ruggiero, Rafael N; Rossignoli, Matheus T; Esteves, Ingrid de Miranda; Peixoto-Santos, José Eduardo; Romcy-Pereira, Rodrigo N; Leite, João P",Sci Rep,,614

In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was exposed to an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence lamp in simulated aging and degradation experiments. Ultraviolet degradation mechanisms were investigated on the surface after sunlight and UV lamp exposure. The plastic surfaces' molecular and surface degradation results were compared with their Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectra. By growing the length of exposure time increased stages of degradation were observed. After UV lamp and sunlight exposure, changing degradation levels were also determined with spectroscopic evaluations and the results were compared. LDPE was selected since it has a simple structure and a number of branched polymer structures that facilitate easily disruption of the chemical bond. Breaks in the polymer chain were easily seen in the plastics at the end of degradation and a fragile structure was formed throughout the polymer chain after accelerating UV light aging. The FTIR spectrum clarified the changed and fractured molecular bond structures of UV-exposed polyethylene. The change in the molecular structure of the plastic caused small changes in its color and small variations in this color change were detected by recording the Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrum. The Philips UV lamp's light intensity and the wavelength spectrum range were measured. The UV lamp and sun UV light doses were calculated and compared.","Dogan, Mustafa",Microsc. res. tech,,614

This article analyzes the impact that the COVID-19 and the state of alarm has had on Spanish social service professionals. An ad hoc questionnaire was used, administered on-line, individually, voluntarily and anonymously to 560 professionals working in social services, both in the public and private sectors, based throughout Spain. This questionnaire has five different parts: socio-demographic profiling, impact that the health crisis has had on the practice of professional functions, degree of knowledge of the measures imposed to guarantee the protection and safety of professionals and users, impact that it has had on the professional and personal development of social services professionals and, the fifth and last part, degree of adaptation of the measures aimed at the care of the vulnerable population. These results are discussed based on the situation in which professionals working in this sector find themselves in the face of the changes they are experiencing in the development of their work, and we are able to determine the profile of the workers who have felt most affected by the situation, with the consequent and foreseeable mental and emotional affectation that this implies. These professionals tend to value more negatively the set of measures developed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on Spanish social services.","Muñoz-Moreno, Rocío; Chaves-Montero, Alfonso; Morilla-Luchena, Aleix; Vázquez-Aguado, Octavio",PLoS One,,614

The clinical course among nonpregnant women has been described, but data about potential risks for women and their fetus remain scarce. The SARS and MERS epidemics were responsible for miscarriages, adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes, and maternal deaths. For COVID-19 infection, only nine cases of maternal death have been reported as of 22 April 2020, and pregnant women seem to develop the same clinical presentation as the general population. However, severe maternal cases, as well as prematurity, fetal distress, and stillbirth among newborns have been reported. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic greatly impacts prenatal management and surveillance and raise the need for clear unanimous guidelines. In this narrative review, we describe the current knowledge about coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) risks and consequences on pregnancies, and we summarize available current candidate therapeutic options for pregnant women. Finally, we compare current guidance proposed by The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the World Health Organization to give an overview of prenatal management which should be utilized until future data appear.","Lambelet, Valentine; Vouga, Manon; Pomar, Léo; Favre, Guillaume; Gerbier, Eva; Panchaud, Alice; Baud, David",Prenat. diagn,,614

Our aim was to profile the transcriptome in leukocytes from critically ill patients positive for COVID19 compared to those negative for COVID19 to better understand the COVID19-associated host response. For these studies, all patients admitted to our tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected at the time of admission to the ICU. Transcriptome profiling of leukocytes via ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) was then performed and differentially expressed genes as well as significantly enriched gene sets were identified. RESULTS: We enrolled seven COVID19 + (PCR positive, 2 SARS-CoV-2 genes) and seven age- and sex-matched COVID19- (PCR negative) control ICU patients. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that COVID19- patients had significantly higher total white blood cell counts and circulating neutrophils and COVID19 + patients were more likely to suffer bilateral pneumonia. The mortality rate for this cohort of COVID19 + ICU patients was 29%. As indicated by both single-gene based and gene set (GSEA) approaches, the major disease-specific transcriptional responses of leukocytes in critically ill COVID19 + ICU patients were: (i) a robust overrepresentation of interferon-related gene expression; (ii) a marked decrease in the transcriptional level of genes contributing to general protein synthesis and bioenergy metabolism; and (iii) the dysregulated expression of genes associated with coagulation, platelet function, complement activation, and tumour necrosis factor/interleukin 6 signalling. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that critically ill COVID19 + patients on day 1 of admission to the ICU display a unique leukocyte transcriptional profile that distinguishes them from COVID19- patients, providing guidance for future targeted studies exploring novel prognostic and therapeutic aspects of COVID19.","Gill, Sean E; Dos Santos, Claudia C; O039,; Gorman, David B; Carter, David E; Patterson, Eric K; Slessarev, Marat; Martin, Claudio; Daley, Mark; Miller, Michael R; Cepinskas, Gediminas; Fraser, Douglas D",Intensive Care Med Exp,,614

257620,Evaluation of Public Interest in Mohs Surgery and Other Elective Surgical Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Communication between health authorities and healthcare providers is an essential element of the response to public health emergencies. Although call centers can facilitate such communication, no published reports describing their outcomes exist. In advance of the expected COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, the Israel Center for Disease Control established a call center dedicated to queries from healthcare professionals. METHODS: The call center operated from February 5, 2020 (week 6) to May 14, 2020 (week 20). Data on calls received, including date and time, caller characteristics, questions and responses were recorded in a database designed for this purpose. The volume, sources and content of queries were analyzed. RESULTS: In 15 weeks of operation, the call center responded to 6623 calls. The daily number of calls ranged from 1 to 371 (mean 79.8, median 40), peaking on week 12, 2 weeks prior to a peak in new COVID-19 cases. Callers were predominantly physicians (62.4%), nurses (18.7%) and administrators (4.4%). Most worked in primary care clinics (74.2%) or hospitals (8.7%). Among physicians, 42.3% were family physicians or internists, and 10.0% were pediatricians. The issues most commonly addressed were home quarantine (21.6%), criteria for suspected cases (20.6%), and SARS-CoV2 testing (14.1%). Twenty-five percent of questions involved requests for clarifications of MOH guidelines regarding travel restrictions, clinic management, triage of symptomatic patients, routine medical and dental care, recommended precautions for health care workers with preexisting medical conditions, and other matters. A total of 119 queries were not resolved on the basis of existing guidelines and were referred to MOH headquarters. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a call center established to serve the needs of healthcare providers seeking guidance on COVID-19 management, and to facilitate communication of providers' concerns to the central health authority. Our work indicates that a central call center for healthcare providers can facilitate the development, implementation and amendment of guidelines and should be an integral element of the early response to public health emergencies.

The digital divide may have emerged as a key reinforcing mechanism of education through wealth and of future wealth through education during the pandemic. The intergenerational transmission of racial wealth inequality likely played out at rapid speed during the pandemic. We analyze the link between wealth, reliable internet and electronic device availability, remote learning time, race, and ethnicity, using the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey. We conclude that Black and Hispanic/Latinx households have less reliable internet and devices available. This goes along with fewer hours children spend on remote learning. The lack of internet and devices correlates with less wealth, as reflected in lower homeownership rates and greater housing instability. Black and Hispanic/Latinx households, in particular, are more likely to be renters and face housing instability.","Francis, Dania V.; Weller, Christian E.",The Review of Black Political Economy,,614
259627,Reluctance to seek pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic and the risks of delayed diagnosis,2020,"Flavonoids have been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antibacterial and antiviral efficacy. Therefore, in this study, we choose 85 flavonoid compounds and screened them to determine their in-silico interaction with protein targets crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The five important targets chosen were the main protease (Mpro), Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD), RNA - dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or Nsp12), non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) of SARS-CoV-2 and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) spike-RBD binding domain. The compounds were initially docked at the selected sites and further evaluated for binding free energy, using the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. The three compounds with the best binding scores were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The compound, tribuloside, had a high average binding free energy of -86.99 and -88.98 kcal/mol for Mpro and Nsp12, respectively. The compound, legalon, had an average binding free energy of -59.02 kcal/mol at the ACE2 spike-RBD binding site. The compound, isosilybin, had an average free binding energy of -63.06 kcal/mol for the Spike-RBD protein. Overall, our results suggest that tribuloside, legalon and isosilybin should be evaluated in future studies to determine their efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.","Mishra, Ganesh Prasad; Bhadane, Rajendra N; Panigrahi, Debadash; Amawi, Haneen A; Asbhy, Charles R; Tiwari, Amit K",Comput Biol Med,,614

While the COVID-19 pandemic has been increasingly affecting the world, the occurrence of disasters resulted in complex emergencies. The present review is aimed to identify the literature focused on health system response to coincidence of COVID-19 and disasters as well as describing their finding, implications and lessons-learned. METHODS: This study was conducted and reported based on PRISMA guideline. The databases of Web of Sciences, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and World Health Organization Library were searched. The inclusion criteria were all forms of published articles which investigated the coincidence of disasters and COVID-19 pandemic. Using the title and abstract screening, the selections of studies were performed by two researchers. Once, the relevant papers were finalized, the analysis was done in two parts of descriptive analysis and implications for health systems. RESULTS: Out of 1245 studies generated by initial search, a number of 13 articles was selected for final analysis. Earthquake was the most frequent disaster which its coincidence with COVID-19 was studied by researchers (31%). The implications of researchers for healthcare system were explained in three sections of climatic events, earthquakes and all hazard approach in relation to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Extracting the lessons learned from the regions affected by disasters at the time of COVID-19 pandemic can be helpful for healthcare professionals and policy-makers to improve their preparedness and response during disasters and a serious pandemic such as COVID-19. Further research is needed to identify the factors which strengthen the preparedness of health system for the dual risk of natural hazards and pandemics.","Sohrabizadeh, Sanaz; Yousefian, Shiva; Bahramzadeh, Amirhosein; Vaziri, Mohammad Hossein",BMC Public Health,,614
261873,[COVID-19 pandemic : Effects on clinical care of cardiovascular patients in spring 2020],2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 response, nonclinical essential workers usually worked overtime and experienced significant work stress, which subsequently increased their risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and pre-existing conditions. Deaths on duty, including deaths due to overwork, during the COVID-19 response were usually reported on web-based platforms for public recognition and solidarity. Although no official statistics are available for these casualties, a list of on-duty deaths has been made publicly available on the web by crowdsourcing. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the trends and characteristics of deaths related to overwork among the frontline nonclinical essential workers participating in nonpharmaceutical interventions during the first wave of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Based on a web-based crowdsourced list of deaths on duty during the first wave of the COVID-19 response in China, we manually verified all overwork-related death records against the full-text web reports from credible sources. After excluding deaths caused by COVID-19 infection and accidents, a total of 340 deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers were attributed to combatting the COVID-19 crisis. We coded the key characteristics of the deceased workers, including sex, age at death, location, causes of death, date of incidence, date of death, containment duties, working area, and occupation. The temporal and spatial correlations between deaths from overwork and COVID-19 cases in China were also examined using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: From January 20 to April 26, 2020, at least 340 nonclinical frontline workers in China were reported to have died as a result of overwork while combatting COVID-19. The weekly overwork mortality was positively correlated with weekly COVID-19 cases (r=0.79, P<.001). Two-thirds of deceased workers (230/340, 67.6%) were under 55 years old, and two major causes of deaths related to overwork were cardiovascular diseases (138/340, 40.6%) and cerebrovascular diseases (73/340, 21.5%). Outside of Hubei province, there were almost 2.5 times as many deaths caused by COVID-19-related overwork (308/340, 90.6%) than by COVID-19 itself (n=120). CONCLUSIONS: The high number of deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers at the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic is alarming. Policies for occupational health protection against work hazards should therefore be prioritized and enforced.","Wang, Zhicheng; Lin, Leesa; Guo, Yan; Xiong, Huayi; Tang, Kun",J Med Internet Res,,614
262120,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on epilepsy practice in India: A tripartite survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes thromboembolic complications during or post-infection period despite a lack of conventional risk factors. The study aims to learn fundamental changes in COVID-19 patients who underwent embolectomy in terms of clinical characteristics and clot composition. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study design, we evaluated 21 patients who underwent embolectomy in our clinic between March 12, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Demographics, characteristics, and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. Histopathological assessment was held in the pathology department. RESULTS: Of these 21 patients, 11 (52.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 10 (47.6%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. There is no statistical difference in terms of anatomic distribution, diagnostic method, length of hospital stay, amputation or mortality levels. Thromboembolic material of COVID-19 patients include significantly less red blood cell (RBC) (21.2-32.6%; P= 0.01), more lymphocyte (14.1-2.6%; P< 0.001), and more leukocyte (27.1-22.1%; P= 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the fibrin ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory cells are prominent in arterial thromboembolic material of COVID-19 patients. A combination of hyperinflammation and prothrombotic status may be responsible for this phenomenon.","Yesilkaya, Nihan; Tellioglu, Tahsin Murat; Unay, Fulya Cakalagaoglu; Iner, Hasan; Besir, Yuksel; Gokalp, Orhan; Yilik, Levent; Gurbuz, Ali",Ann. vasc. surg,,614

263761,Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on sleep duration in children and adolescents: A survey across different continents,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Countries have adopted different approaches, at different times, to reduce the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cross-country comparison could indicate the relative efficacy of these approaches. We assess various nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), comparing the effects of voluntary behavior change and of changes enforced via official regulations, by examining their impacts on subsequent death rates. DATA SOURCES: Secondary data on COVID-19 deaths from 13 European countries, over March-May 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We examine two types of NPI: the introduction of government-enforced closure policies and self-imposed alteration of individual behaviors in the period prior to regulations. Our proxy for the latter is Google mobility data, which captures voluntary behavior change when disease salience is sufficiently high. The primary outcome variable is the rate of change in COVID-19 fatalities per day, 16-20 days after interventions take place. Linear multivariate regression analysis is used to evaluate impacts. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: publicly available. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Voluntarily reduced mobility, occurring prior to government policies, decreases the percent change in deaths per day by 9.2 percentage points (pp) (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-14.0 pp). Government closure policies decrease the percent change in deaths per day by 14.0 pp (95% CI 10.8-17.2 pp). Disaggregating government policies, the most beneficial for reducing fatality, are intercity travel restrictions, canceling public events, requiring face masks in some situations, and closing nonessential workplaces. Other sub-components, such as closing schools and imposing stay-at-home rules, show smaller and statistically insignificant impacts. CONCLUSIONS: NPIs have substantially reduced fatalities arising from COVID-19. Importantly, the effect of voluntary behavior change is of the same order of magnitude as government-mandated regulations. These findings, including the substantial variation across dimensions of closure, have implications for the optimal targeted mix of government policies as the pandemic waxes and wanes, especially given the economic and human welfare consequences of strict regulations.","Jamison, Julian C; Bundy, Donald; Jamison, Dean T; Spitz, Jacob; Verguet, Stéphane",Health serv. res,,614
264589,Global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cytopathology practice: Results from an international survey of laboratories in 23 countries,2020,"Online speech governance stands at an inflection point. The state of emergency that platforms invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic is subsiding, and lawmakers are poised to transform the regulatory landscape. What emerges from this moment will shape the most important channels for communication in the modern era and have profound consequences for individuals, societies, and democratic governance. Tracing the path to this point illuminates the tasks that the institutions created during this transformation must be designed to do. This history shows that where online speech governance was once dominated by the First Amendment tradition's categorical and individualistic approach to adjudicating speech conflicts, that approach became strained, and online speech governance now revolves around two other principles: proportionality and probability. Proportionality requires no longer focusing on the speech interest in an individual post alone, but also taking account of other societal interests that can justify proportionate limitations on content. But the unfathomable scale of online speech makes enforcement of rules only ever a matter of probability: Content moderation will always involve error, and so the pertinent questions are what error rates are reasonable and which kinds of errors should be preferred. Platforms' actions during the pandemic have thrown into stark relief the centrality of these principles to online speech governance and also how undertheorized they remain. This Article reviews the causes of this shift from a ""posts-as-trumps"" approach to online speech governance to one of systemic balancing and what this new era of content moderation entails for platforms and their regulators.","Douek, E.",Columbia Law Review,,614

265383,"Evaluating the effect of demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and risk aversion on mobility during the COVID-19 epidemic in France under lockdown: a population-based study",2020,"Importance: Decision-making in the timing of tracheostomy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has centered on the intersection of long-standing debates on the benefits of early vs late tracheostomy, assumptions about timelines of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, and concern over risk to surgeons performing tracheostomy. Multiple consensus guidelines recommend avoiding or delaying tracheostomy, without evidence to indicate anticipated improvement in outcomes as a result. Objective: To assess outcomes from early tracheostomy in the airway management of patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective medical record review was completed of 148 patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation at a single tertiary-care medical center in New York City from March 1 to May 7, 2020. Interventions: Open or percutaneous tracheostomy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were time from symptom onset to (1) endotracheal intubation, (2) tracheostomy; time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy; time from tracheostomy to (1) tracheostomy tube downsizing, (2) decannulation; total time on mechanical ventilation; and total length of stay. Results: Participants included 148 patients, 120 men and 28 women, with an overall mean (SD) age of 58.1 (15.8) years. Mean (SD; median) time from symptom onset to intubation was 10.57 (6.58; 9) days; from symptom onset to tracheostomy, 22.76 (8.84; 21) days; and from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy, 12.23 (6.82; 12) days. The mean (SD; median) time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation was 33.49 (18.82; 27) days; from tracheostomy to first downsize, 23.02 (13.76; 19) days; and from tracheostomy to decannulation, 30.16 (16.00; 26) days. The mean (SD; median) length of stay for all patients was 51.29 (23.66; 45) days. Timing of tracheostomy was significantly associated with length of stay: median length of stay was 40 days in those who underwent early tracheostomy (within 10 days of endotracheal intubation) and 49 days in those who underwent late tracheostomy (median difference, -8; 95% CI, -15 to -1). In a competing risks model with death as the competing risk, the late tracheostomy group was 16% less likely to discontinue mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.28). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study from the first 2 months of the pandemic in New York City provides an opportunity to reconsider guidelines for tracheostomy for patients with COVID-19. Findings demonstrated noninferiority of early tracheostomy and challenges recommendations to categorically delay or avoid tracheostomy in this patient population. When aligned with emerging evidence about the timeline of infectivity of the novel coronavirus, this approach may optimize outcomes from tracheostomy while keeping clinicians safe.","Kwak, Paul E; Connors, Joseph R; Benedict, Peter A; Timen, Micah R; Wang, Binhuan; Zhang, Yan; Youlios, Stephanie; Sureau, Kimberly; Persky, Michael J; Rafeq, Samaan; Angel, Luis; Amin, Milan R",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

In this paper, machine learning models based on a Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm are built to assess the outbreak impact on air quality in Quito, Ecuador. First, the precision of the prediction was evaluated by cross-validation on the four years prelockdown, showing a high accuracy to estimate the real pollution levels. Then, the changes in pollution are quantified. During the full lockdown, air pollution decreased by -53 ± 2%, -45 ± 11%, -30 ± 13%, and -15 ± 9% for NO2, SO2, CO, and PM2.5, respectively. The traffic-busy districts were the most impacted areas of the city. After the transition to the partial relaxation, the concentrations have nearly returned to the levels as before the pandemic. The quantification of pollution drop is supported by an assessment of the prediction confidence.","Rybarczyk, Yves; Zalakeviciute, Rasa",Geophys Res Lett,,614

METHODS: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units across the US. Secondary outcomes were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT), thrombotic events, and seven blood markers of inflammation and thrombosis. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models were used. RESULTS: Among the 4,908 study patients, mean (SD) age was 60.9 (14.7) years, 3,095 (62.8%) were male, and 2,552 (52.0%) had obesity. In multivariable models, BMI was not associated with mortality. Higher BMI beginning at 25 kg/m2 was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT but not thrombosis. There was no clinically significant association between BMI and inflammatory or thrombotic markers. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with COVID-19, higher BMI was not associated with death or thrombotic events but was associated with a greater risk of ARDS and AKI-RRT. The lack of an association between BMI and circulating biomarkers calls into question the paradigm that obesity contributes to poor outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 by upregulating systemic inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways.","Friedman, Allon N; Guirguis, John; Kapoor, Rajat; Gupta, Shruti; Leaf, David E; Timsina, Lava R",Obesity (Silver Spring),,614

Serological assays are used to diagnose MERS-CoV infection and to screen for serum antibodies in seroepidemiological studies. The conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the preferred tool for detecting serum antibodies specific for pathogens; however, the utility of conventional ELISA with respect to detection of MERS-CoV antibodies is limited due to the number of false-positives caused by cross-reactivity of serum antibodies with antigens that are conserved among coronaviruses. The competitive ELISA (cELISA) uses a pathogen-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) that competes with serum antibodies for binding to an antigen; therefore, it is used widely for serological surveillance of many pathogens. In this chapter, I describe detection of serum antibodies using cELISA based on MAbs specific for MERS-CoV.","Fukushi, Shuetsu",Methods Mol Biol,,614

It was hypothesised that high care disruptions and psychological stress would be observed among paediatric and adult CHD patients in the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, international, electronic survey study was completed. Eligible participants included parents of children with acquired or CHD, adults with CHD, or caregivers of adults with CHD. RESULTS: A total of 1220 participants from 25 countries completed the survey from 16 April to 4 May, 2020. Cardiac care disruption was significant with 38% reporting delays in pre-pandemic scheduled cardiac surgeries and 46% experiencing postponed cardiac clinic visits. The majority of respondents (75%) endorsed moderate to high concern about the patient with heart disease becoming ill from COVID-19. Worry about returning for in-person care was significantly greater than worry of harm to patient due to postponed care. Clinically significant psychological stress was high across the sample including children (50%), adults with CHD (42%), and caregivers (42%). CONCLUSIONS: The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to considerable disruptions in cardiac care for patients with paediatric and adult CHD. COVID-19-related fears are notable with potential to impact willingness to return to in-person care. Psychological stress is also very high necessitating intervention. Further study of the impact of delays in care on clinical outcomes is warranted.","Cousino, Melissa K; Pasquali, Sara K; Romano, Jennifer C; Norris, Mark D; Yu, Sunkyung; Reichle, Garrett; Lowery, Ray; Viers, Suzanne; Schumacher, Kurt R",Cardiol Young,,614

We also aimed to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients whose procedures and surgeries had to be postponed due to COVID-19-related restrictions. METHODS: The number of patients admitted to the outpatient clinic, outpatient procedures, emergency consultation requests, hospitalised patients and the total number of surgeries between March 10, 2020 and June 15, 2020 were evaluated. These numbers were compared with the same period of 2019. Subsequently, patients who could not be operated or whose elective surgeries were postponed between March 10, 2020 and June 15, 2020 were determined(n:96). These patients were asked to fill out Beck Depression Inventory(BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory(STAI). The presence of difference between the baseline anxiety levels and the anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated. Afterwards, these patients were divided into two groups based on planned procedures as oncological group (group1) and non-oncological group (group2). The presence of a difference between the anxiety and depression levels between the groups was investigated. RESULTS: There was a drastic decline in number of patients in all assessed parameters. The least amount of change was seen in the number of emergency consultations. The evaluation of anxiety and depression scores of the patients showed a significant difference between their STAI-S and STAI-T scores (51.8 ± 9.3, 38.2 ± 7.5, respectively)(P < .001). STAI-S scores of the patients were found to be compatible with severe anxiety. The patients' mean BDI score was found to be 15 ± 8.9, which indicated mild depression. However, the age and STAI-S values were significantly higher in group1. CONCLUSION: We noted that anxiety and depression levels increased in patients whose operations were delayed because of pandemic-related restrictions, especially in oncological patients. We believe that an important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by planning advance psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups during pandemics.","Micoogullari, Uygar; Kisa, Erdem; Yucel, Cem; Ozbilen, Mert Hamza; Karaca, Erkin; Cakici, Mehmet Caglar; Ozcift, Burak; Ilbey, Yusuf Ozlem",Int J Clin Pract,,614

Consequently, it is critical that we ensure the process of pleading guilty is as free of coercion as possible. Yet, research has indicated that incarcerating defendants to await trial could have an undue influence on their decision to plead guilty. The current research employed a novel computer simulation to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on plea decision making among the innocent and the guilty when faced with potential pretrial detention. While presenting COVID-related information to participants increased both true and false guilty pleas, further analyses indicated that concerns about COVID-19 weighed more heavily on the innocent than the guilty. These findings illustrate the negative impact a pandemic could have in combination with a system of pleas that often allows prosecutors to provide defendants with just one guaranteed respite from jail-a guilty plea.

271577,Psychological sequelae within different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review of extant evidence,2020,"Background and Objectives: The recent outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic can be stressful for many people, who could resolve to addictive substances or other addictive behaviors as coping strategies. The purpose of this study was to detect changes in alcohol, tobacco, cannabis use and gambling in the general population, during the covid-19 lockdown in Greece. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted online, using the AUDIT-C questionnaire for alcohol use, the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence, and qualitative questions about alcohol, tobacco, cannabis use and gambling. Results were analyzed using the SPSS v.26 software. Results: Of N = 1365 responders, 300 abstained completely. During lockdown: 43.7% of alcohol users reported drinking less or abstain, followed by a lower mean score in AUDIT-C (p &lt; 0.001), 1/3 of tobacco smokers reported that they smoked more, confirmed by a difference in Fagerstrom Test scores (p &lt; 0.001). 67.4% of cannabis users reported abstinence and 71.4% of gamblers answered that they played less or not at all (females &gt; males, p = 0.031). Changes were mostly attributed to factors linked to the lockdown. Discussion and Conclusions: Alcohol, cannabis users and gamblers seemed to quit their habits during lockdown. Tobacco smoking seemed to become heavier, despite reports that smokers are more vulnerable to heavier respiratory symptoms after covid-19 infection. Present situation played a more important role, than fears about health. A significant percentage used alcohol or tobacco to cope with anxiety or depression.","Rantis, K.; Panagiotidis, P.; Parlapani, E.; Holeva, V.; Tsapakis, E.

273373,Scaling up and scaling out: Consilience and the evolution of more nurturing societies,2020,"Several medications commonly used for a number of medical conditions share a property of functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), or FIASMA. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that the ASM/ceramide system may be central to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We examined the potential usefulness of FIASMA use among patients hospitalized for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an observational multicenter study conducted at Greater Paris University hospitals. Of 2,846 adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 277 (9.7%) were taking an FIASMA medication at the time of their hospital admission. The primary end point was a composite of intubation and/or death. We compared this end point between patients taking vs. not taking an FIASMA medication in time-to-event analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and medical comorbidities. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting (IPW). Over a mean follow-up of 9.2 days (SD = 12.5), the primary end point occurred in 104 patients (37.5%) receiving an FIASMA medication, and 1,060 patients (41.4%) who did not. Despite being significantly and substantially associated with older age and greater medical severity, FIASMA medication use was significantly associated with reduced likelihood of intubation or death in both crude (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.58-0.87, P < 0.001) and primary IPW (HR = 0.58, 95%CI = 0.46-0.72, P < 0.001) analyses. This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses and was not specific to one particular FIASMA class or medication. These results show the potential importance of the ASM/ceramide system in COVID-19 and support the continuation of FIASMA medications in these patients. Double-blind controlled randomized clinical trials of these medications for COVID-19 are needed.","Hoertel, Nicolas; Sánchez-Rico, Marina; Gulbins, Erich; Kornhuber, Johannes; Carpinteiro, Alexander; Lenze, Eric J; Reiersen, Angela M; Abellán, Miriam; de la Muela, Pedro; Vernet, Raphaël; Blanco, Carlos; Cougoule, Céline; Beeker, Nathanaël; Neuraz, Antoine; Gorwood, Philip; Alvarado, Jesús M; Meneton, Pierre; Limosin, Frédéric",Clin. pharmacol. ther,,614

The evolution of their vibrational spectra is understood in the context of the variation of &#960;-electron delocalization as a result of the twisting imparted by the belt structure and in terms of the modulation of the resonance Raman/ROA effects which are photonic properties also tuned by anthracene twisting. The Raman/ROA vibrational spectra are simulated by several theoretical approaches to account for their vibrational and electronic properties including the theoretical evaluation of resonance effects. We furthermore incorporate a vibrational and ROA activity dissection analysis as provided in the Pyvib2 program valid to establish correlations among vibrational modes of different molecules with different electronic structures and equivalent vibrational dynamics. This paper is one of the very first attempts to use ROA spectroscopy in &#960;-conjugated molecules with twisted and helical morphologies that contrast with the well-known cases of ROA studies of chiral helicenes in which the impact of &#960;-electron delocalization in the electronic/photonic/vibrational (Raman/ROA) spectra is negligible.,"Palomo, Luis; Gordillo Gámez, Fernando; Bedi, Anjan; Gidron, Ori; Casado, Juan; Ramírez, Francisco J",PCCP.

However, the role of physical activity in this context is still debated. By taking advantage of a previous survey, conducted online from 22 April to 7 May 2020, we performed a post-hoc analysis with the aim to assess the associations between disability, physical exercise, and mental health in multiple sclerosis. We retrieved the following data: (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) changes in lifestyle (including exercise), (iii) physical disability, as measured with the Patient-Determined Disease Steps scale, and (iv) anxiety feelings and depressive symptoms assessed via the items included in the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders measurement system. Examination of the interaction plot showed that the effect of disability on depression, but not on anxious symptoms, was significant for all levels of physical exercise (low: b = 1.22, 95% C.I. 0.85, 1.58, p < 0.001; moderate: b = 0.95, 95% C.I. 0.66, 1.24, p < 0.001; and high: b = 0.68, 95% C.I. 0.24, 1.13, p = 0.003). Based on these data, we can conclude that disability significantly impacted depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with physical activity playing a moderating role.

Psychodynamic places a large emphasis on defense mechanisms and unconscious mind, where upsetting feelings, urges, and thoughts that are too painful for us to directly look at are housed. Even though these painful feelings and thoughts are outside of our awareness, they still influence our behavior in many ways. Optimal application of psychodynamic approach offers the frame for acceptance of psychological stress in a more positive way and benefits psychological growth.

The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and comorbidities but have not been accurately defined.Objectives: To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan.Methods: Medical records were collected of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9, 2020, and February 15, 2020. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans, and clinical management.Measurements and Main Results: The median age of the patients was 65.8 years, and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), and dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% of patients had very low eosinophil counts on admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (63 [74.1%]), and arrhythmia (51 [60%]), among others. Most patients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]), and glucocorticoid (65 [76.5%]) treatments. A total of 38 (44.7%) and 33 (38.8%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and IFN-&#945;2b, respectively.Conclusions: In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were males aged over 50 years with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure. Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations.

276272,Benefits of Avoiding Unnecessary Medical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has required clinicians to urgently identify new treatment options or the re-purposing of existing drugs. Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The aims of this systematic review are to systematically identify and collate 24 studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and to provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Of clinical trials, 100% showed no significant difference in the probability of viral transmission or clearance in prophylaxis or therapy, respectively, compared to the control group. Among observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy, 58% concurred with the finding of no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes. Three-fifths of clinical trials and half of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects, 44% found a greater incidence of QTc prolongation and/or arrhythmias, 44% found no evidence of a significant difference, and 11% mixed results. The strongest available evidence points towards the inefficacy of CQ and HCQ in prophylaxis or in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients.","Takla, Michael; Jeevaratnam, Kamalan",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,,614

Since 2010, surgical 'boot camps' have been run by many UK deaneries to teach core surgical trainees basic entry level skills. Training in advanced skills often requires attendance at national fee-paying courses. In the Wessex Deanery, multiple, free of charge, core surgical 'field camps' were developed to provide more advanced level teaching in the particular specialty preference of each core surgical trainee. After the COVID-19 pandemic, national hands-on courses will be challenging to provide and deanery-based advanced skills training may be the way forward for craft-based specialties. The experiences over 2 years of delivering the Wessex core surgical field camps are shared, giving a guide and advice for other trainers on how to run a field camp.","Room, H J; Ji, C; Kohli, S; Choh, Ctp; Robinson, P; Knight, J; Dennis, S",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,614

The way the latter was confronted is of fundamental importance for a serious discussion on global health, ethics and human rights, and this experience could and can still be applied to Covid-19. The Covid-19 pandemic has specific characteristics and these will be discussed, in relation to vaccine research and especially to the global right to equal access to products proven to be safe and effective. The article focusses primarily on issues related to Covid-19 vaccines, especially the appropriate use and limits on placebo, the right to post-trial access to placebo arm participants, and the use of an active control for subsequent Phase-3 trials after the approval of other safe and efficacious vaccines. Most importantly, it will emphasise that access to Covid-19 vaccines is a human right, which presupposes the establishment of appropriate ethical standards to ensure universal, equal, and affordable access to healthcare and to vaccines for all, and the imperative need for suspension of patents for products developed for Covid-19. It will consider the role of social determinants that contribute to the severity of Covid-19 and that must be addressed to effectively curb the current syndemic.","Greco, Dirceu B",Indian J Med Ethics,,614

The combined hypo- and hyper-reward responses results in a reward imbalance, which has been noted as a relevant maintenance factor for eating disorders (EDs) characterized by binge eating. This registered report describes the protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing supportive therapy to a novel treatment targeting reward imbalance (Reward Re-Training; RRT) for individuals with binge eating. Aims of the current study include to confirm feasibility and acceptability of RRT, to evaluate the ability of RRT to engage critical targets, and to provide preliminary estimates of efficacy in reducing ED symptoms at both posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. Sixty participants will be randomized to either RRT or supportive therapy. For both conditions, treatment will be delivered in 10 weekly group outpatient therapy sessions conducted remotely using videoconferencing software. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, mid-treatment, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up to measure feasibility, acceptability, critical treatment targets (i.e., reward to day-to-day life activities, reward to palatable foods, social isolation, and loneliness), and ED symptoms.","Juarascio, Adrienne S; Michael, Megan L; Srivastava, Paakhi; Manasse, Stephanie M; Drexler, Sarah; Felonis, Christina R",Int. j. eat. disord,,614

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained one head in the multi-head self-attention model to attend to the Medical evidence Ddependency (MD) and to pass linguistic and domain knowledge on to later layers (MDinformed). This MD-informed attention model was integrated into BioBERT and tested on 2 public machine reading comprehension benchmarks for clinical trial publications: Evidence Inference 2.0 and PubMedQA. We also curated a small set of recently published articles reporting randomized controlled trials on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) following the Evidence Inference 2.0 guidelines to evaluate the model's robustness to unseen data. RESULTS: The integration of MD-informed attention head improves BioBERT substantially in both benchmark tasks-as large as an increase of +30% in the F1 score-and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance on the Evidence Inference 2.0. It achieves 84% and 82% in overall accuracy and F1 score, respectively, on the unseen COVID-19 data. CONCLUSIONS: MD-informed attention empowers neural reading comprehension models with interpretability and generalizability via reusable domain knowledge. Its compositionality can benefit any transformer-based architecture for machine reading comprehension of free-text medical evidence.","Kang, Tian; Turfah, Ali; Kim, Jaehyun; Perotte, Adler; Weng, Chunhua",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,614

METHODS: A total of 1000 informal caregivers, recruited offline, participated in a cross-sectional online survey from April 21 to May 2, 2020. Questionnaires were used to assess COVID-19-specific changes in the care situation, negative feelings in the care situation, problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures, concerns/excessive demands, loss of support, change in informal caregivers' own involvement in care and problems with provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information, and to relate these issues to five indicators of care involvement (i.e., being the main caregiver, high expenditure of time, high level of care, dementia, no professional help). Binomial and multiple regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Across indicators of care involvement, 25.5-39.7% reported that the care situation rather or greatly worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those caring for someone with dementia or those usually relying on professional help. In a multiple regression model, the mean number of involvement indicators met was associated with age (ß = .18; CI .10-.25), excessive demands (ß = .10, CI .00-.19), problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures (ß = .11, CI .04-.19), an increase in caregiving by the informal caregivers themselves (ß = .14, CI .03-.24) as well as with no change in the amount of caregiving (ß = .18, CI .07-.29) and loss of support (ß = -.08, CI -.16-.00). No significant associations with the mean number of involvement indicators met were found for gender, educational level, change in the care situation, negative feelings, and provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information. CONCLUSION: Those caregivers who perceived extensive care burden were those who suffered most during the pandemic, calling for structural support by the healthcare system now and in the future.

Elective surgery was initially halted and acute non-deferrable surgical care drastically limited. The presence of COVID-19 patients into intensive care units (ICU) is currently decreasing but their congestion have restricted our therapeutic strategies during the last months. METHODS: In the COVID-19 era eighteen patients (8 men, 10 women) with a mean age of 80 years, needing undelayable abdominal surgery underwent awake open surgery at our Department. Prior to surgery, all patients underwent COVID-19 investigation. In all cases locoregional anesthesia (LA) was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative pain has been monitored and regularly assessed. A distinct pathway has been set up to keep patients of uncertain COVID-19 diagnosis separated from all other patients. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 104 minutes. In only one case conversion to general anesthesia was necessary. Postoperative pain was always well controlled. None of them required postoperative intensive care support. Only one perioperative complication occurred. Early readmissions after surgery were never observed. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our experience awake laparotomy under LA resulted feasible, safe, painless and, in specific cases, the only viable option. For patients presenting fragile cardiovascular and respiratory, reserves and in whom general anesthesia (GA) would presumably increase morbidity and mortality we encourage LA as an alternative to GA. In the COVID-19 era, it has become part of our ICU-preserving strategy allowing us to carry out undeferrable surgeries.","Romanzi, Andrea; Moroni, Rossella; Rongoni, Erica; Scolaro, Roberta; La Regina, Davide; Mongelli, Francesco; Putortì, Antonella; Rossi, Fabrizio; Zanardo, Michel; Vannelli, Alberto",Minerva Chir,,614

281735,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatology nursing consultation,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease caused by a highly contagious virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this disease has affected millions of people across the world and led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Nutrition is a key factor related to this disease, and nutritional status may determine the risk and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Selenium is one of the major trace elements required for redox functions and has significant roles in viral infections. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence on the role of selenium in COVID-19. We reviewed studies on selenium and COVID-19, and other relevant studies to understand how selenium status can modify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how selenium status might affect a person post-infection. RECENT FINDINGS: We found that oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease, which is linked with the immunopathological disorder observed in individuals with severe COVID-19. Selenium plays a key role in strengthening immunity, reducing oxidative stress, preventing viral infections and supporting critical illness. Moreover, selenium deficiency is related to oxidative stress and hyperinflammation seen in critical illness, and selenium deficiency is found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Selenium supplementation at an appropriate dose may act as supportive therapy in COVID-19. Future studies in large cohorts of COVID-19 are warranted to verify the benefits of selenium supplementation for reducing risk and severity of COVID-19.","Khatiwada, Saroj; Subedi, Astha",Curr Nutr Rep,,614

Our aim was to investigate the physical and mental demands of mobile x-ray imaging on radiographers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, within a local NHS Trust. METHODS: A total of 16 participants from 1 NHS Trust took part within this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data was obtained through an online survey. Statistical data was obtained via the Trust Radiology Information System (RIS). Data was gathered for the thirteen weeks from 23rd March to 21st June 2020 (the first wave); direct comparison was made to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the data. These include mental health challenges/work morale in Radiology, demand of mobile imaging and departmental and Trust-wide mental health support. Results indicate a high demand in mobile imaging which has made a significant difference in the working life of some radiographers. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental health of a proportion of radiographers at this Trust. Results indicate high workload and demand in mobile imaging has made a significant difference to the working life of radiographers, specifically the ones who were relatively newly qualified. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Two key interventions are proposed from this study. The first one is to provide and promote mental health support within radiology departments. The second is to encourage dual working on mobile x-ray examinations to help manage the emotional and physical burden.","Yasin, B; Barlow, N; Milner, R","Radiography (Lond. Engl., 1995, Online)",,614

Adolescentsand young adults are at a time in their live when disruption in theireducation and social life, as well as uncertainty related to professionalprospects and long-term disease outcomes are all associated withsignificant personal concerns. The aim of this survey was to assess themain determinants of COVID-19 associated concern in adolescent andyoung adults with JSLE and JDM as well as their well-being andresilience.MethodsQuestionnaires comprising of questions related to patient and diseasecharacteristics, wellbeing, resilience and concern about the COVID-19pandemic were disseminated through hospital contacts and patient charities social media platforms. Participation was voluntary andimplied consent. The preliminary results of this ongoing survey havebeen analysed using descriptive statistics and linear regression (R).ResultsThe main patient and disease characteristics, self-reported well-being, resilience and perceived concern about the COVID-19 pandemic arepresented in comparison in male vs. female patients. Linear regressionshowed that the strongest determinant of COVID-19 concern was selfreported disease activity (p &lt; 0.0003). The self-reported diseaseactivity was associated with the COVID-19 concern level in bothfemale (P = 0.003) and male patients (p = 0.004) and also with diseaseduration in males (P = 0.018). The COVID concern was not affected byany other factors such as, employment, education, well-being orresilience.ConclusionThe preliminary analysis of our survey showed that patient-reportedCOVID-19 concern during the pandemic was strongly determined bythe self-reported disease activity irrespective of patients' sex, despitesignificantly increased concern in the female compared to malepatients, and association with disease duration in male patients only.We propose that further strategies for better patient support during thepandemic should focus on their optimal disease control as well as takeinto consideration the sex-biased patient concerns.","Khatun, A.; Wu, W.

The first hypothesis was that early postpartum dairy cows from different farms differ in the level of inflammation, which might be determined using APP assays in both pooled and individual blood samples. The second hypothesis was that the APP haptoglobin (Hp) might be the most sensitive parameter to detect cows at risk of excessive postpartum inflammation concomitant with systemic disease. Serum concentrations of Hp, serum amyloid-A (SAA), total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), coeruloplasmin (Cp) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 100 fresh lactating cows (within 0-8 d postpartum) from 10 farms were compared and associated to clinical health parameters (rectal body temperature, vaginal discharge (Metricheck&#8482; score), rumen fill, vulvovaginal laceration) using both pooled and individual blood samples. Mean serum concentrations of Hp, SAA and TP revealed significant differences among farms. Pooled serum samples of farms showed high correlations with the mean of individual samples. Only Hp was significantly positively correlated to both body temperature and Metricheck&#8482; score. In conclusion, Hp differentiates dairy farms regarding the inflammatory state of transition cows using individual and pooled serum samples within the first week postpartum. It also mirrors the individual degree of inflammation, thus proving to be a diagnostic parameter of high interest during the periparturient period.","Schmitt, Ruth; Pieper, Laura; Gonzalez-Grajales, L Antonio; Swinkels, Jantijn; Gelfert, Carl-Christian; Staufenbiel, Rudolf",J Dairy Res,,614

Given the sharp rise in online misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that influence the development of false memories. The present study measured susceptibility to false memories following exposure to fabricated news stories about the pandemic in a sample of 3746 participants. We investigated the effect of individual differences in (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) engagement with media or discussion about the coronavirus, (3) anxiety about COVID-19 and (4) analytical reasoning. Notably, objectively and subjectively assessed knowledge about COVID-19 were not significantly correlated. Objectively assessed knowledge was associated with fewer false memories but more true memories, suggesting a true discrimination between true and fake news. In contrast, participants who merely believed themselves to be very knowledgeable were more likely to report a memory for true stories, but showed no reduction in false memories. Similarly, individuals who reported high levels of media engagement or anxiety about COVID-19 reported an increase in true (but not false) memories. Finally, higher levels of analytical reasoning were associated with fewer memories for both true and fabricated stories, suggesting a stricter threshold for reporting a memory for any story. These data indicate that false memories can form in response to fake COVID-19 news and that susceptibility to this misinformation is affected by the individual's knowledge about and interaction with COVID-19 information, as well as their tendency to think critically.","Greene, Ciara M; Murphy, Gillian",Cogn Res Princ Implic,,614

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has increased nurses' role expectations and imposed a heavy social responsibility. In particular, frontline nurses are under significant stress when caring for patients during a novel epidemic because of the lack of accurate information. METHODS: A total of 232 nurses with experience in providing care for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients from seven large hospitals in three cities in Korea completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale and Predictive Nursing Intention Scale. RESULTS: Multiple regression confirmed that completing COVID-19-related education and self-efficacy were significant predictors of nursing intentions during the current pandemic; the regression model explained 22.0% of the variance in nursing intentions. CONCLUSION: Stress did not affect frontline nurses' nursing intentions towards COVID-19 patient care, but completing COVID-19-related education and higher self-efficacy predicted improved nursing intentions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse leaders should recognize that to improve nursing intentions during a novel infection outbreak, infection-related education should be provided and strategies to improve self-efficacy should be implemented.","Heo, Yu-Mi; Lee, Miyoung; Jang, Sun Joo",J. nurs. manag,,614

Therefore, the purification of these mixtures via preparative chromatography can be very challenging. This typically involves ternary or central-cut separations, characterized by chromatograms where the central peak, corresponding to the target product, exhibits significant overlapping on both sides with impurities slightly more or less adsorbable. In single-column (batch) preparative chromatography, this leads to a typical yield-purity tradeoff, meaning that high purity can be obtained at the cost of low yield and vice versa, with obvious consequences on the overall production costs. This study demonstrates how this limitation can be alleviated using the continuous countercurrent operating mode, conducted on a multicolumn system, as a tool for process intensification. In particular, the Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) process has been applied to the purification of an industrial crude mixture of icatibant, which is a peptidomimetic antagonist of bradykinin B2-receptor that has been recently also considered for the treatment of patients affected by COVID-19 disease. It is shown that MCSGP allows conjugating process simplicity (using only two columns) with a significant improvement in process performance, compared to the corresponding batch process. This includes all process performance parameters: yield, productivity, and buffer consumption for a given purity specification of icatibant.","De Luca, C.; Felletti, S.; Bozza, D.; Lievore, G.; Morbidelli, M.; Sponchioni, M.; Cavazzini, A.; Catani, M.; Cabri, W.; Macis, M.; Ricci, A.",Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research,,614

285046,How human gross anatomy is being taught in occupational therapy programs in the United States,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than thirty five million people worldwide and caused nearly 1 million deaths as of October 2020. The microorganism causing COVID-19 was named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV). The aim of this study was to investigate the interactions of twenty-three phytochemicals belonging to different flavonoid subgroups with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV, and cellular proteases [transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), cathepsin B and L (CatB/L)]. The compounds interacted more strongly with CatB and CatL than with the other proteins. Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds played an important role in the receptor-ligand interactions. As a result of RBCI (relative binding capacity index) analysis conducted to rank flavonoids in terms of their interactions with the target proteins, (-)-epicatechin gallate interacted strongly with all the proteins studied. The results obtained from molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) methods also supported this data. According to Lipinski's rule of five, (-)-epicatechin gallate showed drug-likeness properties. Although this molecule is not capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), it was concluded that (-)-epicatechin gallate can be evaluated as a candidate molecule in drug development studies against 2019-nCoV since it was not the substrate of P-gp (P-glycoprotein), did not inhibit any of the cytochrome Ps, and did not show AMES toxicity or hepatotoxicity on eukaryotic cells.","Istifli, Erman Salih; Netz, Paulo A; Sihoglu Tepe, Arzuhan; Husunet, Mehmet Tahir; Sarikurkcu, Cengiz; Tepe, Bektas",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,614
285100,"Otorhinolaryngology services at a district hospital in Sabah, Malaysia during the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported. At first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect more than half of patients. The symptoms mainly include anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive presentations, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images consistent with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the value of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopists may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.","Gornet, J-M; Tran Minh, M L; Leleu, F; Hassid, D",J Visc Surg,,614

As of mid-April 2020, this virus has affected more than 180 countries and territories, infecting more than 1,650,000 individuals and causing over 100,000 deaths. With approximately 20 million new cases globally per year, cancer affects a substantial portion of the population. Individuals affected by cancer are more susceptible to infections owing to coexisting chronic diseases (cardiovascular, pulmonary, and diabetes), overall poor health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by both cancer and the anticancer treatment. As a consequence, patients with malignancies, especially those with lung cancer who develop coronavirus disease 2019, experience more difficult outcomes. A recent multicenter study carried out by the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association has also documented that patients with lung cancer had an increased risk of death, intensive care unit requirement, risk of presenting severe or critical symptoms, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Here, we present two representative cases of patients with lung cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 without respiratory compromise and with atypical and severe skin manifestations-findings that could be influenced by the long-term use of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody.","Rolfo, Christian; Cardona, Andrés F; Ruiz-Patiño, Alejandro; Ariza, Santiago; Zatarain-Barron, Lucia; Pino, Luis E; Viola, Lucia; Russo, Alessandro; Rojas, Leonardo; Ricaurte, Luisa; Arrieta, Oscar",J. thorac. oncol,,614

290575,Mitigating the risks of surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Internationally the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a dramatic and unprecedented shift in telehealth uptake as a means of protecting healthcare consumers and providers through remote consultation modes. Early in the pandemic, Australia implemented a comprehensive and responsive set of policy measures to support telehealth. Initially targeted at protecting vulnerable individuals, including health professionals, this rapidly expanded to a ""whole population"" approach as the pandemic evolved. This policy response supported health system capacity and community confidence by protecting patients and healthcare providers; creating opportunities for controlled triage, remote assessment and treatment of mild COVID-19 cases; redeploying quarantined or isolated health care workers (HCWs); and maintaining routine and non-COVID healthcare. PURPOSE: This paper provides a review of the literature regarding telephone and video consulting, outlines the pre-COVID background to telehealth implementation in Australia, and describes the national telehealth policy measures instituted in response to COVID-19. Aligned with the existing payment system for out of hospital care, and funded by the national health insurance scheme, a suite of approximately 300 temporary telehealth Medicare-subsidised services were introduced. Response to these initiatives was swift and strong, with 30.01 million services, at a cost of AUD $1.54 billion, claimed in the first six months. FINDINGS: This initiative has been a major policy success, ensuring the safety of healthcare consumers and healthcare workers during a time of great uncertainty, and addressing known financial risks and barriers for health service providers. The risks posed by COVID-19 have radically altered the value proposition of telehealth for patients and clinicians, overcoming many previously encountered barriers to implementation, including willingness of clinicians to adopt telehealth, consumer awareness and demand, and the necessity of learning new ways of conducting safe consultations. However, ensuring the quality of telehealth services is a key ongoing concern. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a preference by policymakers for video consultation, the majority of telehealth consults in Australia were conducted by telephone. The pronounced dominance of telephone item numbers in early utilisation data suggests there are still barriers to video-consultations, and a number of challenges remain before the well-described benefits of telehealth can be fully realised from this policy and investment. Ongoing exposure to a range of clinical, legislative, insurance, educational, regulatory, and interoperability concerns and solutions, driven by necessity, may drive changes in expectations about what is desirable and feasible - among both patients and clinicians.","Hall Dykgraaf, Sally; Desborough, Jane; de Toca, Lucas; Davis, Stephanie; Roberts, Leslee; Munindradasa, Ashvini; McMillan, Alison; Kelly, Paul; Kidd, Michael",Int J Med Inform,,614

The existence of superspreading implies a fat-tailed distribution of infectiousness (new secondary infections caused per day) among different individuals. Here, we present a simple method to estimate the variation in infectiousness by examining the variation in early-time growth rates of new cases among different subpopulations. We use this method to estimate the mean and variance in the infectiousness, $k$, for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early stages of the pandemic within the United States. We find that $\sigma_k/\mu_k \gtrsim 3.7 $, where $\mu_k$ is the mean infectiousness and $\sigma_k$ is its standard deviation, which implies pervasive superspreading. This result allows us to estimate that in the early stages of the pandemic in the USA, nearly $88\%$ of new cases were a result of the top $10\%$ of most infectious individuals.","Pozderac, Calvin; Skinner, Brian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15673v1.pdf,614

291636,Guidelines for the management of surgical departments in non-uniform hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"AIMS: Pregnancy is associated with numerous changes in physiological and metabolic processes to ensure successful progression to full term. One such change is the alteration of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism and formation of eicosanoids. This study explores the changes in AA metabolites formed through the cytochrome P450 mediated pathway to epoxyeicosatrienoic (EET), dihydroxyeicosatrienoic (DHET), and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE) acids which have been implicated in blood pressure regulation and inflammatory responses that are important for a healthy pregnancy. MAIN METHODS: The study determines circulating levels of EETs, DHETs and HETEs extracted from erythrocyte membranes and measured by mass spectroscopy during the progression of a normal pregnancy. Blood samples, from 25 women, were collected at three time points including 25-28â¯weeks gestation, 28-32â¯weeks gestation, and the non-pregnant control at 3-4â¯months postpartum. KEY FINDINGS: Results demonstrate that healthy pregnancy is associated with significant increases in 8,9-DHET, 11,12-DHET and 14,15-DHET and a decrease in trans 8,9-EET during 28-32â¯weeks gestation compared to 3-4â¯months postpartum. These differences are likely due to several mechanisms including an increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase activity, a decrease in glutathione conjugation, and altered cytochrome P450 enzyme expression and/or activity that occurs during pregnancy. SIGNIFICANCE: Metabolism of AA through the cytochrome P450 pathway generates physiologically important eicosanoids that could play an important role in the progression of a healthy pregnancy. Establishing the changes that occur during normal pregnancy may, in the future, help in early detection of pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia.","Somani, Selina T; Zeigler, Maxwell; Fay, Emily E; Leahy, Maggie; Bermudez, Bethanee; Totah, Rheem A; Hebert, Mary F",Life Sci,,614

METHODS: Using social media to reach a broad range of physicians, a convenience sample of physician mothers completed on-line survey posted between April 27-May 11. Members were encouraged to repost on social media and share with personal contacts resulting in a passive snowball sampling effect. RESULTS: A total of 2709 physician mothers from 48 states, Puerto Rico and 19 countries representing more than 25 medical specialties completed the survey. Most were between 30-39 years of age, 67% self-identified as white, 17% as Asian, 4% as African American. Most had been working for 11-16 years. 91% had a spouse/partner of the opposite sex. Over half were practicing in an area they identified as high COVID19 density while 50% had personally cared for a person with COVID19. Physician mothers were most concerned about exposing their children to COVID19 and about the morale and safety of their staff.

Traditional amides are planar and the carbonyl group non-electrophilic due to nN â p*C=O conjugation. In this study, we report electrophilicity scale by exploiting 17O NMR and 15N NMR chemical shifts of acyclic twisted and destabilized acyclic amides that have recently received major attention as precursors in N-C(O) cross-coupling by selective oxidative addition as well as precursors in electrophilic activation of N-C(O) bonds. Most crucially, we demonstrate that acyclic twisted amides feature electrophilicity of the carbonyl group that ranges between that of acid anhydrides and acid chlorides. Furthermore, a wide range of electrophilic amides is possible with gradually varying carbonyl electrophilicity by steric and electronic tuning of amide bond properties. Overall, the study quantifies for the first time that steric and electronic destabilization of the amide bond in common acyclic amides renders the amide bond as electrophilic as acid anhydrides and chlorides. These findings should have major implications on the fundamental properties of amide bonds.","Ielo, Laura; Pace, Vittorio; Holzer, Wolfgang; Rahman, Md Mahbubur; Meng, Guangrong; Szostak, Roman; Szostak, Michal",Chemistry,,614

296730,The PanSurg-PREDICT Study: Endocrine Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Amid concerns of inadequate medical supplies and staffing anticipated from a surge in COVID-19 cases, many health care systems across the United States (U.S.) began shutting down non-essential patient services in March 2020. These sudden shifts bring up questions about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on already fragile rural health care systems and the ability of rural populations, including farmers and farm workers, to meet their health care needs. To provide alternative and safe access to health care, the Federal government relaxed telehealth regulations, which effectively removed some of the largest regulatory barriers that had limited the adoption of telehealth in the U.S. In this commentary, we draw on the example of the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), a large rural health care system in Wisconsin and provide an early assessment of how it adjusted its telehealth services during the early months of COVID-19. While the long-term effects of the pandemic on rural health care systems will not be known for some time, the example of MCHS points to the importance of on-going and sustained investments to support the resilience of health care systems and their ability to weather crises. With early evidence that MCHS patients and practitioners are interested in continuing to use telehealth post-COVID-19, we conclude our commentary by offering three recommendations to remove hurdles and improve quality of telehealth care.","Meyer, Chris; Becot, Florence; Burke, Rick; Weichelt, Bryan",J Agromedicine,,614

The presence of glycoproteins on the viral envelope opens a wide range of possibilities for application of lectins to address some urgent problems involved in this pandemic. In this work, we discuss the potential contributions of lectins from non-mammalian sources in the development of several fields associated with viral infections, most notably COVID-19. We review the literature on the use of non-mammalian lectins as a therapeutic approach against members of the Coronaviridae family, including recent advances in strategies of protein engineering to improve their efficacy. The applications of lectins as adjuvants for antiviral vaccines are also discussed. Finally, we present some emerging strategies employing lectins for the development of biosensors, microarrays, immunoassays and tools for purification of viruses from whole blood. Altogether, the data compiled in this review highlights the importance of structural studies aiming to improve our knowledge about the basis of glycan recognition by lectins and its repercussions in several fields, providing potential solutions for complex aspects that are emerging from different health challenges.","da Silva, Luís Cláudio Nascimento; Mendonça, Juliana Silva Pereira; de Oliveira, Weslley Felix; Batista, Karla Lílian Rodrigues; Zagmignan, Adrielle; Viana, Isabelle Freire Tabosa; Santos Correia, Maria Tereza",Glycobiology,,614
298480,Covid-19 pandemic and bats: a lucky symbol of evil fortune,2021,"AIM: Studies analyzing viral load in COVID-19 patients and any data that compare viral load with chest computerized tomography (CT) severity are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the severity of chest CT in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive patients and factors associated with it. METHODOLOGY: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swab samples by using Bio-speedy viral nucleic acid buffer. The RT-PCR tests were performed with primers and probes targeting the RdRp gene (Bioexen LTD, Turkey) and results were quantified as cycle threshold (Ct) values. Chest CT of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive patients (n = 730) in a period from 22 March to 20 May 2020 were evaluated. The total severity score (TSS) of chest CT ranged 0-20 and was calculated by summing up the degree of acute lung inflammation lesion involvement of each of the five lung lobes. RESULTS: Of the 284 patients who were hospitalized, 27 (9.5%) of them died. Of 236 (32.3%) patients, there were no findings on CT and 216 (91.5%) of them were outpatients (median age 35 years). TSS was significantly higher in hospitalized patients; 5.3% had severe changes. Ct values were lower among outpatients, indicating higher viral load. An inverse relation between viral load and TSS was detected in both groups. CT severity was related to age, and older patients had higher TSS (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Viral load was not a critical factor for hospitalization and mortality. Outpatients had considerable amounts of virus in their nasopharynx, which made them contagious to their contacts. Viral load is important in detecting early stages of COVID-19, to minimize potential spread, whereas chest CT can help identify cases requiring extensive medical care.","Karahasan Yagci, Aysegul; Sarinoglu, Rabia Can; Bilgin, Huseyin; Yanilmaz, Özgür; Sayin, Elvan; Deniz, Guneser; Guncu, Mehmet Mucahit; Doyuk, Zahide; Baris, Can; Kuzan, Beyza Nur; Aslan, Bülent; Korten, Volkan; Cimsit, Cagatay",Int J Infect Dis,,614

The vitamin D binding protein (DBP) with emphasis on its regulation of total and free vitamin D metabolite levels participate in various clinical conditions. The main goal of this study was to evaluate if there was any association between the DBP gene polymorphism at rs7041 and rs4588 loci and the prevalence of COVID-19 and its mortality rates caused among populations of 10 countries including Turkey. Positive significant correlations were found between the prevalence (per million) and mortality rates (per million), and GT genotype (P < .05) while there was a negative significant correlation between prevalence (per million) and mortality rates (per million), and TT genotype at rs7041 locus among all populations (P < .05). However, no significant correlation was found at rs4588 locus. GT genotype was found to confer this susceptibility to the populations of Germany, Mexico, Italy, Czech, and Turkey. The variations in the prevalence of COVID-19 and its mortality rates among countries may be explained by Vitamin D metabolism differed by the DBP polymorphisms of rs7041 and rs4588.","Karcioglu Batur, Lutfiye; Hekim, Nezih",J. med. virol,,614

The COVID-19 outbreak during the study period provided an opportunity to evaluate any pandemic influence on how telehealth was perceived by patients and physicians. METHODS: We included patients with AIH who were followed in the Harran University hospital, Turkey. Patients were managed by either remote telehealth or standard care. RESULTS: A total of 46 (telehealth, n=19 and standard care, n= 27) patients (40 female) with a median age of 32 (range 17-74) years at diagnosis were included in the study. Until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of biochemical remission and relapse after remission were similar in the telehealth and standard care groups (89.5% vs. 89.1% and 15.8% vs. 25.9%, p=ns, for both). The telehealth group maintained remission significantly better than the standard care group (100% vs. 77.3%, p=0.035) during the COVID-19 period. All relapses were due to non-adherence to therapy. Psychiatric problems, pregnancy-related issues and drug side-effects could all be managed remotely by telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show for the first time that telehealth is a feasible alternative for managing AIH, both under normal circumstances and during the COVID-19 pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) requires long-life lifelong immunosuppression and follow-up for most patients. The use of telehealth may be an alternative way to evaluate these patients remotely. We show for the first time that telehealth is effective and useful in the management of AIH in regular time as well during COVID-19. We hope that our study can extend use of telehealth in the evaluation of patients with other causes of chronic liver disease.","Efe, Cumali; Simsek, Cem; Batibay, Ersin; Caliskan, Ali Riza; Wahlin, Staffan",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,,614

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 443 employees of Krasmash JSC, who have been working under conditions of increased noise for at least 1 year, were surveyed and examined. A hearing study was performed by speech and tonal audiometry. Tonal audiometry was carried out in accord with according to a standard method in the frequency range 125-8000 Hz. People with chronic hearing impairment, survivors of meningitis and family history of hearing impairment were excluded from the study. The allelic composition of the studied genes was determined in the remaining group of 288 workers (study group). Polymorphisms were detected using bioluminescent method, developed by the authors earlier. The study group comprised 122 people with hearing impairment (experimental group) and 166 people without impairment (control group). RESULTS: The genotyping results of on allelic variants rs494024 (CAT), rs7598759 (NCL), rs2227956 (HSPA1L), rs7095441 (PCDH15) and rs7785846 (PON2) showed that their frequencies in the study group did not differ and were comparable with those for the European population. No statistically significant differences were revealed in the distribution of the genotypes of the studied mutations between the experimental and control groups. Also no statistically significant associations we found between hearing impairment and availability of two or several SNPs, or these SNPs and clinical characteristics of the disease (degree of hearing impairment, tinnitus). In the group of workers with an experience of 5 to 16 years, an association was found for hearing impairment and SNP rs494024, as well as when it is combined with rs7598759. CONCLUSIONS: The associations between SNP rs7598759, rs2227956, and rs7095441 and hearing impairment were not found. In the group of workers with 5-16 year experience, this association was found for SNP rs494024, as well as when it is combined with rs7598759.

302410,Managing the Return to Football During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of the Head Team Physicians of the Football Bowl Subdivision Programs,2021,"Several potent neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus have been identified. However, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has not been comprehensively studied for SARS-CoV-2, and the relationship between enhancing versus neutralizing activities and antibody epitopes remains unknown. Here, we select a convalescent individual with potent IgG neutralizing activity and characterize his antibody response. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from memory B cells target four groups of five non-overlapping receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. Antibodies to one group of these RBD epitopes mediate ADE of entry in Raji cells via an FcÎ³ receptor-dependent mechanism. In contrast, antibodies targeting two other distinct epitope groups neutralize SARS-CoV-2 without ADE, while antibodies against the fourth epitope group are poorly neutralizing. One antibody, XG014, potently cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as SARS-CoV-1, with respective IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values as low as 5.1 and 23.7 ng/mL, while not exhibiting ADE. Therefore, neutralization and ADE of human SARS-CoV-2 antibodies correlate with non-overlapping RBD epitopes.","Zhou, Yunjiao; Liu, Zezhong; Li, Shibo; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Qianqian; Silva, Israel T; Li, Cheng; Wu, Yanling; Jiang, Qingling; Liu, Zhenmi; Wang, Qiujing; Guo, Yu; Wu, Jianbo; Gu, Chengjian; Cai, Xia; Qu, Di; Mayer, Christian T; Wang, Xiangxi; Jiang, Shibo; Ying, Tianlei; Yuan, Zhenghong; Xie, Youhua; Wen, Yumei; Lu, Lu; Wang, Qiao",Cell Rep,,614
302538,How Much has COVID-19 Pandemic Affected Indian Orthopaedic Practice? Results of an Online Survey,2020,"Conventional approaches to isolate and characterize nanobodies are laborious and cumbersome. Here we combine phage display, multivariate enrichment, and novel sequence analysis techniques to annotate an entire nanobody repertoire from an immunized alpaca. We combine this approach with a streamlined screening strategy to identify numerous anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, and use neutralization assays and Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) epitope mapping to characterize their potency and specificity. Epitope mapping revealed that the binding site is a key determinant of neutralization potency, rather than affinity alone. The most potent nanobodies bind to the receptor binding motif of the RBD, directly preventing interaction with the host cell receptor ACE2, and we identify two exceptionally potent members of this category (with monomeric IC50s around 13 and 16 ng/ml). Other nanobodies bind to a more conserved epitope on the side of the RBD, and are able to potently neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 founder virus (42 ng/ml), the beta variant (B.1.351/501Y.V2) (35 ng/ml), and also cross-neutralize the more distantly related SARS-CoV-1 (0.46 g/ml). The approach presented here is well suited for the screening of phage libraries to identify functional nanobodies for various biomedical and biochemical applications.","Hanke, Leo; Sheward, Daniel J; Pankow, Alec; Vidakovics, Laura Perez; Karl, Vivien; Kim, Changil; Urgard, Egon; Smith, Natalie L; Astorga-Wells, Juan; Ekström, Simon; Coquet, Jonathan M; McInerney, Gerald M; Murrell, Ben",,,614

303094,MITIGATING THE 4th WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN ONTARIO,2021,"Although primarily a respiratory illness, several studies have shown that COVID-19 causes elevation of liver enzymes and various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The aim of this study was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether the presence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms contributed toward COVID-19 severity, and identify the GI symptoms characteristic of severe COVID-19. We conducted a literature search of PubMed from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, and identified all reports with GI symptoms reported. A meta-analysis comparing the severity of COVID-19 with the presence of liver enzyme elevation and GI symptoms was performed using RevMan version 5.4. Pooled data from 15,305 unique reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive COVID-19 patients from 44 studies were analyzed. We found that the severe COVID-19 patients significantly had abdominal pain compared to the non-severe COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.17-6.27, Z = 2.32, p = 0.02, I2 = 0%) by analyzed 609 patients of 4 studies who reported both abdominal pain and COVID-19 severity. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting between the two groups. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that abdominal pain could be characteristic of severe COVID-19 infections. Compared with other viral infections that primarily infect the respiratory system, patients with COVID-19 have a slightly lower frequency of diarrheal symptoms with abdominal pain. However, to confirm this, further studies with COVID-19 patients across various countries and ethnicities are required.","Hayashi, Yuki; Wagatsuma, Kohei; Nojima, Masanori; Yamakawa, Tsukasa; Ichimiya, Tadashi; Yokoyama, Yoshihiro; Kazama, Tomoe; Hirayama, Daisuke; Nakase, Hiroshi",J Gastroenterol,,614

Plant biotechnology offers potential solutions to this pandemic through the development of low-cost vaccines and antibodies useful for therapy, prophylaxis, and diagnosis. The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical trials with encouraging results. Thus far, some companies have started developing anti-COVID-19 antibodies and vaccines. In particular, plant-made antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks.

GBS is known to be postinfectious following several types of infections. Although causality can only be proven through large epidemiological studies, we intended to study this association by a thorough review of the literature. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Google scholar and included all papers with English or Spanish full text and original data of patients with GBS and recent COVID infection. Variables of interest were demographics, diagnostic investigations, and the latency between arboviral and neurological symptoms. Further variables were pooled to identify GBS clinical and electrophysiological variants, used treatments, and outcomes. The certainty of GBS diagnosis was verified using Brighton criteria. RESULTS: We identified a total of 109 GBS cases. Ninety-nine cases had confirmed COVID-19 infection with an average age of 56.07 years. The average latency period between the arboviral symptoms and neurologic manifestations for confirmed COVID-19 cases was 12.2 d. The predominant GBS clinical and electromyography variants were the classical sensorimotor GBS and acute demyelinating polyneuropathy respectively. Forty cases required intensive care, 33 cases required mechanical ventilation, and 6 cases were complicated by death. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on COVID-19-related GBS commonly reported sensorimotor demyelinating GBS with frequent facial palsy. The time between the onset of infectious and neurological symptoms suggests a postinfectious mechanism. Early diagnosis of GBS in COVID-19 patients is important as it might be associated with a severe disease course requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation.","Aladawi, Mohammad; Elfil, Mohamed; Abu-Esheh, Baha; Abu Jazar, Deaa; Armouti, Ahmad; Bayoumi, Ahmed; Piccione, Ezequiel",Can J Neurol Sci,,614

This study aims at analysing the problematic use of ICTs in trainee teachers based on the gender variable before and after the COVID-19 lockdown based on the gender variable. A longitudinal panel design was carried out with pre-test and post-test measurements based on the gender variable. The sample consisted of 147 students from the Faculty of Education at the University of Malaga who were tested using a validated instrument: MULTICAGE-TIC. The results show that women used ICTs at a higher risk than men before lockdown, except for video games. During lockdown, men obtain higher scores than women in all the analysed ICTs (except for mobile phones). Both genders reach dependency level in all ICTs except for video games in women. The significant increase in all ICTs shows that the effects of the pandemic, such as restrictions on mobility and social interaction, have influenced such growth.","Ernesto Colomo, Magaña Ariza Andrea Cívico Julio Ruiz Palmero Enrique Sánchez Rivas",Contemporary Educational Technology,,614

On the other hand, as risk assessment is performed daily and for several patients in general dental practice, the costs may be considerable. The objective was to summarize evidence in studies of economic evaluation of prognostic prediction multivariable models and methods of caries and periodontitis and to identify knowledge gaps (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020149763). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, NHS Economic Evaluation Database) and reference lists of included studies were searched. Titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers in parallel. Full-text studies reporting resources used, costs and cost-effectiveness of prediction models and methods were selected and critically appraised using a protocol based on items from the CHEERS checklist for economic evaluations and the CHARMS checklist for evaluation of prediction studies. RESULTS: From 38 selected studies, six studies on prediction fulfilled the eligibility criteria, four on caries and two on periodontitis. As the economic evaluations differed in method and perspective among the studies, the results could not be generalized. Our systematic review revealed methodological shortcomings regarding the description of predictive models and methods, and particularly of the economic evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review highlighted a paucity of economic evaluations regarding methods or multivariable models for prediction of caries and periodontitis. Our results indicate that what we currently practice using models and methods to predict caries and periodontitis lacks evidence regarding cost-effectiveness.","Fransson, Helena; Davidson, Thomas; Rohlin, Madeleine; Christell, Helena",,,614

The results showed that various CAM interventions have a positive effect on improving the various dimensions of coronavirus disease but since there are few studies in this regard, further studies using different CAM approaches are recommended.","Badakhsh, Mahin; Dastras, Majid; Sarchahi, Zohreh; Doostkami, Mahboobe; Mir, Adel; Bouya, Salehoddin",Rev. environ. health,,614
307308,Early look at the future of healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We consider the development of hyperbolic transport models for the propagation in space of an epidemic phenomenon described by a classical compartmental dynamics. The model is based on a kinetic description at discrete velocities of the spatial movement and interactions of a population of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals. Thanks to this, the unphysical feature of instantaneous diffusive effects, which is typical of parabolic models, is removed. In particular, we formally show how such reaction-diffusion models are recovered in an appropriate diffusive limit. The kinetic transport model is therefore considered within a spatial network, characterizing different places such as villages, cities, countries, etc. The transmission conditions in the nodes are analyzed and defined. Finally, the model is solved numerically on the network through a finite-volume IMEX method able to maintain the consistency with the diffusive limit without restrictions due to the scaling parameters. Several numerical tests for simple epidemic network structures are reported and confirm the ability of the model to correctly describe the spread of an epidemic.","Bertaglia, Giulia; Pareschi, Lorenzo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04019v1.pdf,614

We concluded that the epidemic is containable with traditional nonpharmacological interventions, mainly through social distancing and finding and isolating suspected patients and close contacts. Nonpharmacological interventions are the only effective measures currently accessible and have suppressed some 90% of the infections in China. Close contacts are the major mechanism of transmission, which makes it possible to control this epidemic through nonpharmacological methods. Nucleic-acid testing alone may miss some 50% of infected patients, and other methods such as chest computerized tomography (CT) or serology should be considered to supplement molecular testing. The development of vaccines and drugs is important, but hesitation to make use of nonpharmacological interventions may mean missing golden opportunities for effective actions.","Liang, Huiying; Zheng, Lingling; Xia, Huimin; Tang, Jinling",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,614

The health system was rapidly overwhelmed by the pandemic. It became evident that patients suffering from timesensitive medical emergencies like stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, trauma and acute myocardial infarction required timely, effective and safe pathways to be treated. The problem was addressed by a regional decree that created a hub-and-spoke system for time-sensitive medical emergencies. METHODS: We report the re-organizational changes adopted at a hub hospital (despite having already destined to COVID-19 patients most resources), and the number of emergent procedures for medical emergencies on the first 30-day of activity. These data were compared with the hospital activity in the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: Organizational changes were implemented in few hours. Dedicated pathways for non-COVID-19 patients affected by a medical emergency were set up in the emergency department, in the labs and in the operating theater. Ten intensive beds were implemented from a high-dependency unit; two operating rooms were reserved 24h/day to neurosurgical or trauma emergencies. The number of emergent procedures was not different from that of the previous year, no admission refusal, no treatment delay and no viral transmission to the treated patients were recorded. No viral transmission to health care workers was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Re-organization of a hospital in order to adopt a hub-and-spoke model resulted feasible and allowed to face acute coronary syndrome and other time-sensitive medical emergencies timely and safely.","Cabrini, Luca; Ageno, Walter; Balbi, Sergio; Baruzzi, Fabio; Candeloro, Elisa; Capra, Carlo; Carimati, Federico; Castiglioni, Battistina; Conti, Vinicio; De Ponti, Roberto; Franchi, Dario; Gini, Giancarlo; Giorgianni, Andrea; Sartorelli, Marianna; Landoni, Giovanni; Locatelli, Davide; Maffioli, Lorenzo; Pradella, Rita; Severgnini, Paolo; Tozzi, Matteo; Versino, Maurizio; Zocchi, Giuliano; Zoli, Alberto",Minerva cardioangiol,,614

The aim of research was to examine student misbehaviors encountered during online courses, to identify the most common and disruptive student misbehaviors from teachers' perspective and to put forth teachers’ suggestions about proper behaviors. The research was a phenomenological study. Data were gathered from 71 teachers teaching different courses and working at various levels. For data collection, a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers was used. It was assessed through descriptive analysis. According to findings, a list containing 27 different student misbehaviors was generated. Results showed that the most common misbehaviors were indifference to course, not attending course, turning off webcam and slanging. The most disruptive misbehaviors were making noise, absenteeism, and distractibility. Findings revealed that teachers had some ideas to overcome these misbehaviors such as taking attendance, getting family support, encouraging students to turn on webcam, creating intrinsic motivation and organizing parent meetings.

One hundred fifty participants were divided into four groups according to the number of days that they felt depressed due to the COVID-19 during the last 7 days: no-depression group (NDG, n=17), some-depression group (SDG, n=32), occasional-depression group (ODG, n=81), and most-depression group (MDG, n = 20). Shuttle run for endurance capacity and standing long jump for muscle power were selected to estimate the states of type I and type II muscle fibers, respectively. This study found that the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score of MDG was significantly higher than those of other three groups. In addition, ODG and MDG showed the lowest interest in their school studies compared with other groups. Endurance capacity showed a significant difference among groups, whereas muscle power showed no significant difference among groups. In conclusion, this study suggests that higher levels of depression reflect a greater lack of interest in life and academics. Furthermore, lower endurance capacity appears to be associated with more severe levels of depression. This highlights the importance of maintaining type I muscle fibers through regular aerobic exercise. © 2021 Korean Society of Exercise Rehabilitation. All Rights Reserved.","Min, S. K.; Son, W.

Place and Duration of Study: Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology from Mar 2020 to May 2020. Methodology: Records of patients presenting at the emergency department(ED during the lockdown period(23rd March 2020 to 7th May) was assessed. Similarly records of patients presenting to the emergency department during the same period last year was assessed. The two were than compared. Parameters compared included the gender difference, the underlying disease, the number of ST elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) patients, patients undergoing lysis and primary percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) and the mortality. Data analysis was done in terms of numbers and percentage change in each parameter. Results: There was considerable decrease in the number of patients visiting the emergency department(32.48%)i.e from 13326 to 8997. In addition, the ST elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) number declined considerably(37.84%) as did the primary percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) number(66.43%) and the number of patients coming with non ST elevation acute coronary syndromes(NSTEACS)(72.32%) and decompensated heart failure(86.86%). The overall emergency department mortality also reduced by 42.1%. There was however an increase in the percentage of ST elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) patients lysed. Conclusion: This study shows the dramatic decline in patient admissions with cardiac ailments in the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital highlighting the overall impact of morbidity and mortality secondary to the COVID 19 pandemic due to issues not directly related to COVID 19 and also gives us an eye opener to expect a high number of complicated cardiac patients coming to our hospital and to plan accordingly.","Hamid Sharif, Khan Mohsin Muhammad Mohsin Saif Javed Asim Hamdan Waqas Khawar Naeem Satti",Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal,,614
312453,The Effects of the 1st National COVID 19 Lockdown on Emergency Psychiatric Visit Trends in a Tertiary General Hospital in Israel,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic that started in China has spread within 3 months to the entire globe. We tested the hypothesis that the vaccination against tuberculosis by Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) correlates with a better outcome for COVID-19 patients. Our analysis covers 55 countries complying with predetermined thresholds on the population size and number of deaths per million (DPM). We found a strong negative correlation between the years of BCG administration and the DPM along with the progress of the pandemic, corroborated by permutation tests. The results from multivariable regression tests with 23 economic, demographic, health-related, and pandemic restriction-related quantitative properties, substantiate the dominant contribution of BCG years to the COVID-19 outcomes. The analysis of countries according to an age-group partition reveals that the strongest correlation is attributed to the coverage in BCG vaccination of the young population (0-24 years). Furthermore, a strong correlation and statistical significance are associated with the degree of BCG coverage for the most recent 15 years, but no association was observed in these years for other broadly used vaccination protocols for measles and rubella. We propose that BCG immunization coverage, especially among the most recently vaccinated population, contribute to attenuation of the spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Klinger, Danielle; Blass, Ido; Rappoport, Nadav; Linial, Michal",,,614

312869,COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological impact on anaesthesiologists,2020,"BACKGROUND: South Korea's aggressive responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have greatly slowed the epidemic without regional lockdowns. METHODS: The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's daily briefings were thoroughly reviewed. Information about hospital countermeasures and government coordination was collected via telephone interviews with 4 infection control team leaders, 1 emergency department nurse, and 1 infectious disease physician in Korea. RESULTS: After the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, the government and hospitals prepared for the inevitable outbreak of emerging infectious diseases by reforming the epidemic preparedness system. As a result, COVID-19 diagnostic test kits were quickly developed, enabling extensive early detection of potential cases. Other key steps were tracking cases, finding exposed individuals, coordinating case assignments with health care facilities, and selective clinic screenings for visitors' entering hospitals with mandatory mask wearing. Consequently, after overcoming the initial peak of the outbreak, which was related to a religious group, Korea has been able to maintain daily new cases at around 100 and to less than 50 daily cases in the second week of April. CONCLUSIONS: To counter the COVID-19 pandemic, which may persist, long-term, sustained response strategies must be prepared along with coordination between government and health systems.","Kang, JaHyun; Jang, Yun Young; Kim, JinHwa; Han, Si-Hyeon; Lee, Ki Rog; Kim, Mukju; Eom, Joong Sik",Am J Infect Control,,614

Here we summarized the patients we accepted in the fever outpatient department. Methods: Patients with epidemiologic history, respiratory symptoms or fever were required to go to the fever clinic for screening. Patients were finally laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Epidemiologic features, clinical presentation, laboratory findings and image features were collected and analyzed. Results: Totally, 16 patients were diagnosed as 2019-nCoV infection. The median age of the patients was 39.00 (35.25-55.75) years old, and the ratio of men and women was 9:7. Fifteen (93.75%) patients had clear epidemiologic history. The most common symptoms of the patients were fever (87.50%) and cough (n=8, 50.00%). The mean white blood cell count in the patients was (4.97±1.71) ×10?/L, and it was lower than 4.00×10?/L in 4 (25.00%) patients. The median neutrophil and lymphocyte count were 2.70 (1.84-3.27) ×10?/L and (1.52±0.53) ×10?/L respectively. The mean C-reactive protein level was 19.11±17.39 mg/L. Patients were likely had normal procalcitonin, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis. Fourteen (87.50%) patients had pneumonia in chest CT scan. Conclusions: No specific symptom was helpful in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection, but relatively low WBC and lymphocyte level might be suggestive to diagnosis. Most patients had fever and pneumonia, however, there were indeed some patients without fever and pneumonia. Screening procedure should not only focus on fever patients. The origin, transmission route, key targets of the virus and mechanism of infection deserved more studies.","Li, Yan; Xu, Shengyong; Du, Tiekuan; Xu, Jun; Li, Yi; Yu, Xuezhong; Zhu, Huadong",J.

Currently, long-term data on viral shedding and the serum antibody responses in COVID-19 patients are still limited. Herein, we report the clinical features, viral RNA loads, and serum antibody levels in a cohort of 112 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Honghu People's Hospital, Hubei Province, China. Overall, 5.36% (6/112) of patients showed persistent viral RNA shedding (> 45 days). The peak viral load was higher in the severe disease group than in the mild group (median cycle threshold value, 36.4 versus 31.5; P = 0.002). For most patients the disappearance of IgM antibodies occurred approximately 4-6 weeks after symptoms onset, while IgG persisted for over 194 days after the onset of symptoms, although patients showed a 46% reduction in antibodies titres against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein compared with the acute phase. We also studied 18 asymptomatic individuals with RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection together with 17 symptomatic patients, and the asymptomatic individuals were the close contacts of these symptomatic cases. Delayed IgG seroconversion and lower IgM seropositive rates were observed in asymptomatic individuals. These data indicate that higher viral loads and stronger antibody responses are related to more severe disease status in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the antibodies persisted in the recovered patient for more than 6 months so that the vaccine may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Xiaoyong; Lu, Suwen; Li, Hui; Wang, Yi; Lu, Zhen; Liu, Zhihong; Lai, Qingtao; Ji, Yali; Huang, Xuan; Li, Yongyin; Sun, Jian; Wu, Yingsong; Xu, Xiaoning; Hou, Jinlin",Virol Sin,,614

An archival research based on the Italian data stratified by region was performed in order to quantify the association between the population density, ageing index, number of positive cases, number of deaths, case-fatality rate, and medical equipment (gloves, masks, and ventilators). Results showed a significant positive linear relationship between the population density and cases, deaths, and case-fatality rate. No correlation with the ageing index was shown. Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation between the number of medical supplies and population density, cases, and deaths. However, the medical supplies did not show any correlation with the case-fatality rate.

To improve the understanding of transmission risks in six Scottish renal dialysis units, we utilised the rapid whole-genome sequencing data generated by the COG-UK consortium. METHODS: We combined geographical, temporal and genomic sequence data from the community and hospital to estimate the probability of infection originating from within the dialysis unit, the hospital or the community using Bayesian statistical modelling and compared these results to the details of epidemiological investigations. RESULTS: Of 671 patients, 60 (8.9%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2, of whom 16 (27%) died. Within-unit and community transmission were both evident and an instance of transmission from the wider hospital setting was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Near-real-time SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data can facilitate tailored infection prevention and control measures, which can be targeted at reducing risk in these settings.","Li, Kathy K; Woo, Y Mun; Stirrup, Oliver; Hughes, Joseph; Ho, Antonia; Filipe, Ana Da Silva; Johnson, Natasha; Smollett, Katherine; Mair, Daniel; Carmichael, Stephen; Tong, Lily; Nichols, Jenna; Aranday-Cortes, Elihu; Brunker, Kirstyn; Parr, Yasmin A; Nomikou, Kyriaki; McDonald, Sarah E; Niebel, Marc; Asamaphan, Patawee; Sreenu, Vattipally B; Robertson, David L; Taggart, Aislynn; Jesudason, Natasha; Shah, Rajiv; Shepherd, James; Singer, Josh; Taylor, Alison H M; Cousland, Zoe; Price, Jonathan; Lees, Jennifer S; Jones, Timothy P W; Lopez, Carlos Varon; MacLean, Alasdair; Starinskij, Igor; Gunson, Rory; Morris, Scott T W; Thomson, Peter C; Geddes, Colin C; Traynor, Jamie P; Breuer, Judith; Thomson, Emma C; Mark, Patrick B",J Infect,,614

315389,More studies showing longer COVID-19 incubation period in older adults and questioning the appropriate times for quarantine and contact tracing,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an algorithm for objective evaluation of distraction of surgeons during robot-assisted surgery (RAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electroencephalogram (EEG) of 22 medical students was recorded while performing five key tasks on the robotic surgical simulator: Instrument Control, Ball Placement, Spatial Control II, Fourth Arm Tissue Retraction, and Hands-on Surgical Training Tasks. All students completed the Surgery Task Load Index (SURG-TLX), which includes one domain for subjective assessment of distraction (scale: 1-20). Scores were divided into low (score 1-6, subjective label: 1), intermediate (score 7-12, subjective label: 2), and high distraction (score 13-20, subjective label: 3). These cut-off values were arbitrarily considered based on a verbal assessment of participants and experienced surgeons. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm was trained utilizing EEG recordings from the medical students and used to classify their distraction levels. The accuracy of our method was determined by comparing the subjective distraction scores on SURG-TLX and the results from the proposed classification algorithm. Also, Pearson correlation was utilized to assess the relationship between performance scores (generated by the simulator) and distraction (Subjective assessment scores). RESULTS: The proposed end-to-end model classified distraction into low, intermediate, and high with 94%, 89%, and 95% accuracy, respectively. We found a significant negative correlation (r = -0.21; p = 0.003) between performance and SURG-TLX distraction scores. CONCLUSIONS: Herein we report, to our knowledge, the first objective method to assess and quantify distraction while performing robotic surgical tasks on the robotic simulator, which may improve patient safety.

315582,An Aerosol Containment and Filtration Tent for Intubation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: To review the potential ancillary cardiovascular and other health impacts of compliance with general adult vaccination series in the prostate cancer active surveillance (AS) population. No previous review has been published in regard to this specific topic. METHODS: Literature review of PubMed data up to December 2020 RESULTS: Compliance rates for adult vaccination are in the approximate anemic range of 25-50% with occasional higher rates of specific vaccines in the elderly population including annual influenza and pneumococcal prevention. Herpes zoster (HZ) and numerous other vaccine preventive illnesses are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Preliminary evidence suggests vaccine compliance could reduce overall morbidity and mortality, and adherence to heart healthy lifestyle changes and parameters could further improve vaccine efficacy and overall wellness. COVID-19 vaccine utilization and research should also continue to reinforce the direct and ancillary benefits of this entire preventive intervention category. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple ancillary lifestyle change recommendations could be included in the AS criteria to potentially reduce morbidity and mortality in this population, and perhaps the most unsung intervention is to improve the inadequate rates of general adult vaccination compliance and other heart healthy behavioral changes that impact their efficacy. Heart health, prostate health, and immune system health are closely interlinked.","Moyad, Mark A",World j. urol,,614
315831,Asian journal of psychiatry and COVID-19; A window with a transcultural view - Reply to editor's letter,2021,"Donating money anonymously is often perceived as an act of altruism in Western culture and a similar concept of ‘ikhlas’ (sincerity) in Indonesia. Yet, this prosocial behavior can also be utilized to cope with unpleasant feelings associated with such donations (e.g., fear of social judgment, guilt) making it otherwise a rather self-serving act. In that regard, we analyzed 20,000 individual donation transactions made for COVID-19 campaigns on two popular fundraising platforms: GoFundMe in the United States and Kitabisa in Indonesia. We found that GoFundMe donors tended to self-identify (33.18% opted for anonymity) while Kitabisa donors tended to conceal their identities (73.89% opted for anonymity). Adjusting the donations to the fractions of GDPs, we further found that anonymous donors on Kitabisa donated significantly less amounts of money (M =.11, SD =.54) in contrast to their self-identified counterparts (M =.26, SD = 3.63), who donated even higher amounts of money than anonymous donors on GoFundMe (M =.16, SD =.66). Even though the amount of money may not always entail the rate of altruism nor ikhlas, the significant findings bring the cultural belief associated with such anonymous donations into questions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Firmansyah, F.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs the human capital approach to estimate the DMVHL (assuming Spain's life expectancy of 83 years and a 3% discount rate) of the 20,453 human lives lost in Spain from COVID-19 as of 19 April 2020. Sensitivity analysis was conducted alternately assuming (a) 5% and 10% discount rate; and (b) global life expectancy of 72 years, and the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years. Findings: The 20,453 human lives lost due to COVID-19 had a total DMVHL of Int$ 9,629,234,112, and an average of Int$ 470,798 per human life lost. Alternate re-estimation of the economic model with a 5% and 10% discount rates led to 19.8% and 47.4% reductions in the DMVHL, respectively. Re-calculation of the economic model using the global life expectancy of 72 years, while holding the discount rate constant at 3%, diminished the DMVHL by 41%. While the re-run of the same model using the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years instead, it increased the DMVHL by 18%. Research limitations/implications: The study omits the value of health systems inputs used in preventing, diagnosing and treating COVID-19 cases; and the negative impact of COVID-19 on the agriculture, education, finance, manufacturing, travel, tourism, and trade sectors. Social implications: There is a need to use this kind of evidence to advocate for increased investments into the strengthening of the national health system, IHR capacities, and coverage of safe water and sanitation facilities. Originality/value: In Spain, no other study had attempted to estimate the net present value of human lives lost from COVID-19.","Kirigia, Joses Muthuri; Muthuri, Rose Nabi Deborah Karimi",J.

316788,Neurosurgery at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: experience from a Surabaya academic tertiary hospital,2020,"Groundwater can be a key water resource in urban environments, providing a source of freshwater for community needs. The City of Guelph relies on groundwater for a population of over 130,000 people. Thus, groundwater quality is a critical component of long-term water management. This study assesses the effect of urban, industrial and agriculture activities on groundwater quality using a suite of multidisciplinary methods including geological, hydrological, geochemical, and isotopic tools. Multi-level systems (with depth-discrete ports), conventional well clusters, and municipal production wells were used to monitor hydraulic head and collect groundwater samples. Geochemical and isotopic measurements included redox parameters, major anions and cations, VOC, tritium and Î´34S and Î´18O in sulfate. Hydraulic head data show vertical gradient profiles characteristic of a multi-layered flow system within a shallow and deep Silurian bedrock aquifer and an intermediate aquitard varying in occurrence. Head loss disappears near production wells, showing enhanced vertical hydraulic connectivity between shallow and deep aquifers, attributed to pumping and long open intervals. Hydrochemical data show no impact of nitrate and high chloride is observed in the shallow and deep aquifer, attributed to seasonal road salt and the underlying aquitard unit, respectively. The aquitard unit also control the high sulfate in the deep aquifer which is supported by the isotope data on sulfate. Facilitated transport of shallow groundwater into the deeper aquifer is supported by the tritium data, showing the presence of recent groundwater throughout the whole depth of the two aquifers in some areas, likely due to the varying aquitard presence and enhanced vertical flow due to proximity from pumping municipal wells and active rock quarry. The results of this research suggest long term implications for groundwater resource management of sedimentary bedrock aquifers, where there is increasing groundwater demand due to population growth and potential for continual water quality degradation.","Nunes, M A; Aravena, R; Parker, B L",Sci Total Environ,,614

319517,Changes That Have Occurred in the Surgical Treatment Preference for Non-emergent Kidney Stones During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Six Months of Clinical Experience in A Tertiary Referral Centre,2021,"Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a ß-galactoside-binding lectin capable of promoting or suppressing the progression of infectious diseases. This protein is susceptible to cleavage of its linker-peptides by several proteases, and the resulting cleaved forms, N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and C-terminal CRD, bind to various glycans. It has been suggested that full-length (FL)-Gal-9 and the truncated (Tr)-Gal-9s could exert different functions from one another via their different glycan-binding activities. We propose that FL-Gal-9 regulates the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, HIV co-infected with opportunistic infection (HIV/OI), dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis (TB). We also suggest that the blood levels of FL-Gal-9 reflect the severity of dengue, malaria, and HIV/OI, and those of Tr-Gal-9 markedly reflect the severity of HIV/OI. Recently, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was suggested to be an indicator of respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as useful for differentiating pulmonary from extrapulmonary TB. The protease cleavage of FL-Gal-9 may lead to uncontrolled hyper-immune activation, including a cytokine storm. In summary, Gal-9 has potential to reflect the disease severity for the acute and chronic infectious diseases.","Iwasaki-Hozumi, Hiroko; Chagan-Yasutan, Haorile; Ashino, Yugo; Hattori, Toshio",Biomolecules,,614
319710,Covid-19 and diet: an evaluation of information available on internet in Italy,2021,"Policy Points Reflecting on current response deficiencies, we offer a model for a national contingency supply chain cell (NCSCC) construct to manage the medical materials supply chain in support of emergencies, such as COVID-19. We develop the following: a framework for governance and response to enable a globally independent supply chain; a flexible structure to accommodate the requirements of state and county health systems for receiving and distributing materials; and a national material ""control tower"" to improve transparency and real-time access to material status and location. CONTEXT: Much of the discussion about the failure of the COVID-19 supply chain has centered on personal protective equipment (PPE) and the degree of vulnerability of care. Prior research on supply chain risks have focused on mitigating the risk of disruptions of specific purchased materials within a bounded region or on the shifting status of cross-border export restrictions. But COVID-19 has impacted every purchase category, region, and border. This paper is responsive to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommendation to study and monitor disasters and to provide governments with course of action to satisfy legislative mandates. METHODS: Our analysis draws on our observations of the responses to COVID-19 in regard to acquisition and contracting problem-solving, our review of field discussions and interactions with experts, a critique of existing proposals for managing the strategic national stockpile in the United States a mapping of the responses to national contingency planning phases, and the identification of gaps in current national healthcare response policy frameworks and proposals. FINDINGS: Current proposals call for augmenting a system that has failed to deliver the needed response to COVID-19. These proposals do not address the key attributes for pandemic plan renewal: flexibility, traceability and transparency, persistence and responsiveness, global independence, and equitable access. We offer a commons-based framework for achieving the opportunities and risks which are responsive to a constellation of intelligence assets working in and across focal targets of global supply chain risk. CONCLUSIONS: The United States needs a ""commons-based strategy"" that is not simply a stockpile repository but instead is a network of repositories, fluid inventories, and analytic monitoring governed by the experts. We need a coordinated effort, a ""commons"" that will direct both conventional and new suppliers to meet demands and to eliminate hoarding and other behaviors.","Handfield, Robert; Finkenstadt, Daniel Joseph; Schneller, Eugene S; Godfrey, A Blanton; Guinto, Peter",Milbank Q,,614

AIM: To explore bereaved relatives' experiences of quality of care and family support provided during the last days of life; to identify the impact of factors associated with perceived support. DESIGN: A national, observational, open online survey was developed and disseminated via social media, public fora and professional networks (June-September 2020). Validated instruments and purposively designed questions assessed experiences. Analysis used descriptive statistics, logistic regression and thematic analysis of free-text responses. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals (â©¾18 years) who had experienced the death of a relative/friend (all care settings) within the United Kingdome during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 278, mean 53.4 years) tended to be female (n = 216, 78%); over half were 'son/daughter' (174, 62.6%) to the deceased. Deceased individuals (mean 81.6 years) most frequently died in their 'usual place of care' (n = 192, 69.3%). Analysis established five conceptual themes affecting individualised care: (1) public health restrictions compounding the distress of 'not knowing'; (2) disparate views about support from doctors and nurses; (3) challenges in communication and level of preparedness for the death; (4) delivery of compassionate care; (5) emotional needs and potential impact on grief. Male respondents (OR 2.9, p = 0.03) and those able to visit (OR 2.2, p = 0.04) were independently associated with good perceptions of family support. CONCLUSION: Despite public health restrictions, individualised care can be enabled by proactive, informative communication; recognising dying in a timely manner and facilitating the ability to be present before death.","Mayland, Catriona R; Hughes, Rosemary; Lane, Steven; McGlinchey, Tamsin; Donnellan, Warren; Bennett, Kate; Hanna, Jeffrey; Rapa, Elizabeth; Dalton, Louise; Mason, Stephen R",Palliat Med,,614

321220,Real-world impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assessment of anaesthesiology residents,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Emergency measures to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and contain the outbreak is the main priority in each of our hospitals; however, these measures are likely to result in collateral damage among patients with other acute diseases. Here, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects acute stroke care through interruptions in the stroke chain of survival. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of acute stroke care activity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak is given for a stroke network in southern Europe. To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region. RESULTS: Following confinement of the population, our stroke unit activity decreased sharply, with a 25% reduction in admitted cases (mean number of 58 cases every 15 days in previous months to 44 cases in the 15 days after the outbreak, P<0.001). Consultations to the telestroke network declined from 25 every 15 days before the outbreak to 7 after the outbreak (P<0.001). The increasing trend in the prehospital diagnosis of stroke activated by 911 calls stopped abruptly in the region, regressing to 2019 levels. The mean number of stroke codes dispatched to hospitals decreased (78% versus 57%, P<0.001). Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed >30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive for acute stroke pathways. Bottlenecks in the access and delivery of patients to our secured stroke centers are among the main challenges. It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.","Montaner, Joan; Barragán-Prieto, Ana; Pérez-Sánchez, Soledad; Escudero-Martínez, Irene; Moniche, Francisco; Sánchez-Miura, José Antonio; Ruiz-Bayo, Lidia; González, Alejandro",Stroke,,614

Glucocorticoids and azithromycin are drugs that may be effective in the treatment. This review aims to highlight the clinical findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid and azithromycin therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. To date, many drugs have been studied for use in combination therapy, and the rapid expansion of knowledge about the virology of SARS-CoV-2 generates a more accurate direction in therapy.","de Lemos Neto, Miguel; Alexandre, Rafael Costa Vieira; Morra, Rafaela Oliveira Gallart; da Paz, Juliana Aparecida Souza; Barroso, Shana Priscila Coutinho; Resende, Angela Castro; de Medeiros-Lima, Daniel J M; Alexandre, Pedro Celso Braga",Pharmacol. rep,,614
321749,COVID-19 in children and young people,2020,"Background-The COVID-19 restrictions curtailed various physical activities whose effects are unfortunate because daily exercise may help combat the disease by boosting our immune systems and counteracting some of the co-morbidities that make us more susceptible to severe COVID-19 illness. Objectives-To study the physical activity behaviour, levels and its relationship with personal variables during COVID 19 lockdown, and to explore the differences between the inactive and active group respondents in terms of physical activity preferences, motivating and restricting factors. Materials and Methods-Cross sectional descriptive online survey (google forms) design was used and snowball sampling method was used to reach the respondents. Questionnaire consisted of four parts;1) Demographics, 2) Occupation, Screen and Sleep behaviour, 3) Physical Activity behaviour, 4) Preferred physical activities, restricting and motivating factors to do any physical activity. To study the TPA OPA, MV-LTPA and HHPA were considered. Results and Discussion-A total of 400 respondents (male 56.2, female 43.2%)) were eligible for the analysis, majority (93.6%) of them were young adults (18-38) involved in sedentary to light occupation (95.3%).Sedentary behavior in occupation was doubled (80%) as compared to pre COVID situation (42.5%). Majority of the respondents reported an increase in screen and sleep time. On calculating TPA ~33% of the respondents were found in each group;inactive, active and very active. Majority of them were performing pa for &lt;150m/w in each domain i.e. OPA, MV-LTPA and HHPA. Significant difference was found between male and female, of all the three domains, in their physical activity group whereas no significant difference was found in their TPA group. Significant association was found between physical activity groups in terms of considering physical activity benefits, change in post COVID physical activity, and their self reported type of physical activity. Significant association was found between male and female respondents in terms of their BMI and perceived Body weight whereas no association was found between physical activity groups in terms of their BMI and body weight perception. Family/friends and health benefits were the most motivating factors for the majority of respondents whereas social distancing norms and lack of motivation were reported as restricting factors in doing physical activity. Conclusion-It can be concluded that physical activity among people was low even before the COVID-19 pandemic, this pandemic acted as a catalyst in promoting sedentary behavior.","Sijwali, S.; Chauhan, A.",Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development,,614

The pandemic has changed how individuals live and work, and in particular, frontline healthcare professionals have been exposed to alarming levels of stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand the professional and personal effects of COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons working in the UK National Health Service (NHS). SETTING: Surgical departments in the NHS. DESIGN: Between May and July 2020, as part of an ongoing study, we asked surgeons two open-ended questions: 'What challenges are the COVID-19 crisis currently presenting to you in your work and home life?' and 'How is this stress affecting you personally?' Thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data. Responses to the second question were also categorised into four groups reflecting valence: positive, neutral, mildly negative and strongly negative. RESULTS: A total of 141 surgeons responded to the survey and the results indicated that 85.8% reported that they were generally negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 7.8% were strongly affected in a negative way. Qualitative thematic analysis identified four key themes from responses relating to the impact of the pandemic: (1) changing and challenging work environment as a result of COVID-19; (2) challenges to professional life and development; (3) management of change and loss in the respondents' personal lives; (4) emotional and psychological impacts. CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the substantial emotional and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgeons' mental health, particularly in relation to fear and anxiety, loss of motivation, low mood, stress and burnout. There is an urgent need for workplace support and mental health interventions to help surgeons cope with the difficulties they face during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-Ghunaim, Tmam Abdulaziz; Johnson, Judith; Biyani, Chandra Shekhar; O039,; Connor, Daryl",BMJ Open,,614

322728,Utility of Simulation via Instant Messaging - Birmingham Advance (SIMBA) in medical education during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The transmission dynamics of the coronavirus-COVID-19-have challenged humankind at almost every level. Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a 'medium' (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.","Gomez, Jonatan; Prieto, Jeisson; Leon, Elizabeth; Rodríguez, Arles",PLoS One,,614
322817,ActiGraph and Short-term Heart Rate Variability Study Protocol: Amended for the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Proximal gastric vagotomy has been accepted as the procedure of choice for the elective surgical treatment of chronic duodenal ulcers, being the safest operation when considering morbidity and mortality. Its application has been extended to duodenal to complicated ulcer means of a complementary operation aiming to solve the complication. With the aim of evaluating the proximal gastric vagotomy in the treatment of stenosing duodenal ulcers the clinical results of 80 consecutive patients treated with proximal gastric vagotomy plus vagotomy (VGP + Dp) were compared to those of a series of 106 patients submitted to selective gastric vagotomy plus antrectomy (VGS + A). These patients were evaluated for a period of 2 to 16 years after surgery. The series were homogeneous related in gender and age. Five different types of duodenoplast were performed, according to anatomic characteristics of the stenosed duodenum. In the VGS + A group the reconstruction of alimentary tract was gastroduodenal in 46 patients and gastrojejunal in 60 patients. Post operative endoscopic control showed patency of the duodenal lumen and preserved pyloric sphincter in the patients submitted to duodenoplaty. Ulcer recurrence ocurred in 5% after VGP + Dp and in 1,9% after VGS + A. Late postoperative complications such as diarrhea dumping and bilious vomiting were more frequent and more severe among the patients treated with VGS + A. Bilious vomiting did not occur and dumping and diarrhea were rare, mild and transitory after VGP + Dp. The overall clinical assessment, according to Visick classification, showed excelent results in 73% of the patients with VGP + Dp and in 42% of the patients with VGS + A; excelent and good result were found in 87% of the patients of the first group and in 76% of the second group. The better performance of proximal gastric vagotomy, with less frequent side effects and milder and transitory late complications, turns 5% to 10% ulcer recurrence tolerable and makes it acceptable as the operation of choice for the treatment of uncomplicated chronic duodenal ulcer.","Ceneviva, R.; S. dos Santos, J.; de C.

The current Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. RESULTS: One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour. Adjusted for the type of accommodation food seeking behaviour and irritability is increased to a significantly lesser extent in people with PWS accommodated in specialised care facilities compared with those living in their family home. No significant difference could be found between the sexes. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food-seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care. Individuals living with their families were particularly vulnerable, indicating that they and their families are in special need of support.","Wieting, J; Eberlein, C; Bleich, S; Frieling, H; Deest, M",J. intellect. dis. res,,614

324481,Spinal surgery during the covid-19 pandemic: The experience in a tertiary referral centre,2021,"Severe Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) can cause serious lung inflammation and death. COVID-19 is characterized by a high mortality rate. This severity is associated with the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines called ""cytokine storms"". One of the cytokines that play a central role is Interleukin-6 (IL-6). High IL-6 levels are associated with mortality. Expectedly, the IL-6 blockade could reduce cytokine storms and thus reduce deaths in severe COVID-19 patients. This systematic review aimed to summarize the comparison between mortality using anti-IL-6 therapy and mortality using standard treatment in severe COVID-19 patients. We systematically searched the PubMed, ScienceDirect, and ProQuest databases until 13 August 2020. After screening, twelve studies matched the inclusion criteria. The mortality of the anti-IL-6 therapy group was lower than the standard treatment group without anti-IL-6 therapy in COVID-19 patients in 10 of the 12 studies obtained. Four of the ten studies statistically found a significant difference in mortality of the anti-IL-6 therapy group and the standard treatment group. Confirmation of anti-IL-6 therapy effectiveness in reducing mortality in severe COVID-19 patients will require randomized controlled trials.

We sought to understand its effects on vascular surgery practices stratified by VASCON surgical readiness level and determine how these effects have changed during the course of the pandemic. METHODS: All members of the Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Society were sent electronic surveys questioning the effects of COVID-19 on their practices in the early pandemic in April (EP) and four months later in the pandemic in August (LP) 2020. RESULTS: Response rates were 206/731 (28%) in the EP group and 108/731 (15%) in the LP group (P < 0.0001). Most EP respondents reported VASCON levels less than 3 (168/206,82%), indicating increased hospital limitations while 6/108 (6%) in the LP group reported this level (P < 0.0001). The EP group was more likely to report a lower VASCON level (increased resource limitations), and decreased clinic, hospital and emergency room consults. Despite an increase of average cases/week to pre-COVID-19 levels, 46/108 (43%) of LP report continued decreased compensation, with 57% reporting more than 10% decrease. Respondents in the decreased compensation group were more likely to have reported a VASCON level 3 or lower earlier in the pandemic (Pâ¯=â¯0.018). 91/108(84%) of LP group have treated COVID-19 patients for thromboembolic events, most commonly acute limb ischemia (76/108) and acute DVT (76/108). While the majority of respondents are no longer delaying the vascular surgery cases, 76/108 (70%) feel that vascular patient care has suffered due to earlier delays, and 36/108 (33%) report a backlog of cases caused by the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a profound effect on vascular surgery practices earlier in the pandemic, resulting in continued detrimental effects on the provision of vascular care as well as compensation received by vascular surgeons.","Bath, Jonathan; Aziz, Faisal; Smeds, Matthew R",Ann. vasc. surg,,614

Video consultations were introduced in March 2020, and this article presents the experiences gained by healthcare professionals and patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data was collected in June 2020 through focus-group interviews with healthcare professionals and through an anonymous online survey of patients who had attended video consultations during a period of three weeks in June 2020. RESULTS: The data from the focus-group interviews with seven rheumatologists and seven nurses were sorted into main thematic categories: patient, healthcare professional, consultation, and technology. The healthcare professionals felt that video consultations, with some exceptions, were appropriate in the follow-up of patients with rheumatic diseases, and especially for stable patients with no confounding issues. Of the 383 patients who were invited to participate, 139 (36 %) responded to the survey. The patients were largely satisfied with the video consultation, with a median score of 10 (quartiles 8-10) on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, however, 32 (27 %) patients considered the lack of clinical examination to be detrimental. INTERPRETATION: Video consultations are often appropriate in the follow-up of patients with a rheumatic disease.","Tveter, Anne Therese; Provan, Sella Aarrestad; Moholt, Ellen; Bergsmark, Kjetil; Østerås, Nina",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,,614

326414,How are OCD Patients and Family Members Dealing with the Waxing and Waning Pattern of the COVID-19 Pandemic? Results of a Longitudinal Observational Study,2021,"PURPOSE: First, to describe adolescents' health information sources and knowledge, health literacy (HL), health protective measures, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway. Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. METHODS: This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16-19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. CONCLUSION: Adolescents follow the health authorities' guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents' HRQoL.","Riiser, Kirsti; Helseth, Sølvi; Haraldstad, Kristin; Torbjørnsen, Astrid; Richardsen, Kåre Rønn",PLoS One,,614

327207,P.96 Development of effective and safe virtual pre-operative assessment during the Covid-19 pandemic through utilisation of telemedicine: a quality improvement project in a stand-alone maternity hospital,2021,"The objective in cancer radiotherapy is to maximize tumor-kill while limiting toxic effects of radiation dose on nearby organs-at-risk. Given a fixed number of treatment sessions, planners thus face the problem of finding a dosing sequence that achieves this goal. This is called the fractionation problem, and has received steady attention over a long history in the clinical literature. Mathematical formulations of the resulting optimization problem utilize the linear-quadratic (LQ) framework to characterize radiation dose-response of tumors and OAR. This yields a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program. The optimal dosing plan in this forward problem crucially depends on the parameters of the LQ model. Unfortunately, these parameters are difficult to estimate via {it{in vitro}} or {it{in vivo}} studies, and as such, their values are unknown to treatment planners. The clinical literature is thus replete with debates about what parameter values will make specific dosing plans effective. This manuscript formulates this as an inverse optimization problem. The LQ dose-response parameters appear in the objective function, the left hand side, and the right hand side of the forward problem, and none of the existing generic methods can provide an exact solution of the inverse problem. This manuscript exploits the structure of the problem and identifies all possible parameter values that render the given dosing plan optimal, in closed-form. This closed-form formula is applied to dosing-plans from three clinical studies published within the last two years.","Ghate, Archis",Phys. med. biol,,614

Vitamin D in psychiatric inpatients,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has been associated with increased risk of thrombosis, heparin resistance and coagulopathy in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care. We report the incidence of thrombotic and bleeding events in a single center cohort of 30 consecutive patients with COVID-19 supported by veno-venous extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO) and who had a whole body Computed Tomography Scanner (CT) on admission. METHODOLOGY: All patients were initially admitted to other hospitals and later assessed and retrieved by our ECMO team. ECMO was initiated in the referral center and all patients admitted through our CT scan before settling in our intensive care unit. Clinical management was guided by our institutional ECMO guidelines, established since 2011 and applied to at least 40 patients every year. RESULTS: We diagnosed a thrombotic event in 13 patients on the initial CT scan. Two of these 13 patients subsequently developed further thrombotic complications. Five of those 13 patients had a subsequent clinically significant major bleeding. In addition, two patients presented with isolated intracranial bleeds. Of the 11 patients who did not have baseline thrombotic events, one had a subsequent oropharyngeal hemorrhage. When analyzed by ROC analysis, the area under the curve for % time in intended anticoagulation range did not predict thrombosis or bleeding during the ECMO run (0.36 (95% CI 0.10-0.62); and 0.51 (95% CI 0.25-0.78); respectively). CONCLUSION: We observed a high prevalence of VTE and a significant number of hemorrhages in these severely ill patients with COVID-19 requiring veno-venous ECMO support.","Ripoll, Brianda; Rubino, Antonio; Besser, Martin; Patvardhan, Chinmay; Thomas, William; Sheares, Karen; Shanahan, Hilary; Agrawal, Bobby; Webb, Stephen; Vuylsteke, Alain",Int J Artif Organs,,614
331126,The Prevalence and Determinants of Hand and Face Dermatitis during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Population-Based Survey,2020,"Since the emergence of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its spread as a pandemic, media was teeming with misinformation that led to psychologic, social and economic consequences among the global public. Probing knowledge and anxiety regarding this novel infectious disease is necessary to identify gaps in knowledge and sources of misinformation which can help public health efforts to design and implement more focused interventional measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and effects of misinformation about COVID-19 on anxiety level among the general public residing in Jordan. This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based questionnaire that took place in April 2020, which targeted people residing in Jordan, aged 18 and above. The questionnaire included items on the following: demographic characteristics of the participants, knowledge about COVID-19, anxiety level and misconceptions regarding the origin of the pandemic. The total number of participants included in final analysis was 3150. The study population was predominantly females (76.0%), with mean age of 31 years. The overall knowledge of COVID-19 was satisfactory. Older age, males, lower monthly income and educational levels, smoking and history of chronic disease were associated with perceiving COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease. Variables that were associated with a higher anxiety level during the pandemic included: lower monthly income and educational level, residence outside the capital (Amman) and history of smoking. Misinformation about the origin of the pandemic (being part of a conspiracy, biologic warfare and the 5G networks role) was also associated with higher anxiety levels. Social media platforms, TV and news releases were the most common sources of information about the pandemic. The study showed the potential harmful effects of misinformation on the general public and emphasized the need to meticulously deliver timely and accurate information about the pandemic to lessen the health, social and psychological impact of the disease.","Sallam, Malik; Dababseh, Deema; Yaseen, Alaa; Al-Haidar, Ayat; Taim, Duaa; Eid, Huda; Ababneh, Nidaa A; Bakri, Faris G; Mahafzah, Azmi",PLoS One,,614

COVID-19 can manifest with cardiac and thrombotic presentations. Additionally, patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at an increased risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 infection. This in turn has led to a significant reduction in the provision of cardiac surgery with alternative management options utilized to address patients with significant disease. In terms of aortic valve disease, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) provides advantages over surgical aortic valve replacement in with a lower burden on healthcare resources. COVID-19 also resulted in changes in management strategies and as such TAVI is now being considered in younger- and low-risk patients. However, long term data with regard to TAVI is still unknown, and the use in patient groups that have been excluded in the large pivotal studies that established TAVI as an alternative to surgery has raised specific concerns in the use of TAVI as the preferred treatment choice. With the long term ramification unknown, it is essential that decisions are made with caution.","Shafi, Ahmed M A; Awad, Wael I",J Card Surg,,614

332954,Cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescents before and after the COVID-19 confinement: a prospective cohort study,2021,"The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic on March 12, 2020. Within 3-1/2 months since outbreak in December 2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected across 206 countries with over 70,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60-140nm with mean size of the nano-aerosols, 100nm. The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95 and N98 at 300nm, to-date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture the deadly airborne coronavirus with our target set at 100nm (nano-aerosol), and not 300nm. The virus and its attached particle were simulated by sodium chloride aerosols, 50-500nm, generated from sub-micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers were produced with fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525nm with excellent morphology. The fibers were subsequently charged by corona discharge. The amounts of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90% for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency and concurrently much higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the efficiency-to-pressure-drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules, each separated by a permeable scrim material, the electrical interference was reduced, if not fully mitigated. Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter that further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amount of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer performance without incurring higher pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, and nano-aerosols from air pollution which lead to chronic diseases.","Woon Fong Leung, Wallace; Sun, Qiangqiang",Sep Purif Technol,,614

The survey attempted to retrospectively assess all self-reported or diagnosed cases of influenza since August 1, 1918. It indicated that the cumulative incidence of symptomatic influenza over 6 months had been 29.4% (range = 15% in Louisville, KY, to 53.3% in San Antonio, TX). The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.70%, and it ranged from 0.78% in San Antonio to 3.14% in New London, Connecticut. Localities with high cumulative incidence were not necessarily those with high CFR.

Although the value of acceptance tests and integration tests increasingly depends on the integrity of the underlying data, models, and pipelines, software development and data management organizations have traditionally been siloed and quality assurance practice is not as mature in data operations as it is for software. Companies that close this gap by developing cross-organizational systems will create new competitive advantage and differentiation. By taking a more holistic view of testing that crosses these boundaries, practitioners can help their organizations close the gap.","Radziwill, Nicole; Freeman, Graham",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00655v1.pdf,614
335902,The burden of proximal femur fractures and other skeletal injuries during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown: a retrospective comparative study,2020,"Despite increasing research interest in big data analytics, exploring its important role in implementing supply chain management practices in healthcare organisations is still one of the major challenges for both academics and practitioners We propose a research model theoretically grounded on organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to investigate the roles of big data analytics capability (BDAC) in developing hospital supply chain integration (SCI) and operational flexibility The results from our analysis of survey data from a sample of 105 senior executives from the Chinese hospitals reveal that BDAC has a significant impact on three dimensions of hospital SCI: inter-functional integration, hospital-patient integration, and hospital-supplier integration;and that hospital-patient integration and hospital-supplier integration fully mediate the relationship between inter-functional integration and operational flexibility These findings extend and validate OIPT within the context of big data-driven hospital supply chains, while also providing useful and timely guidance to healthcare practitioners in developing data-driven SCI for better operational flexibility, especially to respond to the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak","Yu, Wantao Zhao Gen Liu Qi Song Yongtao",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,,614

337263,The risk of suicide in healthcare workers in nursing home: An exploratory analysis during COVID-19 epidemic,2021,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.","Zhou, Wei Ke; Wang, Ai Li; Xia, Fan; Xiao, Yan Ni; Tang, San Yi",Math Biosci Eng,,614

The spike protein of this virus and the angiotensin-converter enzyme (ACE)-2 in host cells in humans play a vital role in infection and in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Estradiol is known to modulate the actions of immune cells, and, therefore, the antiviral mechanisms of these cells could also be modified by this hormone stimulus. Even though estradiol is not considered a protective factor, evidence shows that women with high levels of this hormone have a lower risk of developing severe symptoms and an even a lower incidence of death. Understanding the mechanism of action of estradiol with regard to viral infections and COVID-19 is essential for the improvement of therapeutic strategies. This review aims to describe the effects that estradiol exerts on immune cells during viral infections and COVID-19.","Ramírez-de-Arellano, Adrián; Gutiérrez-Franco, Jorge; Sierra-Diaz, Erick; Pereira-Suárez, Ana Laura",Hormones (Athens),,614

339668,Recommendations from national regulatory agencies for ongoing cancer trials during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Since February 2020, a large number of patients infected with new coronavirus has been cured and discharged with the controlling of epidemic. Pulmonary fibrosis, which may be one of the sequela caused by COVID-19, not only brings dyspnea and deterioration of lung function, but also affects patients' life because of its high mortality and poor prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(VEGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor(FGFR) can inhibit the proliferation, activation and migration of fibroblasts by regulating the signal transduction pathway involved in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. Chinese herbal formulas pose a good therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis. Present study explores the intervention effect on pulmonary fibrosis of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) by screening the potential inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR. The docking models of VEGFR and FGFR were established to obtain the potential active ingredients which were filtered by the docking score. According to 2 prescriptions in the Protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019(7th edition)and 9 prescriptions in Traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for treating blight, 959 and 1 047 potential ingredients were obtained as the inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR respectively with the screening thres-hold set as eighty percent of the docking score of the initial ligands. The potential herbs were then filtered by the components with a hit rate higher than 30%, such as Scutellariae Radix, Adenophorae Radix, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Coicis Semen, etc. To discuss the rule of TCM in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, the networks of TCM-channel tropism and TCM-efficacy of the potential herbs was constructed. The potential herbs for treating pulmonary fibrosis mostly belong to lung(degree=14) and spleen(degree value=8), and the efficacy is focused on reinforcing deficiency(degree=9). Qiyin Prescription and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction contain the largest number of the potential herbs. The main symptom of COVID-19 is damp-heat stagnating in the lung, which always causes impairment of body fluid and Qi. Clinical observation shows that patients in the recovery period are mostly at the status that the remaining virus toxicity is not exhausted while the vital Qi have not recovered. The results of this study are expected to provide references for clinical medication in preventing and treating pulmonary fibrosis caused by COVID-19.","Bian, Ya-Qian; Ma, Jing; Ren, Yue; Zhang, Yan-Ling; Qiao, Yan-Jiang",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,614

Two cases were pubic symphysis diastasis, 15 were anterior ring fracture (7 were bilateral), and 1 was vertical displacement of pubic symphysis associated with pubic ramus fracture. According to Tile classification, 8, 4, and 6 cases were types C1, C2, and C3, respectively. All patients accepted the operation of pelvic fractures on both rings, while the anterior ring injuries were treated with minimally invasive internal fixation. The period from injury to operation was 5 to 32 days (11.2â±â3.7). Four patients had pubic symphysis diastasis or pelvic anterior ring fracture medial obturator foramen reduced with modified Pfannenstiel incision and fixed with cannulated screws, 14 patients (22 fractures) had a fractured lateral obturator foramen reduced with modified Pfannenstiel incision associated with small iliac crest incision and fixed with locking reconstruction plates. Clinical data, such as operation time, intraoperative bleeding, Matta standard to assess the reduction quality of fracture, and complications, were collected and analyzed.The operation time ranged from 30 to 65 minutes (42.8â±â18.7), and the intraoperative bleeding volume was 30 to 150 mL (66.5â±â22.8). All cases were continuously followed-up for 16 to 42 months (30.2â±â4.6). All fractures were healed between 3 and 9 months postoperatively (4.9â±â2.7 months). According to the Matta standard assessment, 18, 7, and 1 cases were excellent, good, and fair, respectively, with a 96.2% (25/26) rate of satisfaction. Neither reduction loss, fixation failure, nor infection occurred; complications included 1 patient with fatal liquefaction, 1 patient had lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injury, and 1 patient complained of discomfort in the inguinal area due to fixation stimulation.Minimally invasive internal fixation for pelvic anterior ring injury in Tile C pelvic fracture has the advantages of less damage, safer manipulation, less complications, and good prognosis.","Sun, Xiaochen; Yan, Huimin; Wang, Jianmin; Liu, Zhaojie; Tian, Wei; Jia, Jian",Medicine (Baltimore),,614

The angular arrangement of M, S and R atoms with â (R-S...M) down to 150° was a common feature of the late transition metal complexes exhibiting shortened R-S...M contacts. Several model nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II) and gold(I) complexes were chosen for a theoretical analysis of R-S...M interactions using the DFT method applied to (equilibrium) isolated systems. A combination of the real-space approaches, such as Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), noncovalent interaction index (NCI), electron localization function (ELF) and Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA), and orbital (Natural Bond Orbitals, NBO) methods was used to provide insights into the nature and energetics of R-S...M interactions with respect to the metal atom identity and its coordination environment. The explored features of the R-S...M interactions support the trends observed by inspecting the CSD statistics, and indicate a predominant contribution of semicoordination bonds between nucleophilic sites of the sulfur atom and electrophilic sites of the metal. A contribution of chalcogen bonding (that is formally opposite to semicoordination) was also recognized, although it was significantly smaller in magnitude. The analysis of R-S...M interaction strengths was performed and the structure-directing role of the intramolecular R-S...M interactions in stabilizing certain conformations of metal complexes was revealed.","Ananyev, Ivan V; Bokach, Nadezhda A; Kukushkin, Vadim Yu",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,614

Methods: A bibliometric search was performed in PubMed®, Scopus and Web of Science, focusing on meta-analyses about COVID-2019 disease. Bibliometric and descriptive data for the included articles were extracted and the methodological quality of the included meta-analyses was evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews. Results: A total of 348 meta-analyses were considered eligible. The first meta-analysis about COVID-19 disease was published on February 26, 2020, and the number of meta-analyses has grown rapidly since then. Most of them were published in infectious disease and virology journals. The greatest number come from China, followed by the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom. On average, these meta-analyses included 23 studies and 15,200 participants. Overall quality was remarkably low, and only 8.9% of them could be considered as of high confidence level. Conclusion: Although well-designed meta-analyses about COVID-19 disease have already been published, the majority are of low quality. Thus, all stakeholders playing a role in COVID-19 deseases, including policy makers, researchers, publishers and journals, should prioritize well-designed meta-analyses, performed only when the background information seem suitable, and discouraging those of low quality or that use suboptimal methods.","Pires, Gabriel Natan; Bezerra, Andréia Gomes; Oliveira, Thainá Baenninger de; Chen, Samuel Fen I; Malfatti, Victor Davis Apostolakis; Mello, Victoria Feiner Ferreira de; Niyama, Alyne; Pinto, Vitor Luiz Selva; Andersen, Monica Levy; Tufik, Sergio",Einstein (Säo Paulo),,614

BACKGROUND: Healthcare systems worldwide experienced an influx of COVID-19 patients, especially in critical care. COVID-19 patients are at risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prone position ventilation is the standard of care for mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Prone maneuvers in and of itself are time-consuming and labor-intensive, posing additional risks to patients. APPROACH: Our academic medical center developed a travel proning team to address the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients with ARDS necessitating prone positioning. EVALUATION: Over a period of 30 days, 420 ICU patients were intubated, 131 had moderate to severe ARDS and underwent prone positioning. Patients were placed in prone position or returned to supine position more than 834 times over 38 days. At the highest point, 37 procedures were done in 24 hours. CONCLUSION: This quality initiative demonstrated that utilization of a traveling proning team provides efficiency in time to prone. Developing a travel prone team allowed for efficiency in time to prone, supported the ICU clinical teams, and enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, which is essential during times of crisis.","Wells, Celia; Zhang, Ziya; Huelskamp, Stephen; Hughes, Ellen; Aguila, Dorothy; Sevillano, Maria; Garrett, Lisa; Acquah, Samuel; Chan, Christy; Kohli-Seth, Roopa",J Nurs Adm,,614

This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrocolloid dressing combined with 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film on the prevention of facial pressure injury in medical staff tasked with preventing and controlling COVID-19. METHODS: This was a self-controlled study. Medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection in isolation wards from 6 January to 2 February, 2020, were selected to participate. Phase I was defined as the first 2 weeks of medical personnel entering the isolation ward, with phase II being the following 2 weeks. In phase I, medical workers only used hydrocolloid dressing on their faces, and in phase II, they used both hydrocolloid dressing and 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film. RESULTS: A total of 116 medical workers were selected as research subjects. The average facial local temperature in phase I was higher than that in phase II from the baseline (day 1) to the end of the study (day 14); however, there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). The incidence of facial pressure injury in phase II was lower than that in phase I (P<0.05); the facial skin comfort level among medical staff in phase II was higher than that in phase I (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocolloid dressing combined with 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film for facial skin care can effectively reduce the incidence of facial pressure injury and can improve skin comfort level while ensuring isolation and a protective effect.","Zhang, Shuanghong; Hu, Shidong; Chen, Hezhen; Jia, Xiaohui",Ann. palliat. med.

The Seattle Washington metropolitan area was one of the first in the United States affected by the pandemic. As a result, the anatomic pathology services at the University of Washington experienced significant changes in operational volumes early in the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of COVID-19 and both state and institutional policies implemented to mitigate viral transmission (including institutional policies on non-urgent procedures) on anatomic pathology volumes. DESIGN: Accessioned specimens from January 2020 to June 2020 was evaluated as COVID-19 and institutional policies changed. The data were considered in these contexts: subspecialty, billable CPT codes, and intraoperative consultation. Comparable data were retrieved from 2019 as a historical control. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall accessioned volume (up to 79%) from pre-pandemic levels, during bans on non-urgent procedures when compared to 2020 pre- COVID-19 volumes and historical controls. The gastrointestinal and dermatopathology services were most impacted, while breast and combined head&neck/pulmonary services were least impacted. CPT code 88305, for smaller/biopsy specimens, had a 63% reduction during non-urgent procedure bans. After all bans on procedures were lifted, the overall volume plateaued at 89% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease in specimen volume was most strongly associated with bans on non-urgent procedures. While all departmental areas had a decrease in volume, the extent of change varied across subspecialty and specimen types. Even with removing all bans, service volume did not reach pre-pandemic levels.","Miller, Timothy Isaac; Smith, Kelly D; Gonzalez-Cuyar, Luis Francisco; Swanson, Paul E",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,614
345567,Health-Related Behaviors Among School-Aged Children and Adolescents During the Spanish Covid-19 Confinement,2020,"Background: UK data suggest 6% of COVID-19 hospital admissions are either currently pregnant or immediately post-partum. However, the current literature suggests that if COVID-19 occurs in pregnancy, or post-partum, symptoms are mostly mild. Methods: All COVID-19 admissions to one acute London National Health Service Foundation trust were reviewed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to 1 May 2020 to establish whether there were any pregnant or immediately post-partum admissions. Data were extracted from hospital electronic records and anonymised. Any patients admitted to adult intensive care unit had their case notes reviewed in detail and comparison made to a local risk-assessment guideline identifying patients at-risk of thromboembolic events or cytokine storms. Local hospital guidelines were followed. Patients admitted to adult intensive care unit gave written consent. Results: A total of 24 pregnant or immediately post-partum patients with COVID-19 were admitted. Three patients required long adult intensive care unit admissions for severe single-organ respiratory failure after emergency C-sections. Two of these patients required proning (three times and eight times, respectively). All were considered medium risk for thromboembolic events but had rising D-dimers following adult intensive care unit admission, resulting in increased dosing of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis throughout their admission. All were considered low risk for a cytokine storm, and none had any significant cardiovascular or renal involvement. One patient developed a super-imposed fungal lung infection. All three patients developed delirium following cessation of sedation. Conclusion: Pregnant or immediately post-partum women can develop severe COVID-19 symptoms requiring prolonged adult intensive care unit admission. It is likely to be single-organ failure, but patients are at a high risk of a thromboembolic event and delirium.","Morton, Sarah; Lamont, Holly; Silvey, Natalie; Browning, Thomas; Hayes, Michelle; Keays, Richard; Christie, Linsey; Davies, Roger; Singh, Suveer; Lockie, Chris; Sisson, Alice; Vizcaychipi, Marcela",J.

COVID-19 is mainly manifested by respiratory symptoms,however, digestive manifestations have been reported, raising the hypothesis of the viral digestive tropism. AIMS: Specify the digestive manifestations due to the SARS-CoV-2, and their impact on the disease prognosis and describe the COVID-19 effect in patients with underlying digestive disease. METHODS: Ageneral review of the medical literature was conducted via Medline® database, through various combinations of the following keywords :SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gastrointestinal tract, digestive system, inflammatory bowel diseases, liver, liver injury, chronic liver disease, neoplasms. The most relevant articles were selected. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the digestive tract has been confirmed by the identification of the enterocyte as a target cell of the virus. Viral particles and RNA detection in stool of infected patients has raised the potential for feco-oral transmission of the virus. Gastrointestinal manifestations were frequent and may even be revealing or isolated. Diarrhea was the most characteristic symptom. Frequent liver involvement is associated with a more severe form of the disease. Patients with digestive cancer and chronic liver disease are at risk for a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: The clinician is required to know this type of manifestations in order to limit the delay in diagnosis and to better assess the prognosis.","Elloumi Kharrat, Hanen; Ghanem, Mohamed; Bouchabou, B; Bouali, Riadh; Elloumi, Héla",Tunis Med,,614

347079,Ignorance has turned the covid-19 into a social stigma,2021,"The outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March, 2020. In Hungary, the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 4th March, 2020, and on 15th March, the first fatality related to the infection was announced. At the moment of the latter event, there was no central, standardized guideline, which could explain the necessary precautions, and provide an unequivocal description on how to handle the dead body. The procedure of transportation, storage, occurent autopsy or final disposition of the deceased raise a lot of questions, especially on how to carry out these tasks. Legislation related to infectious diseases and decedent management in general do not provide enough information on how to perform duties in a COVID-19 fatality case. The chief medical officer suspended the execution of autopsies, except in cases of unnatural death, since 19th March, however, the transportation and storage of fatalities can still be a problem. The Department of Pathology of the Healthcare Professional College of the Ministry of Human capacities published a procedure on recommended post-mortem duties on 21st March, but the suggested protocols only represent a narrow spectrum of international recommendations. Therefore supplementation may be necessary. Sadly, post-mortem protocols, in spite of their importance, are also underrepresented in the international literature. A further problem, wich makes adoptability difficult, is that available foreign guidelines and algorithms are optimized for different legislation, and organisations, resources not available in our country. In this article, besides providing a summary of literature, we would also like to make practical recommendations which may increase the safety of healthcare providers participating in the treatment or pathological duties with COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.

347236,"All Hands on Deck: Learning to ""Un-specialize"" in the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020,"Background: A critical step in effective care and treatment planning for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the assessment of the severity of disease progression. Chest x-rays (CXRs) are often used to assess SARS-CoV-2 severity, with two important assessment metrics being extent of lung involvement and degree of opacity. In this proof-of-concept study, we assess the feasibility of computer-aided scoring of CXRs of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity using a deep learning system. Materials and Methods: Data consisted of 130 CXRs from SARS-CoV-2 positive patient cases from the Cohen study. Geographic extent and opacity extent were scored by two board-certified expert chest radiologists (with 20+ years of experience) and a 2nd-year radiology resident. The deep neural networks used in this study are based on a COVID-Net network architecture. 100 versions of the network were independently learned (50 to perform geographic extent scoring and 50 to perform opacity extent scoring) using random subsets of CXRs from the Cohen study, and evaluated the networks using stratified Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments. Findings: The deep neural networks yielded R$^2$ of 0.673 $\pm$ 0.004 and 0.636 $\pm$ 0.002 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively, in stratified Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments. The best performing networks achieved R$^2$ of 0.865 and 0.746 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively. Interpretation: The results are promising and suggest that the use of deep neural networks on CXRs could be an effective tool for computer-aided assessment of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity, although additional studies are needed before adoption for routine clinical use.","Wong, Alexander; Lin, Zhong Qiu; Wang, Linda; Chung, Audrey G.; Shen, Beiyi; Abbasi, Almas; Hoshmand-Kochi, Mahsa; Duong, Timothy Q.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12855v2.pdf,614

In this article, we describe the approach we followed to provide such demand forecasts, and we show how the use of analytics can provide relevant support for decision making, even with incomplete data and without enough time to fully explore the numerical properties of all available forecasting methods. The solution combines autoregressive, machine learning and epidemiological models to provide a short-term forecast of ICU utilization at the regional level. These forecasts were made publicly available and were actively used to support capacity planning. Our predictions achieved average forecasting errors of 4% and 9% for one- and two-week horizons, respectively, outperforming several other competing forecasting models.","Goic, Marcel; Bozanic-Leal, Mirko S; Badal, Magdalena; Basso, Leonardo J",PLoS One,,614

Objective: To elucidate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and symptom onset in a culturally linked community across 5 states in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included adults (aged &#8805;18 years) recruited from the orthodox Jewish community across 5 states (California, Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York) in 3 geographically distinct areas of the United States between May 13 and July 6, 2020. Participants completed an online survey and underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Seroprevalence and date of symptom onset of SARS-CoV-2. Results: Overall, 9507 adults (mean [SD] age, 39.6 [15.0] years; 3777 [39.7%] women) completed the SARS-CoV-2 survey, of whom 6665 (70.1%) had immunoglobin G anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels assessed. A high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was observed across all communities, with the highest proportion of positive testing observed in New Jersey (1080 of 3323 [32.5%]) and New York (671 of 2196 [30.6%]). Most individuals with a positive SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobin G antibody test reported a date of symptom-onset between March 9 and March 31, 2020 (California: 135 of 154 [87.7%]; Connecticut: 32 of 34 [94.1%]; Michigan: 44 of 50 [88.0%]; New Jersey: 964 of 1168 [82.5%]; New York: 571 of 677 [84.3%]).

Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study of orthodox Jewish adults across the US found that socioculturally bound communities experienced early parallel outbreaks in discrete locations, notably prior to substantive medical and governmental directives. Further research should clarify optimal national, local, community-based, and government policies to prevent outbreaks in social and cultural communities that traditionally gather for holidays, assemblies, and festivals.","Zyskind, Israel; Rosenberg, Avi Z; Zimmerman, Jason; Naiditch, Hiam; Glatt, Aaron E; Pinter, Abraham; Theel, Elitza S; Joyner, Michael J; Hill, D Ashley; Lieberman, Miriam R; Bigajer, Elliot; Stok, Daniel; Frank, Elliot; Silverberg, Jonathan I",JAMA Netw Open,,614
348254,Editorial. Endonasal neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: the Singapore perspective,2020,"Age is a major risk factor for severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscape of the aging human lung. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, we identify several factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is transcriptionally characterized by increased cell adhesion and stress responses, with reduced mitochondria and cellular replication. Deconvolution analysis reveals that the proportions of alveolar type 2 cells, proliferating basal cells, goblet cells, and proliferating natural killer/T cells decrease with age, whereas alveolar fibroblasts, pericytes, airway smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and IGSF21+ dendritic cells increase with age. Several age-associated genes directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Age-associated genes are also dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in patients with severe COVID-19. These analyses illuminate avenues for further studies on the relationship between age and COVID-19.","Chow, Ryan D; Majety, Medha; Chen, Sidi",Nat Commun,,614

Mortality estimates at the local level are even more uncertain as they require stringent conditions, such as granularity and accuracy of the data at hand, which are rarely met. The ""official"" approach adopted by public institutions to estimate the ""excess mortality"" during the pandemic draws on a comparison between observed all-cause mortality data for 2020 and averages of mortality figures in the past years for the same period. In this paper, we apply the recently developed machine learning control method to build a more realistic counterfactual scenario of mortality in the absence of COVID-19. We demonstrate that supervised machine learning techniques outperform the official method by substantially improving the prediction accuracy of the local mortality in ""ordinary"" years, especially in small- and medium-sized municipalities. We then apply the best-performing algorithms to derive estimates of local excess mortality for the period between February and September 2020. Such estimates allow us to provide insights about the demographic evolution of the first wave of the pandemic throughout the country.

351703,Racial Disparities in COVID-19 and Excess Mortality in Minnesota,2020,"Background & objectives: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread globally including India. The characteristic clinical observations and outcomes of this disease (COVID-19) have been reported from different countries. The present study was aimed to describe the clinico-demographic characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of a group of COVID-19 patients in north India. Methods: This was a prospective, single-centre collection of data regarding epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters, management and outcome of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care facility in north India. Patient outcomes were recorded as death, discharge and still admitted. Results: Data of 144 patients with COVID-19 were recorded and analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 40.1±13.1 yr, with 93.1 per cent males, and included 10 (6.9%) foreign nationals. Domestic travel to or from affected States (77.1%) and close contact with COVID-19 patients in congregations (82.6%) constituted the most commonly documented exposure. Nine (6.3%) patients were smokers, with a median smoking index of 200. Comorbidities were present in 23 (15.9%) patients, of which diabetes mellitus (n=16; 11.1%) was the most common. A significant proportion of patients had no symptoms (n=64; 44.4%); among the symptomatic, cough (34.7%) was the most common symptom followed by fever (17.4%) and nasal symptoms (2.15%). Majority of the patients were managed with supportive treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin given on a case-to-case basis. Only five (3.5%) patients required oxygen supplementation, four (2.8%) patients had severe disease requiring intensive care, one required mechanical ventilation and mortality occurred in two (1.4%) patients. The time to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity was 16-18 days. Interpretation & conclusions: In this single-centre study of 144 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in north India, the characteristic findings included younger age, high proportion of asymptomatic patients, long time to PCR negativity and low need for intensive care unit care.","Mohan, Anant; Tiwari, Pawan; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Patel, Ankit; Maurya, Abhishek; Dar, Lalit; Pahuja, Sourabh; Garg, Rakesh; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Sahoo, Biswajeet; Gupta, Ritu; Meena, Ved Prakash; Vig, Saurabh; Pandit, Anuja; Mittal, Saurabh; Madan, Karan; Hadda, Vijay; Dwivedi, Tanima; Choudhary, Aashish; Brijwal, Megha; Soneja, Manish; Guleria, Randeep; Ratre, Brajesh; Kumar, Balbir; Bhopale, Shweta; Panda, Smriti; Singh, Angel Rajan; Singh, Sheetal; Wundavalli, Laxmitej",Indian J Med Res,,614

352114,Child and Pet Care-Planning During COVID-19: Considerations for the Evolving Family Unit,2021,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiencies (NBS SCID) in 2010 was a significant public health milestone. While SCID was the primary target, several other conditions associated with severe T-cell lymphopenia (TCL) have subsequently been identified as secondary targets. The differential diagnosis in infants with an abnormal TREC result on NBS SCID who do not meet criteria for typical SCID is often broad, and often the evaluation of these conditions requires immunological and functional testing, in conjunction with genetic analysis, to obtain an accurate diagnosis and develop an appropriate management and treatment plan. OBJECTIVE: We describe here three infants identified by NBS SCID, who required additional work-up as they did not have a typical SCID phenotype and meet the relevant diagnostic criteria. Genetic testing identified pathogenic variants in ATM in all 3 patients, and the pathogenicity of the variants was confirmed by a functional flow cytometry assay. METHODS: The patients underwent immunological and genetic work-up to identify an underlying cause of their abnormal NBS SCID. AT was suspected based on clinical and family history, and immunological analyses. The diagnosis was confirmed in all patients with a rapid functional flow cytometric assay and genetic testing. RESULTS: A rapid functional flow cytometry assay was used as a diagnostic and confirmatory tool, in conjunction with genetic testing, to make a diagnosis of AT. Experimental validation of the causal relationship between genotype and phenotype allowed for expeditious diagnosis, which facilitated early discussions with families regarding prognosis, treatment, and management. CONCLUSION: Even with increased rapidity and access to genetic results, functional testing is required for clinical diagnosis in infants identified by NBS SCID who do not fit into the classic categories or have novel genetic variants to confirm the diagnosis. Consideration should be given to the use of functional assays as an essential component of an integrated evaluation to characterize the genetics and mechanisms of inborn errors of immunity.","Barmettler, Sara; Coffey, Kara; Smith, Matthew J; Chong, Hey Jin; Pozos, Tamara C; Seroogy, Christine M; Walter, Jolan; Abraham, Roshini S",J.

This study aims to inform clinical practice by 1) comparing and describing narrative retells in Swedish adolescents with and without ADHD, and 2) investigating the effects of picture support on narration in the two groups. Fifteen adolescents with ADHD and 31 with typical development (TD) participated. Two carefully matched narratives for retelling, one with and one without picture support were administered, transcribed, and analyzed regarding content and linguistic complexity (macro- and microlevel measures). The results showed that the ADHD group included less content than the TD group in both tasks, measured in fewer story grammar units and details. Both groups included more story grammar units in the task without picture support. The TD group had shorter retells with higher syntactic complexity in the task with picture support compared to the task without picture support. Compared to TD peers, retells without picture support from the ADHD group were significantly shorter and had a higher proportion of grammatical errors. These results show different strengths and weaknesses in the two groups and indicate that the narrative task without picture support, which places higher demands on EF, captured a linguistic vulnerability in the ADHD group. In conclusion, the choice of narrative task is important to consider in clinical practice to enable accurate descriptions of linguistic strengths and weaknesses in individuals with ADHD, and aid in differential diagnosis.","Bergman, Anna; Hallin, Anna Eva",Clin Linguist Phon,,614

We simultaneously detect and monitor as a function of time four breath biomarkers - CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, H$_2$O and HDO - as well as illustrating the feasibility of detecting at least six more (H$_2$CO, C$_2$H$_6$, OCS, C$_2$H$_4$, CS$_2$ and NH$_3$) without modifications to the experimental apparatus. We achieve ultra-high detection sensitivity at the parts-per-trillion level. This is made possible by the combination of the broadband spectral coverage of a frequency comb, the high spectral resolution afforded by the individual comb teeth, and the sensitivity enhancement resulting from a high-finesse cavity. Exploiting recent advances in frequency comb, optical coating, and photodetector technologies, we can access a large variety of biomarkers with strong carbon-hydrogen bond spectral signatures in the mid-IR.","Liang, Qizhong; Chan, Ya-Chu; Changala, P.

355536,Is it safe to restart elective day-case surgery? Lessons learned from upper limb ambulatory trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The purpose of this study is to uncover and optimize the structure and performance of the collaborative network that emerged in response to COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. This study reconstructed the Hubei Public Health Emergency Response Network as the actual collaborative network and built COVID-19 Collaborative Emergency Network as a planned task-oriented collaborative network. Based on the data sets of the inter-organizational collaboration collected from the content analysis, this study explored the core tasks of the participating actors and their relationships during the COVID-19 emergency response, and built six sub-networks to accomplish six core tasks. Network analysis was used with the Pajek software to compare the structural characteristics and performance of the planned network with the actual one and six sub-networks, and identified the central actors, key bridges, and brokers in networks and sub-networks separately. Findings suggested that COVID-19 Collaborative Emergency Network had a more tightly, central, and connective structure than Hubei Public Health Emergency Response Network, because it had more participating actors (i.e., databases and AI systems), more powerful and strong collaborative relationships with research institutions and non-profit organizations. With practical-based recommendations for inter-organizational collaboration, this study concluded that COVID-19 Collaborative Emergency Network could significantly enhance the local capacity of Hubei Province for emergency collaboration, which provided insights for building and optimizing COVID-19 collaborative networks in other provinces of China, even other countries.","Liu, Jie; Hao, Jingyu; Shi, Zhenwu; Bao, Helen X H",Nat Hazards (Dordr),,614

Some compounds also show 100% inhibition of CPE (IC100) at 1.25 {micro}M against an authentic SARS-CoV-2 (US_WA-1/2020). Furthermore, the most active inhibitors also potently inhibited variants of concerns (VOCs), such as the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and Delta variant (B.1.617.2), originated in India. We confirmed that one of the potent inhibitors binds to the prefusion spike protein trimer of SARS-CoV-2 by SPR. Besides, we showed that they inhibit virus-mediated cell-cell fusion. The ADME data of one of the most active inhibitors, NBCoV1, show drug-like properties. In vivo PK of NBCoV1 in rats demonstrated excellent half-life (t1/2) of 11.3 h, mean resident time (MRT) of 14.2 h, and oral bioavailability. We expect the lead inhibitors to pave the way for further development to preclinical and clinical candidates.","Curreli, Francesca; Ahmed, Shahad; Victor, Sofia M.

355796,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of selected cardiac electrotherapy and electrophysiology procedures,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. DESIGN: A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes. RESULTS: Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics (90.5%) and remote inpatient consults (26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare (51.2% vs 6.7%), housing (41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services (83.7% vs 53.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action.","White, Erin M; Shaughnessy, Matthew P; Esposito, Andrew C; Slade, Martin D; Korah, Maria; Yoo, Peter S",J. surg. educ,,614

A key problem for implementing quarantine measure is to determine the duration of quarantine. In this paper, a policy with optimal quarantine duration is developed. The policy suggests different quarantine durations for every individual with different characteristic. The policy is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the average quarantine duration of uninfected people with the constraint that the probability of symptom presentation for infected people attains the given value closing to 1. The optimal solution for the quarantine duration is obtained and estimated by some statistic methods with application to analyzing COVID-19 data.","Wang, Ruoyu; Wang, Qihua",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05002v2.pdf,614

To quantitatively evaluate its performance, this paper explores air curtains equipped on normal consulting desk to avoid doctor's direct exposure to the patient exhaled pollutants. A numerical investigation is conducted to evaluate the effects of supply air velocity and angle on cutting off performance. Simulation results show that the average mass fraction of exhaled pollutants decreases significantly (70%-90%) in the consulting ward, indicating satisfying performance of air curtains. Increasing supply air velocity is demonstrated to be conducive in forming full air curtains, whereas an excessively high supply air velocity may be of adverse effects by entraining exhaled flow. Besides, the supply air angle is also critical due to its coupling with supply air velocity. It is found that larger angle (0°-40°) is better where velocity is less than 3 m/s, otherwise a small angle (20°) is preferable where velocity is larger than 3 m/s. Exhaled flow could be well suppressed at the supply air angle 20° but moves over air curtains at 40°. This study can provide effective and intuitive guidance in applying air curtains in consulting wards.

This is the question that has occupied ophthalmologists since the beginning of the outbreak. In order to infect a certain type of tissue specific receptors for each virus and sometimes also coreceptors or other proteins must be present. The aim of this review was to summarize and reflect the current state of research with the help of the currently available literature as of 28 May 2020. At the time of the research, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was clearly identified as the receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as the necessary protease to enable the infection of human cells with SARS-CoV­2. In the eye both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed, although sometimes very weakly and with varying degrees in different tissues. It is noteworthy that very different results were obtained with different methods. Several reasons can account for this effect: Firstly, the method of detection or preservation of the tissue, secondly, the possibly different expression of the tested tissue samples and thirdly, a possibly rapid loss of receptor expression post-mortem. Therefore, an infection of the eye seems possible, which has already been reported in various publications. The amount of virus or receptor expression necessary to cause an infection is not known. According to current state of knowledge the eye is not considered to be a high-risk tissue due to the low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression. Nevertheless, appropriate protective measures are necessary for both medical personnel and patients. In cases of corneal transplantation an infection of the donor tissue with SARS-CoV­2 must be excluded.","Schnichels, Sven; Rohrbach, Jens Martin; Bayyoud, Tarek; Thaler, Sebastian; Ziemssen, Focke; Hurst, José",Ophthalmologe,,614

This study investigated how government formed reactive policies to fight coronavirus across its policy sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents from the PIB. An unsupervised machine-based topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was performed on the text corpus. It was done to extract high probability topics in the policy sectors. The interpretation of the extracted topics was made through a nudge theoretic lens to derive the critical policy heuristics of the government. Results showed that most interventions were targeted to generate endogenous nudge by using external triggers. Notably, the nudges from the Prime Minister of India was critical in creating herd effect on lockdown and social distancing norms across the nation. A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in public spaces; Yoga and Ayurveda for immunity), transport (e.g., old trains converted to isolation wards), micro, small and medium enterprises (e.g., rapid production of PPE and masks), science and technology sector (e.g., diagnostic kits, robots and nano-technology), home affairs (e.g., surveillance and lockdown), urban (e.g. drones, GIS-tools) and education (e.g., online learning).

Since initiation of the pandemic, identification of characteristics that might influence risk of infection and poor disease outcomes have been of paramount interest. Blood group phenotypes are genetically inherited characteristics whose association with certain infectious diseases have long been debated. The aim of this review is to identify whether a certain type of blood group may influence an individual?s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing severe outcomes. Our review shows that blood group O protects individuals against SARS-CoV-2, whereas blood group A predisposes them to being infected. Although the association between blood groups and outcomes of COVID-19 is not consistent, it is speculated that non-O blood group carriers with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing severe outcomes in comparison to O blood group. The interaction between blood groups and SARS-CoV-2 infection is hypothesized to be as result of natural antibodies against blood group antigens that may act as a part of innate immune response to neutralize viral particles. Alternatively, blood group antigens could serve as additional receptors for the virus and individuals who are capable of expressing these antigens on epithelial cells, which are known as secretors, would then have a high propensity to be affected by SARS-CoV-2.","Shokri, Pourya Golmohammadi Saeid Noori Maryam Nejadghaderi Seyed Aria Carson-Chahhoud Kristin Safiri Saeid",Reviews in Medical Virology,,614

Outcomes of open versus MIS segmentectomy for clinical T1, N0, M0 NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base (2010-2015) were evaluated using propensity score matching. Of the 39,351 patients who underwent surgery for stage IA NSCLC from 2010-2015, 770 underwent segmentectomy by thoracotomy and 1,056 by MIS approach (876 thoracoscopic [VATS], 180 robotic). The MIS to open conversion rate was 6.7% (n=71). After propensity-score matching, all baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the open (n=683) and MIS (n=683) groups. When compared to the open group, the MIS group had shorter median length of stay (LOS) (4 vs 5 days, p<0.001) and lower 30-day mortality (0.6% vs 1.9%, p=0.037). There were no significant differences between MIS and open groups with regard to 30-day readmission (5.0% vs 3.7%, p=0.43), or upstaging from cN0 to pN1/N2/N3 (3.1% vs 3.6%, p=0.89). The MIS approach was associated with similar long-term overall survival as the open approach (5-year survival: 62.3% vs 63.5%, p=0.89; multivariable-adjusted HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.82-1.21, p=0.96). In this national analysis of open versus MIS segmentectomy for clinical stage IA NSCLC, MIS was associated with shorter LOS and lower perioperative mortality, and similar nodal upstaging and 5-year survival when compared to segmentectomy via thoracotomy. MIS segmentectomy does not appear to compromise oncologic outcomes for clinical stage IA NSCLC.","Kumar, Arvind; Deng, John; Raman, Vignesh; Okusanya, Olugbenga; Baiu, Ioana; Berry, Mark F; D039,; Amico, Thomas A; Yang, Chi-Fu Jeffrey",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,,614

359871,How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Affected Cardiology Fellow Training,2021,"We evaluated the reliability and validity of the 5-scale grading system to interpret the point-of-care immunoassay for tear matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Six observers graded red bands of photographs of the readout window in MMP-9 immunoassay kit (InflammaDry) two times with 2-week interval based on the 5-scale grading system (i.e. grade 0-4). Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. The interobserver agreements were analyzed according to the severity of tear MMP-9 expression. To validate the system, a concentration calibration curve was made using MMP-9 solutions with reference concentrations, then the distribution of MMP-9 concentrations was analyzed according to the 5-scale grading system. Both intraobserver and interobserver reliability was excellent. The readout grades were significantly correlated with the quantified colorimetric densities. The interobserver variance of readout grades had no correlation with the severity of the measured densities. The band density continued to increase up to a maximal concentration (i.e. 5000 ng/mL) according to the calibration curve. The difference of grades reflected the change of MMP-9 concentrations sensitively, especially between grade 2 and 4. Together, our data indicate that the subjective 5-scale grading system in the point-of-care MMP-9 immunoassay is an easy and reliable method with acceptable accuracy.","Kim, Minjeong; Oh, Ja Young; Bae, Seon Ha; Lee, Seung Hyeun; Lee, Won Jun; Chun, Yeoun Sook; Kim, Kyoung Woo",Sci Rep,,614
359872,How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Affected Cardiology Fellow Training,2021,"INTRODUCTION: This ecological study investigates the association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 occurrence and mortality in 38 European nations as of May 30, 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from Our World in Data. Regression analysis was conducted to adjust for potential confounding factors such as economic activity (gross domestic product), the rate of COVID-19 testing, and the stringency of COVID-19 control policies. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant negative association between smoking prevalence and the prevalence of COVID-19 across the 38 European nations after controlling for confounding factors (p = 0.001). A strong association was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 per million people and economic activity (p = 0.002) and the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0006). Nations with stricter policy enactment showed fewer COVID-19 cases per million people, but the association was not significant (p = 0.122). Delaying policy enactment was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 (p = 0.0535). Evidence of a direct association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality was not found (p = 0.626). There was a strong positive association between COVID-19 mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) as well as the proportion of the population over 65 years of age (p = 0.0034) and a negative association with the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0023). CONCLUSIONS: We found a negative association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 occurrence at the population level in 38 European countries. This association may not imply a true or causal relationship, and smoking is not advocated as a prevention or treatment of COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: Given the evidence of this ecological study, and of several other studies that found an underrepresentation of smoking prevalence in hospitalized cases, it may be worth examining, in laboratory experiments and controlled human trials, if nicotine offers any protection against COVID-19. Most importantly, to date, no study, including this one, supports the view that smoking acts as a treatment intervention or prophylaxis to reduce the impact or ameliorate the negative health impacts of COVID-19.","Tsigaris, Panagiotis; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A",Nicotine Tob Res,,614

360228,Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A View From Trainees on the Front Line,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health threat, both in scope and response. With no vaccine available, the public is advised to practice non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) including social distancing, mask-wearing, and washing hands. However, little is known about public perceptions of the effectiveness of these measures, and high perceived effectiveness is likely to be critical in order to achieve widespread adoption of NPI. METHODS: In May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among U.S. adults (N = 3,474). The primary outcome was a six-item measure assessing perceived effectiveness of recommended behaviors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 (not at all effective) to 5 (extremely effective). The sample was divided into ""higher"" and ""lower"" perceived effectiveness groups. Covariates included demographics, healthcare characteristics, and health beliefs. Variables that were significant at p<0.01 in bivariate analyses were entered into a multivariable logistic regression and a best-fit model was created using a cutoff of p<0.01 to stay in the model. RESULTS: Mean age was 45.5 years and most participants were non-Hispanic White (63%) and female (52.4%). The high perceived effectiveness group was slightly larger than the low perceived effectiveness group (52.7% vs. 47.3%). Almost all health belief variables were significant in the best-fit regression model. COVID-19-related worry (aOR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64-2.02), and perceived threat to physical health (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20-1.45) were positively associated with perceived effectiveness while perceived severity of COVID-19 (0.84; 95% CI = 0.73-0.96) and perceived likelihood of infection (0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) switched directions in the adjusted model and were negatively associated with perceived effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates people generally believe NPI are effective, but there was variability based on health beliefs and there are mixed rates of engagement in these behaviors. Public health efforts should focus on increasing perceived severity and threat of SARS-CoV-2-related disease, while promoting NPI as effective in reducing threat.","Kasting, Monica L; Head, Katharine J; Hartsock, Jane A; Sturm, Lynne; Zimet, Gregory D",PLoS One,,614

This study aims to investigate the willingness of Chinese adults to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and further explore the factors that may affect their willingness. We used a self-design anonymous questionnaire to conduct an online survey via the Sojump. A total of 1009 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 74. Among them, 609 (60.4%, 95%CI: 57.4-63.4%) were willing to receive the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Logistic regression analysis results showed that the age of 30-49 (OR = 2.042, 95%CI: 1.098-3.799), universities and colleges education (OR = 1.873, 95% CI = 1.016-3.451), master degree or above education (OR = 1.885, 95%CI = 1.367-2.599), previous influenza vaccination history (OR = 2.176, 95%CI: 1.474-3.211), trust in the effectiveness of the vaccine (OR = 6.419, 95%CI: 3.717-11.086), and close attention to the latest news of the vaccine (OR = 1.601, 95%CI: 1.046-2.449) were facilitative factors that affected their willingness to be vaccinated. More than half of the adults in China would be willing to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Middle-aged people with higher education, those who had been vaccinated against influenza, and those who believed that COVID-19 vaccine was effective and paid close attention to it were more willing to be vaccinated. Our findings can provide reference for the implementation of vaccination and the prevention of COVID-19 in China. More studies are needed after the vaccine is launched.","Gan, Lin; Chen, Yan; Hu, Peipei; Wu, Dawei; Zhu, Yajuan; Tan, Jinlin; Li, Yufen; Zhang, Dingmei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,614
361139,Development of a telehealth geriatric assessment model in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"AIM: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for substantial changes in the procedures for accessing healthcare services. Even in the current pandemic, we should not reduce our attention towards the diagnosis and treatment of GDM. The purpose of this document is to provide a temporary guide for GDM screening, replacing the current guidelines when it is not possible to implement standard GDM screening because of an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio for pregnant women or when usual laboratory facilities are not available. DATA SYNTHESIS: At the first visit during pregnancy, we must exclude the presence of ""Overt diabetes"" in all women. The criteria for the diagnosis of overt diabetes are either fasting plasma glucose &#8805;126 mg/dL, or random plasma glucose &#8805;200 mg/dL, or glycated hemoglobin &#8805;6.5%. When the screening procedure (OGTT) cannot be safely performed, the diagnosis of GDM is acceptable if fasting plasma glucose is &#8805; 92 mg/dL. In order to consider the impaired fasting glucose as an acceptable surrogate for the diagnosis of GDM, the fasting glucose measurement should be performed within the recommended time windows for the risk level (high or medium risk). CONCLUSIONS: The changes to the screening procedure for GDM reported below are specifically produced in response to the health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, these recommended changes should cease to be in effect and should be replaced by current national guidelines when the healthcare authorities declare the end of this emergency.","Torlone, Elisabetta; Festa, Camilla; Formoso, Gloria; Scavini, Marina; Sculli, Maria A; Succurro, Elena; Sciacca, Laura; Di Bartolo, Paolo; Purrello, Francesco; Lapolla, Annunziata",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,,614

Objective: To assess the health care activities in the ""peak"" of the pandemic during 3 months. Materials and Methods: we collected data from the electronic health record. Results: There were a total of 293 medical appointments from 131 patients (221 face-to-face), that decreased by 16.7% compared to the same period in 2019 (352 appointments). The medical appointments were scheduled to evaluate the continuity of systemic treatment or modifications (95 patients; 72.5%), follow-up (17; 12.9%), first-time consultation (12; 9.1%), and assess paraclinical studies (7; 5.3%). The patients were on hormone therapy (81 patients; 74%), chemotherapy (CT) (21; 19%), and anti-HER2 therapies (9; 8%). New twenty treatments were initiated. Of the 14 patients that were on adjuvant/neoadjuvant CT, 9 (64.3%) continued with the same regimen with the addition of prophylactic granulocyte-colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), and 5 (35.7%), who were receiving weekly paclitaxel, continued the treatment with no changes. Of the seven patients that were on palliative CT, 2 (28.5%) continued the treatment with the addition of G-CSF, 3 (42.8%) continued with weekly capecitabine or paclitaxel with no treatment changes, and 2 (28.5%) changed their treatment regimen (a less myelosuppressive regimen was selected for one and due to progression of the disease in the other patient). The ninety patients who were receiving adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative criteria hormone therapy and/or anti-HER2 therapies, continued the treatment with no changes. Conclusions: The evidence suggests that, although medical appointments decreased by approximately 17%, we could maintain healthcare activities, continued most of the treatments while the most modified was CT with G-CSF to avoid myelosuppression.","Castillo, Cecilia; Camejo, Natalia; Amarillo, Dahiana; Rodriguez, Florencia; Vitureira, Florencia; Krygier, Gabriel; Delgado, Lucía",J Cancer Res Ther,,614

DESIGN: Qualitative study involving key informant interviews. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Purposive sample of US public health practitioners, leaders, and academics expected to be knowledgeable about the report recommendations, public health practice, and changes in public health finance since the report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative feedback about changes to public health finance since the report. RESULTS: Thirty-two interviews were conducted between April and May 2019. The greatest momentum toward the report recommendations has occurred predominantly at the state and local levels, with recommendations requiring federal action making less progress. In addition, much of the progress identified is consensus building and preparation for change rather than clear changes. Overall, progress toward the recommendations has been slow. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the achievements reported by respondents were characterized as increased dialogue and individual state or local progress rather than widespread, identifiable policy or practice changes. Participants suggested that public health as a field needs to achieve further consensus and a uniform voice in order to advocate for changes at a federal level. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE: Slow progress in achieving 2012 IOM Finance Report recommendations and lack of a cohesive voice pose threats to the public's health, as can be seen in the context of COVID-19 emergency response activities. The pandemic and the nation's inadequate response have highlighted deficiencies in our current system and emphasize the need for coordinated and sustained core public health infrastructure funding at the federal level.","Yeager, Valerie A; Balio, Casey P; McCullough, J Mac; Leider, Jonathon P; Orr, Jason; Singh, Simone R; Bekemeier, Betty; Resnick, Beth",,,614
361527,Dental care and the COVID-19 pandemic: The precautionary principle and the best available evidence,2020,"The effective reproduction number, Rt, is a key time-varying prognostic for the growth rate of any infectious disease epidemic. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about new transmissions within a population or predict the efficacy of interventions. Inferring Rt reliably and in real-time from observed time-series of infected (demographic) data is an important problem in population dynamics. The renewal or branching process model is a popular solution that has been applied to Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks, among others, and is currently being used to investigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This model estimates Rt using a heuristically chosen piecewise function. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant Rt changes, inference is highly sensitive to the function choice. Improperly chosen piecewise models might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones, yet produce visually reasonable estimates. No principled piecewise selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory, which deems the model capable of describing the observed data using the fewest bits as most justified. We derive exact posterior prediction distributions for infected population size and integrate these within an APE framework to obtain an exact and reliable method for identifying the piecewise function best supported by available epidemic data. We find that this choice optimises short-term prediction accuracy and can rapidly detect salient fluctuations in Rt, and hence the infected population growth rate, in real-time over the course of an unfolding epidemic. Moreover, we emphasise the need for formal selection by exposing how common heuristic choices, which seem sensible, can be misleading. Our APE-based method is easily computed and broadly applicable to statistically similar models found in phylogenetics and macroevolution, for example. Our results explore the relationships among estimate precision, forecast reliability and model complexity.","Parag, Kris V; Donnelly, Christl A",PLoS Comput Biol,,614

362309,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Associated Worsening of Diabetic Ketoacidosis Presentation in Youth,2021,"Immune dysregulation is a hallmark of patients infected by SARS-CoV2 and the balance between immune reactivity and tolerance is a key determinant of all stages of infection, including the excessive inflammatory state causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome. The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and drives mechanisms of immune tolerance. We examined the state of activation of the KP by measuring the Kyn:Trp ratio in the serum of healthy subjects (n = 239), and SARS-CoV2-negative (n = 305) and -positive patients (n = 89). Patients were recruited at the Emergency Room of St. Andrea Hospital (Rome, Italy). Kyn and Trp serum levels were assessed by HPLC/MS-MS. Compared to healthy controls, both SARS-CoV2-negative and -positive patients showed an increase in the Kyn:Trp ratio. The increase was larger in SARS-CoV2-positive patients, with a significant difference between SARS-CoV2-positive and -negative patients. In addition, the increase was more prominent in males, and positively correlated with age and severity of SARS-CoV2 infection, categorized as follows: 1 = no need for intensive care unit (ICU); 2 &#8804; 3 weeks spent in ICU; 3 &#8805; 3 weeks spent in ICU; and 4 = death. The highest Kyn:Trp values were found in SARS-CoV2-positive patients with severe lymphopenia. These findings suggest that the Kyn:Trp ratio reflects the level of inflammation associated with SARS-CoV2 infection, and, therefore, might represent a valuable biomarker for therapeutic intervention.","Lionetto, Luana; Ulivieri, Martina; Capi, Matilde; De Bernardini, Donatella; Fazio, Francesco; Petrucca, Andrea; Pomes, Leda Marina; De Luca, Ottavia; Gentile, Giovanna; Casolla, Barbara; Curto, Martina; Salerno, Gerardo; Schillizzi, Serena; Torre, Maria Simona; Santino, Iolanda; Rocco, Monica; Marchetti, Paolo; Aceti, Antonio; Ricci, Alberto; Bonfini, Rita; Nicoletti, Ferdinando; Simmaco, Maurizio; Borro, Marina",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,,614

However, little is known about their clinical performance. Here, we compared two commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays. METHODS: 103 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 153 control specimens were analyzed using SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays by Abbott and EUROIMMUN (EI). Duration from symptom onset was determined by medical record review. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and concordance were calculated. RESULTS: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had a diagnostic specificity of 99.4% (95% CI; 96.41-99.98%), and sensitivity of 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3 days post symptom onset, 30.0% (95% CI; 11.89-54.28) at 3-7d, 47.8% (95% CI; 26.82-69.41) at 8-13d and 93.8% (95% CI; 82.80-98.69) at &#8805;14d. Diagnostic specificity on the EI assay was 94.8% (95% CI; 89.96-97.72) if borderline results were considered positive and 96.7% (95% CI; 92.54-98.93) if borderline results were considered negative. The diagnostic sensitivity was 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3d, 25.0% (95% CI; 8.66-49.10) at 3-7d, 56.5% (95% CI; 34.49-76.81) at 3-7d and 85.4% (95% CI; 72.24-93.93) at &#8805;14d if borderline results were considered positive. The qualitative concordance between the assays was 0.83 (95% CI; 0.75-0.91). CONCLUSION: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had fewer false positive and false negative results than the EI assay. However, diagnostic sensitivity was poor in both assays during the first 14 days of symptoms.","Tang, Mei San; Hock, Karl G; Logsdon, Nicole M; Hayes, Jennifer E; Gronowski, Ann M; Anderson, Neil W; Farnsworth, Christopher W",Clin Chem,,614

Health officials assume that the public will have high rates of compliance. However, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern about loss of income. A cross-sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed, depending on whether lost wages would be compensated for. When compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94 percent.

363758,How the COVID-19 pandemic has prevented children with cancer from pursuing their schooling in hospital or at home,2021,"Since its emergence in China, the COVID-19 pandemic has become the number 1 health challenge in the world with all affected countries trying to learn from each other's experiences. When it comes to health services, dental care does not seem to be a priority area, despite the fact that it is among the highest risk medical specialisations in terms of spreading the infection. Using the Department of Community Dentistry of Semmelweis University as a case study, the objective of this paper is to introduce and analyze the system and organizational level measures, which have been implemented in dental care in Hungary during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak. The system level measures to promote social distancing, to reduce the use of health services and to protect high risk health professionals, together with the deployment of protective equipment and the reorganization of patient pathways at the organizational level proved to be effective in keeping the outbreak in control. There are two, less frequently mentioned ingredients of successful coping with the COVID-19 challenge. First, mental health support is at least as important as physical protection. Second, most of the interventions do not require big financial investments, but behavioural change, which in turn requires leadership and change management skills.","Nemeth, Orsolya; Orsos, Mercedesz; Simon, Fanni; Gaal, Peter",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,614

365132,Timeline and Procedures on Restarting Non-Emergent Arthroplasty Care in the US Epicenter of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Because of the mandatory sanitary measures established during the Covid-19 Pandemic, we have proposed to describe the new clinical, educative, and research practices of an international sample of doctors. METHODS: We have used an online electronic survey of a convenient sample of doctors from 40 countries using a multiple-choice online questionnaire, including three domains. 424 out of 456 respondents provided adequate responses. RESULTS: Most respondents were from medical (51.5%) and surgical (11.8%) specialties. Over half of the respondents practiced in academic centers and one fifth in the private sector. Coronavirus pandemic induced frequent changes in practice, such as seeing fewer patients in clinics than usual (34.9%) and utilization of telemedicine (31.3%). A significant disruption in medical education activities and residents' training was observed, resulting in the cancellation of many activities such as grand rounds, departmental and multidisciplinary meetings, and case conferences with over-reliance on virtual and on-demand educational sessions. The residents' supervision and support were significantly reduced. Almost 16% of respondents were involved in research work on coronavirus pandemic while a third continued their usual research activity, but half were not involved in any research at the time of the survey. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic has promoted new practices in the field as the recourse to telemedicine, virtual conferences, and thematic researches on COVID-19. The unexpected situation has opened new prospects for future doctors' preparation for these new means of practice and learning of medicine.","Beshyah, Salem A; Ibrahim, Wanis H; Hajjaji, Issam M; Ben Mami, Faika; Arekat, Mona; Abdelmannan, Dima K",Tunis Med,,614

365499,"COVID-19, conflict, and non-communicable diseases among refugees",2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading across the world to cause thousands of mortalities each day. Poor responses from the authorities to the spread of infection, lack of effective measures for prevention, unavailability of promising treatment options, and sufficient diagnostic options have created an alarming for the world. The transmission routes from human to human of SARS-CoV-2 can be the direct transmission, droplet inhalation transmission, contact transmission, transmission through saliva, and transmission via fecal–oral routes. Due to the asymptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2's, developing control and prevention measures is challenging. Implementing proper strategies addressing the infection control and clinical supplies, understanding the mechanism associated with pathogenesis, advancing in preventive measures and effective treatment and diagnostic options are necessary to control the ongoing pandemic.

365773,A National Survey Evaluating the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Students Pursuing Careers in Neurosurgery,2020,"We report the crystal structures of GaAs and GaAs/GaNAs/GaAs core-multishell nanowires (NWs). From statistical investigations by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) pattern analysis, we statistically and microscopically resolve the zinc-blende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) polytypism within the NWs. The XRD analysis shows a smaller fraction of WZ segments in the NWs with a larger concentration of nitrogen. With increasing nitrogen content in the GaNAs shell, the ZB peak position shifts toward higher angles and the WZ peak intensity decreases. The EBSD measurements also confirm the coexistence of ZB and WZ polytypes in all of the NWs. Their polytype switches along the length. Twin defects are observed in the ZB segments in all of the NWs. The unique grain map and grain size distribution show a decrease of the WZ segments in the GaAs/GaNAs/GaAs NW, in agreement with the XRD results. Microscopically, the local area where the polytype switches from WZ in the inner-core side to ZB toward the outer-shell surface is observed. Overall, we propose that the WZ polytype in the GaAs NWs decreases because of the strain induced by the growth of the GaNAs shell with a smaller lattice constant.","Yukimune, Mitsuki; Fujiwara, Ryo; Mita, Takaya; Ishikawa, Fumitaro",,,614
365837,Organization of a reference haemophilia unit and its change of activity during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. The virus infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), represents a global concern, as almost all countries around the world are affected. Clinical reports have confirmed several neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients such as headaches, vomiting, and nausea, indicating the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Neuroinvasion of coronaviruses is not a new phenomenon, as it has been demonstrated by previous autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) patients who experienced similar neurologic symptoms. The hypothalamus is a complex structure that is composed of many nuclei and diverse neuronal cell groups. It is characterized by intricate intrahypothalamic circuits that orchestrate a finely tuned communication within the CNS and with the PNS. Hypothalamic circuits are critical for maintaining homeostatic challenges including immune responses to viral infections. The present article reviews the possible routes and mechanisms of neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2, with a specific focus on the role of the hypothalamic circuits in mediating the neurological symptoms noted during COVID-19 infection.","Mussa, Bashair M; Srivastava, Ankita; Verberne, Anthony J M",Viruses,,614

However, it remains largely unknown about whether dMyc can be involved in Drosophila innate immune response. Here, we have identified dMyc to be a negative regulator of Drosophila Imd pathway via the loss- and gain-of-function screening. We demonstrate that dMyc inhibits Drosophila Imd immune response via directly activating miR-277 transcription, which further inhibit the expression of imd and Tab2-Ra/b. Importantly, dMyc can improve the survival of flies upon infection, suggesting inhibiting Drosophila Imd pathway by dMyc is vital to restore immune homeostasis that is essential for survival. Taken together, our study not only reports a new dMyc-miR-277-imd/Tab2 axis involved in the negative regulation of Drosophila Imd pathway, and provides a new insight into the complex regulatory mechanism of Drosophila innate immune homeostasis maintenance.","Li, Ruimin; Zhou, Hongjian; Jia, Chaolong; Jin, Ping; Ma, Fei",PLoS Genet,,614

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unimodally distributed over a broad range, with symptom severity correlating directly with virus-specific antibody magnitude. Seventy-six subjects followed longitudinally to â¼100 days demonstrated marked heterogeneity in antibody duration dynamics. Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in most individuals, whereas a distinct subset had stable or increasing antibody levels in the same time frame despite similar initial antibody magnitudes. These individuals with increasing responses recovered rapidly from symptomatic COVID-19 disease, harbored increased somatic mutations in virus-specific memory B cell antibody genes, and had persistent higher frequencies of previously activated CD4+ T cells.

Without effective drugs to cure COVID-19, early identification and control of risk factors are important measures to combat COVID-19. This study was conducted to determine the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital in South India. This record-based longitudinal study was conducted by reviewing the case records of COVID-19 patients admitted for treatment from June 2020 to September 2020 in a tertiary care centre in South India. The clinical details, discharge/death details, were collected and entered in MS Excel. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were analysed using univariate binomial logistic regression, generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson distribution. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to test the equality of survivor functions between the groups. Out of 854 COVID-19 patients, 56.6% were men and the mean (standard deviation) age was 45.3(17.2) years. The median survival time was significantly lesser in male COVID-19 patients (16 days) as compared to female patients (20 days). Increasing age, male gender, patients presenting with symptoms of fever, cough, breathlessness, smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients. Patients with older age, male gender, breathlessness, fever, cough, smoking and alcohol and comorbidities need careful observation and early intervention. Public health campaigns aimed at reducing the prevalence of risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, smoking and alcohol use are also needed.","Marimuthu, Yamini; Kunnavil, Radhika; Anil, N S; Nagaraja, Sharath Burugina; Satyanarayana, N; Kumar, Jeetendra; Ramya, Bojja",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,614

The aim of the current study was to investigate psychosocial and behavioural factors that may explain the rise and fall of distress during the initial months of the COVID-19 crisis. DESIGN: This study examined six waves of longitudinal nationally representative data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March and June 2020 (N = 7,138, observations = 34,125). METHODS: Mediation analysis was used to identify whether changes in distress (PHQ-4) during the COVID-19 pandemic were explained by the following factors: perceived infection risk and risk of death, perceived financial risks, lifestyle changes resulting from the virus, perceived discrimination related to the virus, and changes in substance use and employment status. RESULTS: All mediating factors played a role in explaining changes in distress and together accounted for 70% of the increase in distress between 10-18 March and 1-14 April and 46.4% of the decline in distress between 1-14 April and early June 2020. Changes in perceived health risks were most important in explaining changes in distress followed by changes in lifestyle and the perceived financial risks associated with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides longitudinal population-based evidence detailing the mediating factors explaining changes in distress during the COVID-19 crisis. Perceived health risks associated with the virus may play a key role in explaining rising and falling levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Robinson, Eric; Daly, Michael",Br. j. health psychol,,614

As a large, quaternary care medical center, NYU Langone Medical Center was one of many New York medical centers that experienced an unprecedented influx of patients during this time. Clinical leadership effectively identified, oriented, and rapidly deployed a ""COVID Army,"" consisting of non-hospitalist physicians, to meet the needs of the patient influx. We share feedback from our providers on our processes and offer specific recommendations for systems experiencing a similar influx in the current and future pandemics. METHODS: To assess the experiences and perceived readiness of these physicians (n = 183), we distributed a 32-item survey between March and June of 2020. Thematic analyses and response rates were examined to develop results. RESULTS: Responses highlighted varying experiences and attitudes of our frontline physicians during an emerging pandemic. Thematic analyses revealed a series of lessons learned, including the need to (1) provide orientations, (2) clarify roles/workflow, (3) balance team workload, (4) keep teams updated on evolving policies, (5) make team members feel valued, and (6) ensure they have necessary tools available.

We employed a novel body-conforming soft wearable sensor placed on the suprasternal notch to capture data on physical activity, cardio-respiratory function, and cough sounds. RESULTS: We performed a pilot study in a cohort of individuals (n=14) who tested positive for COVID-19 and detected altered heart rate, respiration rate and heart rate variability, relative to a group of healthy individuals (n=14) with no known exposure. Logistic regression classifiers were trained on individual and combined sets of physiological features (heartbeat and respiration dynamics, walking cadence, and cough frequency spectrum) at discriminating COVID-positive participants from the healthy group. Combining features yielded an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI=[0.92, 0.96]) using a leave-one-subject-out cross validation scheme. Conclusions and Clinical Impact: These results, although preliminary, suggest that a sensor-based snapshot paradigm may be a promising approach for non-invasive and repeatable testing to alert individuals that need further screening.","Lonini, Luca; Shawen, Nicholas; Botonis, Olivia; Fanton, Michael; Jayaraman, Chadrasekaran; Mummidisetty, Chaithanya Krishna; Shin, Sung Yul; Rushin, Claire; Jenz, Sophia; Xu, Shuai; Rogers, John A; Jayaraman, Arun",IEEE J Transl Eng Health Med,,614

370632,The spread of COVID-19 in six western metropolitan regions: a false myth on the excess of mortality in Lombardy and the defense of the city of Milan,2020,"We propose a data driven epidemic model using the real data on the infection, recovery and death cases for the analysis of COVID-19 progression in India. The model assumes continuation of existing control measures such as lockdown and quarantines, the suspected and confirmed cases and does not consider the scenario of 2nd surge of the epidemic due to any reason. The model is arrived after least square fitting of epidemic behaviour model based on theoretical formulation to the real data of cumulative infection cases reported between 24 March 2020 and 30May 2020. The predictive capability of the model has been validated with real data of infection cases reported during June 1–10, 2020. A detailed analysis of model predictions in terms of future trend of COVID-19 progress individually in 18 states of India and India as a whole has been attempted. Infection rate in India, as a whole, is continuously decreasing with time and has reached 3 times lower than the initial infection rate after 6 weeks of lock down suggesting the effectiveness of the lockdown in containing the epidemic. Results suggest that India, as a whole, could see the peak and end of the epidemic in the month of July 2020 and March 2021 respectively as per the current trend in the data. Active infected cases in India may touch 2 lakhs or little above at the peak time and total infected cases may reach over 19 lakhs as per current trend. State-wise results have been discussed in the manuscript. However, the prediction may deviate particularly for longer dates, as assumptions of model cannot be met always in a real scenario. In view of this, a real time application (COV-IND Predictor) has been developed which automatically syncs the latest data from the national COVID19 dash board on daily basis and updates the model input parameters and predictions instantaneously. This real time application can be accessed from the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fCwgnQ-dz4J0YWVDHUcbEW1423wOJjdEXm8TqJDWNAk/edit?usp=sharing and can serve as a practical tool for policy makers to track peak time and maximum active infected cases based on latest trend in data for medical readiness and taking epidemic management decisions.","Sahoo, Bijay Kumar; Sapra, Balvinder Kaur",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,614

Due to the strong mobility restrictions imposed on citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, we allow the home office to be located at home. At the home office, however, in consequence of the fear and anxiety workers feel because of COVID-19, they become distracted and spend less time working.

When the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic hit the United States (US) in March 2020, a tremendous strain was placed on first responders and healthcare workers, resulting in a program expansion to include stress mitigation strategies. From 31 March 2020, through 31 December 2020, 1530 unique first responders and frontline clinicians participated in the newly expanded First Responder Resiliency (FRR) ECHO. The robust curriculum included: psychological first aid, critical incident debriefing, moral distress, crisis management strategies, and self-care skills. Survey and focus group results demonstrated that, while overall stress levels did not decline, participants felt more confident using psychological first aid, managing and recognizing colleagues who needed mental health assistance, and taking time for self-care. Although first responders still face a higher level of stress as a result of their occupation, this FRR ECHO program improves stress management skills while providing weekly learning-listening sessions, social support, and a community of practice for all first responders.","Katzman, Joanna G; Tomedi, Laura E; Everly, George; Greenwood-Ericksen, Margaret; Romero, Elizabeth; Rosenbaum, Nils; Medrano, Jessica; Menking, Paige; Archer, Gaelyn R D; Martin, Chamron; Dow, Karina A; McCoy-Hayes, Shannon; Katzman, Jeffrey W",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,614

373195,Acral purpuric lesions associated with coagulation disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: We are laryngologists. We observe natural phonatory and swallowing functions in clinical examinations with a trans-nasal laryngeal fiberscope (TNLF). Before each observation, we use epinephrine to enlarge and smooth the common nasal meatus (bottom of nostril) and then insert a wet swab inside the nose, as in taking a swab culture in the nasopharynx. During the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, this careful technique prevents any complications, including nasal bleeding, painfulness, and induced sneezing. Here, we introduce our routine to observe esophageal movement in swallowing in a natural (sitting) position without anesthesia. CASE PRESENTATION: The case was a 70-year-old female who complained that something was stuck in her esophagus; there was a strange sensation below the larynx and pharynx. After enlarging and smoothing the common nasal meatus, we inserted the TNLF (slim type â2.9 mm fiberscope, VNL8-J10, PENTAX Medical, Tokyo, Japan.) in the normal way. We then observed the phonatory and swallowing movements of the vocal folds. As usual, to not interfere with natural movements, we used no anesthesia. We found no pathological condition in the pyriform sinus. We asked the patient to swallow the fiberscope. During the swallow, we pushed the TNLF and inserted the tip a bit deeper, which made the fiberscope easily enter the esophagus, like in the insertion of a nasogastric tube. We then asked the patient to swallow a sip of water or saliva to clear and enlarge the lumen of the esophagus. This made it possible to observe the esophagus easily without any air supply. With tone enhancement scan, the esophagus was found to be completely normal except for glycogenic acanthosis. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of this examination is that it is easily able to perform without anesthesia and with the patient in sitting position. It is quick and minimally invasive, enabling observation the physiologically natural swallowing. It is also possible to observe without anesthesia down to the level of the esophagogastric junction using with a thin type flexible bronchoscope. In the future, gastric fiberscopes might be thinner, even with narrow band imaging (NBI) function. Before that time, physicians should remember to just insert along the bottom of the nose.","Tsunoda, Koichi; Hentona, Ko; Yamanobe, Yoshiharu",Eur J Med Res,,614

375683,Impact of Covid-19 Pandemic in Ibd Patient Care,2021,"Under the current complex economic situation and the impact of COVID-19, China’s capital market reform has entered a critical period, with opportunities and challenges coexisting. One of the important challenges is how to improve the well-being of investors in capital markets. Financial education, which has been offered by financial institutions in many countries in recent years, is likely to become an effective policy instrument to meet this challenge. Using survey data of individual investors from China, this study examines the potential impact of financial education programs offered by financial institutions on individuals’ investment diversification. The results show financial education is positively associated with the investment diversification of individual investors. An analysis of the underlying mechanism shows that financial education contributes to the improvement of investment diversification by mitigating limited attention bias, strengthening social trust, and promoting the use of professional investment advisors. These findings suggest that the persistent promotion of financial education programs has a positive effect on optimizing financial asset allocation decisions and improving financial welfare of Chinese households. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Zhang, Y.; Lu, X.; Xiao, J.

376419,"""Not Wars, Water pumps"" - From emotive to rational language in managing the Covid-19 pandemic",2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, men who have sex with men (MSM) in the USA have reported similar or fewer sexual partners and reduced HIV testing and care access compared with before the pandemic. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use has also declined. We aimed to quantify the potential effect of COVID-19 on HIV incidence and HIV-related mortality among US MSM. METHODS: We used a calibrated, deterministic, compartmental HIV transmission model for MSM in Baltimore (MD, USA) and available data on COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV services to predict effects of reductions in sexual partners (0%, 25%, 50%), condom use (5%), HIV testing (20%), viral suppression (10%), PrEP initiations (72%), PrEP adherence (9%), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiations (50%). In our main analysis, we modelled disruptions due to COVID-19 starting Jan 1, 2020, and lasting 6 months. We estimated the median change in cumulative new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths among MSM over 1 and 5 years, compared with a base case scenario without COVID-19-related disruptions. FINDINGS: A 25% reduction in sexual partners for 6 months among MSM in Baltimore, without HIV service changes, could reduce new HIV infections by median 12·2% (95% credible interval 11·7 to 12·8) over 1 year and median 3·0% (2·6 to 3·4) over 5 years. In the absence of changes in sexual behaviour, the 6-month estimated reductions in condom use, HIV testing, viral suppression, PrEP initiations, PrEP adherence, and ART initiations combined are predicted to increase new HIV infections by median 10·5% (5·8 to 16·5) over 1 year, and by median 3·5% (2·1 to 5·4) over 5 years. Disruptions to ART initiations and viral suppression are estimated to substantially increase HIV-related deaths (ART initiations by median 1·7% [0·8 to 3·2], viral suppression by median 9·5% [5·2 to 15·9]) over 1 year, with smaller proportional increases over 5 years. The other individual disruptions (to HIV testing, PrEP and condom use, PrEP initiation, and partner numbers) were estimated to have little effect on HIV-related deaths (<1% change over 1 or 5 years). A 25% reduction in sexual partnerships is estimated to offset the effect of the combined service disruptions on new HIV infections (change over 1 year: median -3·9% [-7·4 to 1·0]; over 5 years: median 0·0% [-0·9 to 1·4]), but not on HIV deaths (change over 1 year: 11·0% [6·2 to 17·7]; over 5 years: 2·6% [1·5 to 4·3]). INTERPRETATION: Maintaining access to ART and adherence support is of the utmost importance to maintain viral suppression and minimise excess HIV-related mortality due to COVID-19 restrictions in the USA, even if disruptions to services are accompanied by reductions in sexual partnerships.

376795,Alert for COVID-19 second wave: A lesson from Vietnam,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In the face of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, people with dementia and their carers are contending with serious challenges to their health and wellbeing, due to risk of severe illness, limiting of social contact and disruption to usual activities. Many forms of support for people with dementia and their carers, including singing groups, have moved online using videoconferencing. Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of group singing, which include cognitive stimulation, meaningful activity and peer support. However, although we know which aspects of the singing group experience participants find helpful, we do not know how this experience translates into an online videoconferencing format, and this is a very new field with little existing research. This article reviews the literature pertinent to online singing interventions and uses the findings to develop some suggestions for running an online singing group. STUDY DESIGN: SCOPING REVIEW. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were conducted in EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Owing to the paucity of existing research, searches were also conducted in Google Scholar. The scope of the review covered five related areas: online music making and music therapy, telemedicine and telecare, everyday technology for people with dementia, digital arts and dementia, and use of technology for social interaction and leisure. Our analysis aimed to integrate the results to inform the implementation of online singing groups for people with dementia. RESULTS: Scoping of evidence from discrete fields of enquiry and different disciplinary traditions can inform the delivery of online singing in dementia. This literature also yields useful insights into the role of the carer and how best to support participants to use technology. Barriers and facilitators to online singing were found to relate both to the technology and to the individual participant. CONCLUSION: Lockdown restrictions have led to much innovation, and this is likely to lead to changes in practice even after normal life resumes. The suggestions in this article will be helpful primarily for practitioners moving into online work and researchers investigating this novel area. They may also be useful to commissioners and policymakers because they reflect current knowledge about best practice.","Dowson, B; Schneider, J",Public Health,,614

At the same time, organizations working on Systems of Systems have been developing solutions for closing this gap for many years now. This work aims to extract such knowledge from practitioners by studying the case of a large-scale scientific instrument, a geographically distributed radio telescope to be more specific, developed as a sequence of projects during the last two decades. As the means for collecting data for this study we combine online interviews with a virtual focus group of practitioners from the organization responsible for building the instrument. Through this process, we identify persisting problems and the best practices that have been developed to deal with them, together with the perceived benefits and drawbacks of applying the latter in practice.

378369,Functional Brain Networks of Trait and State Anxiety in Late-Life Depression,2021,"Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of social distancing, self-isolation and limited access to public spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life and psychological well-being of young people. Subject and methods: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus posed a new global challenge in 2020. The new coronavirus emerged locally, but it rapidly spread to all continents and also reached Poland. On 24 March, the Polish Ministry of Health enforced self-isolation measures to contain the transmission of the disease. The new regulations imposed restrictions on civic freedoms, including access to public spaces. These measures significantly affected the daily lives of Polish citizens. Public spaces play a fundamental role in catering to the citizens' basic needs. Access to public spaces is directly correlated with the quality of life, human relations and spontaneous interactions. Young people are highly socially active, and they are frequent users of public spaces. University students (young adults) who transitioned to online learning on 12 March were surveyed remotely with the Microsoft Forms online tool. The questionnaire contained several questions to elicit demographic information about the respondents, as well as 25 closed-ended questions relating to university students' quality of life and access to public spaces during the epidemic. The survey was carried out during the first Polish lockdown in April 2020. The study group was composed of 132 respondents who were university students aged 19-26. Results: The results revealed a strong correlation between the severity of lockdown measures during the epidemic and the students' activity levels in public spaces, a considerable deterioration in their physical and psychological well-being, and the overall quality of life. Conclusion: The respondents were significantly affected by the absence of direct social interactions which, in their opinion, can be only partially compensated for by remote contact.","Szczepanska, Agnieszka; Pietrzyka, Katarzyna",Z Gesundh Wiss,,614
378372,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Measles surveillance in Pakistan,2020,"CONTEXT: There is rapidly increasing need for palliative care in Greater China due to rapidly aging populations. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically review and appraise evidence for palliative care needs, models of care, interventions, and outcomes in Greater China. METHODS: Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were searched, with hand searching of local journals and databases. Narrative synthesis was applied to the qualitative and quantitative evidence. RESULTS: Nineteen qualitative studies and 47 quantitative studies were retained. With respect to care needs, nine themes were synthesised: pain control, reduced aggressive end-of-life care, truth telling, physical, emotional and spiritual support, and achieving preferred place of care/death. Informal caregivers expressed their needs for education and burden reduction. Healthcare professionals called for training and national policy support. Twenty-four studies evaluated interventions, mostly among advanced cancer patients. Positive effects were suggested for improvements in quality of life, pain, anxiety and depression, readmission rate, and costs. Models of care evaluated were mostly specialist palliative care delivered in various settings (hospitals, residential care and home). Outcome measures used were grouped into six categories of construct: quality of life, pain, physical assessment, psycho-spiritual assessment, quality of care, and implementation assessment. Limited rigorous randomised controlled trials is available to document intervention outcomes, and some problems (such as high attrition rates) reduced the strength of the evidence. CONCLUSION: Palliative care services within Greater China should pay more attention to management of non-malignant disease, and to integration into primary services. Policy support is key to establishing culturally appropriate person-centred services.","Chung, Huei; Harding, Richard; Guo, Ping",J. pain symptom manage,,614

This study examines its early effect on a busy academic emergency department. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients from an academic tertiary care Level I trauma, cardiac and stroke center's emergency department seeing an average of 54,000 adults and 21,000 pediatric patients per year. Total visits, reasons for patient visits, demographics, disposition, and length of stay were analyzed from January through July 2020 and compared with the same time period in the previous 2 y. RESULTS: From March through July 2020 there were statistically significant decreases in the total number of patient visits (-47%) especially among pediatric (-73%) and elderly (-43%) patients and those with cardiovascular (-39%), neurological (-63%) complaints, headaches (-60%), back pain (-64%), abdominal pain (-51%), and minor trauma (-71%). There was, however, a significant increase in pulmonary complaints (+54%), as well as admissions (+32%), and length of stay (+40%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant drop in overall patients and select groups early in the pandemic, while admissions and emergency department length of stay both increased. This has implications for future pandemic planning.","Flamm, Avram; Lee, Alexander; Mencl, Francis",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,614

379144,Doctors' wellbeing: self-care during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was originally recognized in December 2019 as a case of lung infection in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 has affected the capability of health care experts to treat patients face to face. One initiative to improve the efficacy and convenience of patient care despite the physical distancing limitations has been the application of ""virtual clinics"" (VCs) as a treatment modality. This study was aimed to investigate the use of VCs as a tool of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This study was conducted in the ambulatory care setting at King Abdullah Specialized Children Hospital in Riyadh. Respondents were selected from different groups of health care providers. The study was a hospital-based cross-sectional design using an electronic survey. Results: In total, 277 surveys were collected. Principal findings showed the deployment of VCs by 67.2% (n = 186) of providers. Among these providers, 54.3% were female, and only 18.8% of providers were aged >54 years. 98.1% of the respondents have started running VCs since the COVID-19 outbreak, with 47.2% of respondents running between 51 and 100 VCs per month, and the majority (74%) were spending 6-15 min per patient visit. Chronically ill patients constituted 57.7% of the patient's population served. Almost 95% of respondents used electronic prescriptions during their VCs. Most providers (98.1%) used the telephone/mobile as a means of communication with the patient during these VCs. A total of 75.5% of VCs were integrated with electronic health records such as appointment scheduling (77.9%), and 88.3% of the providers were satisfied with their VCs. The major opportunity seen by providers was reducing appointment waiting times (73.4%). The major success metric seen in VCs was increased patient satisfaction as reported by providers (67.9%). In contrast, the major challenge seen was the lack of face-to-face interaction and physical examination (86.8%). Conclusion: VCs are one way of centering the health system around the patient, but careful attention is needed to integrate these services with the current health care delivery system in place and ensure quality care to the patients.","Eddine, Inaam Shehabe; Zedan, Haya S",Telemed. j. e. health,,614

RESULTS: My findings indicate that there is under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths in the USA, although the evidence for and the extent of under-reporting does depend on the statistic one uses to assess conformity with Benford's law. CONCLUSIONS: Benford's law is a useful diagnostic tool for verifying data and can be used before a more detailed audit or resource intensive investigation.","Campolieti, Michele",J. public health (Oxf),,614

A Narrative Review,2020,"As of January 3, 2021, a total of 20,346,372 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 349,246 associated deaths have been reported in the United States. Long-term sequalae of COVID-19 over the course of a lifetime currently are unknown; however, persistent symptoms and serious complications are being reported among COVID-19 survivors, including persons who initially experience a mild acute illness.* On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to prevent COVID-19, administered as 2 doses separated by 21 days. On December 12, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (1); initial doses were recommended for health care personnel and long-term care facility residents (2). As of December 23, 2020, a reported 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the United States, and reports of 4,393 (0.2%) adverse events after receipt of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Among these, 175 case reports were identified for further review as possible cases of severe allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that does occur rarely after vaccination, with onset typically within minutes to hours (3). Twenty-one cases were determined to be anaphylaxis (a rate of 11.1 per million doses administered), including 17 in persons with a documented history of allergies or allergic reactions, seven of whom had a history of anaphylaxis. The median interval from vaccine receipt to symptom onset was 13 minutes (range = 2-150 minutes). Among 20 persons with follow-up information available, all had recovered or been discharged home. Of the remaining case reports that were determined not to be anaphylaxis, 86 were judged to be nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, and 61 were considered nonallergic adverse events. Seven case reports were still under investigation. This report summarizes the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of case reports of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, after receipt of the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine during December 14-23, 2020, in the United States. CDC has issued updated interim clinical considerations for use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States (4) and interim considerations for preparing for the potential management of anaphylaxis (5). In addition to screening for contraindications and precautions before administering COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine locations should have the necessary supplies available to manage anaphylaxis, should implement postvaccination observation periods, and should immediately treat persons experiencing anaphylaxis signs and symptoms with intramuscular injection of epinephrine (4,5).",,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,614
380749,Universal health coverage for strengthening prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases in COVID-19 era,2020,"The Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility and Inflexibility on the Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown in Italy. Preliminary data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on mental health in approximately a quarter of the general population. Few prior studies have identified contextual risk factors and no published study has explored factors that might moderate their adverse effects on mental health. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. This study investigated the roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility in moderating the effects of COVID-19 risk factors on three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, depression. We hypothesized that psychological flexibility would mitigate and psychological inflexibility would exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. During the Italian national lockdown (M = 39.29 days, SD = 11.26), 1035 adults (79% female, M = 37.5 years, SD = 12.3) completed an online survey. Twelve COVID-19 risk factors were identified (e.g. lockdown duration, family infected by COVID-19, increase in domestic violence and in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours) and constituted a COVID-19 Lockdown Index. As predicted, results showed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, global psychological flexibility and four of its sub-processes (self-as context, defusion, values, committed action), mitigated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. In contrast and as expected, global psychological inflexibility and four of its sub-processes (lack of contact with present moment, fusion, self-as-content, lack of contact with personal values) exacerbated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. Findings converge with those from the broader psychological flexibility literature providing robust support for the use of ACT-based interventions to promote psychological flexibility and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pakenham, Kenneth I.; Landi, Giulia; Boccolini, Giada; Furlani, Annalisa; Grandi, Silvana; Tossani, Eliana",J.

The pathogen was identified quickly and was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infectious disease caused by this virus is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within months, it has caused a global pandemic and posed a major threat to public health worldwide. As of May 23, 2020, 5 252 452 patients have been confirmed to have the disease, and 339 026 deaths have been reported. Multiple therapeutic trials are ongoing, and some promising results have been released. A vaccine would provide the most effective approach to fight the virus by preventing infection, but none are currently available. To control the COVID-19 outbreak, large-scale measures have been applied to reduce human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Susceptible populations, including older adults, children, and healthcare providers, warrant particular attention to avoid transmission and infection. This review introduces current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment strategies, emphasizing the relevant challenges associated with prevention, diagnosis, and management.","Luo, Yung-Hung; Chiu, Hwa-Yen; Weng, Chia-Sui; Chen, Yuh-Min",J Chin Med Assoc,,614

OBJECTIVE: We attempt to better understand the relationship of QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients in this study. METHODS: This is a retrospective, hospital-based, observational study. All patients with normal baseline QTc interval who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at two hospitals in Ohio, USA were included in this study. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients had QTc prolongation, and 210 patients continued to have normal QTc during hospitalization. The baseline QTc intervals were comparable in the two groups. Patients with QTc prolongation were older (mean age 67 vs. 60, P 0.003), more likely to have underlying cardiovascular disease (48% versus 26%, P 0.001), ischemic heart disease (29% versus 17%, P 0.026), congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (16% versus 8%, P 0.042), chronic kidney disease (23% versus 10%, P 0.005), and end-stage renal disease (12% versus 1%, P < 0.001). Patients with QTc prolongation were more likely to have received hydroxychloroquine (75% versus 59%, P 0.018), azithromycin (18% vs. 14%, P 0.034), a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (29% vs 7%, P < 0.001), more than 1 QT prolonging agents (59% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Patients who were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) were less likely to develop QTc prolongation (11% versus 26%, P 0.014). QTc prolongation was not associated with increased ventricular arrhythmias or mortality. CONCLUSION: Older age, ESRD, underlying cardiovascular disease, potential virus mediated cardiac injury, and drugs like hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, contribute to QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients. The role of ACEi in preventing QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients needs to be studied further.","Changal, Khalid; Paternite, David; Mack, Sean; Veria, Spiro; Bashir, Rehana; Patel, Mitra; Soni, Ronak; Ali, Muhammad; Mir, Tanveer; Sheikh, Mujeeb; Ramanathan, P Kasi",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,614

This review discusses various oral manifestations of Covid-19 reported in the literature along with possible underlying mechanisms. The reported manifestations include taste impairment, oral mucosal changes (petechiae, ulcers, plaque-like lesions, reactivation of herpes simplex virus 1(HSV1), geographical tongue and desquamative gingivitis) and dry mouth. The prominent location for mucosal lesions are tongue, palate and labial mucosa. The exact pathogenesis of these oral symptoms is not known. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors are expressed in abundance on oral mucosa allowing severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect them. Gustatory impairment along with olfactory changes is now listed as a symptom of Covid-19 by the World Health Organization, but further research is needed to confirm a link between reported additional oral symptoms and Covid-19.

383533,Timing of Intubation and Outcome in the Covid-19 Pandemic: Challenging the Concept of Permissive Hypoxemia,2020,"There is increasing empirical evidence that social distance and timing affect prosocial behavior after acute stress exposure. The present study focused on everyday moral decision-making after acute psychosocial stress and how it is influenced by effects of social closeness and timing. We exposed 40 young healthy men to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST, n = 20) or its non-stressful placebo version (PTSST, n = 20). Moral decision-making was assessed early (+10 until +30 min) and late (+75 until +95 min) after (P)TSST exposure by the Everyday Moral Conflict Situations (EMCS) Scale. The EMCS Scale requests altruistic versus egoistic responses to everyday moral conflict situations with varying closeness of target persons. Results revealed significantly higher total percentages of altruistic decisions in the stress than in the control condition and for scenarios involving socially close (e.g., mother) versus socially distant (e.g., stranger) protagonists, while the main effect of timing was nonsignificant. Only secondary analyses showed increased altruistic decision-making after acute stress exposure toward socially close but not toward distant protagonists at the early but not at the late point of measurement. Moreover, psychological stress responses and personality traits were significantly associated with EMCS scores. Positive correlations between cortisol levels and altruistic decision-making were descriptively observable, but did not reach statistical significance. In sum, our findings suggest increased altruistic decision-making toward socially close compared to socially distant protagonists and provide further evidence that acute stress influences decision-making in everyday moral conflict scenarios in a prosocial manner. Lay summary In order to investigate the effects of acute stress on everyday moral decision-making, 40 young healthy men were exposed to moderate psychosocial stress by the use of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) or its non-stressful placebo version and then completed a hypothetical everyday moral decision-making paradigm. Our findings provide evidence that acute stress exposure influences decision-making in everyday moral conflict situations in a prosocial manner. Furthermore, participants decided more altruistically in scenarios involving socially close (e.g., mother) versus socially distant (e.g., stranger) protagonists.","Singer, Nina; Binapfl, Julia; Sommer, Monika; Wüst, Stefan; Kudielka, Brigitte M",Stress,,614

Thus, candidate vaccines targeting the spike protein are currently being developed to prevent against infections. Approximately 44 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines are in clinical trials (phase I-III) and an additional 164 candidates are in preclinical stages. The efficacy data from phase I/II trials of lead candidate vaccines look very promising with virus-neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers in the range of 16.6-3906. Most recently, two SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have been granted the first emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S.; BNT162b2 has also been granted an EUA in the United Kingdom, Canada, and in the European Union. This review assesses whether SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines (with approved EUA or in phase III trials) meet the criteria for an ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The review concludes with expectations from phase III trials and recommendations for phase IV studies (post-vaccine approval).","Tumban, Ebenezer",Viruses,,614

The most effective surveillance system consists of doing massive tests. Nonetheless, many countries cannot afford this class of health campaigns due to limited resources. Thus, a transmission model is a viable alternative to study the dynamics of the pandemic. The most used are the Susceptible, Infected and Removed type models (SIR). In this study, we tackle the population estimation problem of the A-SIR model, which takes into account asymptomatic or undetected individuals. By means of an algebraic differential approach, we design a model-free (no copy system) reduced-order estimation algorithm (observer) to determine the different non-measured population groups. We study two types of estimation algorithms: Proportional and Proportional-Integral. Both shown fast convergence speed, as well as a minimal estimation error. Additionally, we introduce random fluctuations in our analysis to represent changes in the external conditions and which result in poor measurements. The numerical results reveal that both model-free estimators are robust despite the presence of these fluctuations. As a point of reference, we apply the classical Luenberger type observer to our estimation problem and compare the results. Finally, we consider real data of infected individuals in Mexico City, reported from February 2020 to March 2021, and estimate the non-measured populations. Our work's main goal is to proportionate a simple and therefore, an accessible methodology to estimate the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic from the available data, such that the competent authorities can propose more adequate health politics.","Martínez-Guerra, Rafael; Flores-Flores, Juan Pablo",Appl Math Comput,,614

386290,Expansion of telehealth in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: benefits and barriers,2021,"The pandemic of Coronavirus diseases occurred in the Republic of Korea from 19 January 2020. By March 2020, Korea had reported the second largest number of Coronavirus patients in the world. On the anniversary date (2021), however, with a 51.3 M population, Korea has had 73.115 K patients with 1.283 K deaths, and this stands at 86th in the world. On average, Korea has 14.3 patients per 10,000 people. Air-parcel trajectory analysis and airflows show that in the general westerly region, air parcels and pollutants could flow out and in all directions. This suggests initially that Coronaviruses from source areas in China could transmit to many sink regions and sectors including 228 subdivided counties in Korea. However, there were only relatively small numbers of Coronavirus patients in western sea sides of the Korean Peninsula in comparison with large numbers of Coronavirus disease patients in cities and in eastern sides. In particular, three counties in Korea, including Ong-jin, Mooju and Chang-heung, have zero patients of Coronavirus diseases. This suggests that a long-distance transmission of Coronavirus from Wuhan and other infected cities in China to western Korea likely did not occur. Moreover, there was no evidence on the potential transmission of Coronavirus from neighboring large cities to the above-mentioned isolated counties in Korea which are only 10 ~ 50 km away. In the biosphere, during the transmission stage, the inactivation of Coronavirus by UV rays appeared to occur effectively in 30 ~ 120 min, in agreement with the result of satellite and modeling studies. In turn, the air transmission of Coronaviruses and pollution from China and neighboring cities in Korea apparently had no impact to cause Coronavirus diseases at the 228 counties in Korea. The infection and spreading of Coronavirus diseases to other people in Korea mainly appeared to occur in confined indoor air environments. With the absence and lack of UV rays in indoor environments, Coronaviruses would be active there for hours or days longer than in the outdoor environments.","Chung, Y S; Kim, H S",Air Qual Atmos Health,,614
386534,"Maintaining Safety, Compliance, and Efficiency in Non-drug/device Research during the Covid-19 Pandemic",2020,"BACKGROUND: The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need to rapidly detect infected people. The challenge for clinical laboratories has been finding a high throughput, cost-efficient, and accurate testing method in the context of extraction reagents shortage on a global scale. To answer this need, we studied SARS-CoV-2 detection in oro-nasopharyngeal (ONP) swabs stored in Universal Transport Media (UTM) or in RNase-free water by rRT-PCR with Seegene Allplex&#8482; 2019-nCoV assay without RNA extraction. RESULTS: Optimal results were obtained when swabs stored in UTM were diluted 1/5 and 1/2 in RNase-free water. Thermal lysis before rRT-PCR testing slightly improved detection rate. In addition, proteinase K (PK) treatment allowed for a significant reduction of invalid results and increased sensitivity for detection of low viral load specimens. In a panel of positive samples with all 3 viral genes amplified and N gene Cycle threshold values (Ct values) from 15 to 40, our detection rate was 98.9% with PK and 94.4% without. In a challenging panel of low positive samples with only the N gene being detectable at Ct values > 30, detection rate was increased from 53.3 to 76.7% with the addition of PK, and invalid rate fell off from 18.3 to 0%. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our method reliably detects specimens with Ct values up to 35, whereas false negative samples become frequent above this range. Finally, we show that swabs should be stored at - 70 °C rather than 4 °C when testing cannot be performed within 72 h of collection. CONCLUSION: We successfully optimized the unextracted rRT-PCR process using the Seegene Allplex&#8482; 2019-nCoV assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in nasopharyngeal swabs. This improved method offers cost savings and turnaround time advantages compared to automated extraction, with high efficiency of detection that could play an important role in the surveillance of Covid-19.","Freppel, Wesley; Merindol, Natacha; Rallu, Fabien; Bergevin, Marco",Virol J,,614
386594,The COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore: what does it mean for arthroplasty?,2020,"Office-based workplaces are an important but understudied context for infectious disease transmission. We examined the feasibility of two different sensors (Opos and Bluetooth beacons) for collecting person-to-person contacts and hand hygiene in office-based workplaces. Opo is an interaction sensor that captures sensor-to-sensor interactions through ultrasonic frequencies, which correspond to face-to-face contacts between study participants. Opos were additionally used to measure hand hygiene events by affixing sensors to soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispensers. Bluetooth beacons were used in conjunction with a smartphone application and recorded proximity contacts between study participants. Participants in two office sites were followed for one-week in their workplace in March 2018. Contact patterns varied by time of day and day of the week. Face-to-face contacts were of shorter mean duration than proximity contacts. Supervisors had fewer proximity contacts but more face-to-face contacts than non-supervisors. Self-reported hand hygiene was substantively higher than sensor-collected hand hygiene events and duration of hand washing events was short (median: 9 seconds, range: 2.5-33 seconds). Given that office settings are key environments in which working age populations spend a large proportion of their time and interactions, a better characterization of empirical social networks and hand hygiene behaviors for workplace interactions are needed to mitigate outbreaks and prepare for pandemics. Our study demonstrates that implementing sensor technologies for tracking interactions and behaviors in offices is feasible and can provide new insights into real-world social networks and hygiene practices. We identified key social interactions, variability in hand hygiene, and differences in interactions by workplace roles. High-resolution network data will be essential for identifying the most effective ways to mitigate infectious disease transmission and develop pandemic preparedness plans for the workplace setting.","Zivich, Paul N; Huang, Will; Walsh, Ali; Dutta, Prabal; Eisenberg, Marisa; Aiello, Allison E",PLoS One,,614
387024,Adapting Orthopaedic Surgery Training Programs During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Future Directions,2020,"The convergence of the opioid epidemic and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created new health care challenges. The authors analyzed changes in clinical drug testing patterns and results at a national clinical laboratory, comparing data obtained before and during the pandemic. Testing for prescription and illicit drugs declined rapidly during the pandemic, with weekly test volumes falling by approximately 70% from the baseline period to the trough (the week beginning March 29) before rising in subsequent weeks. Among individuals tested, positivity increased by 35% for non-prescribed fentanyl and 44% for heroin during the pandemic. Positivity for non-prescribed fentanyl increased significantly among patients positive for other drugs: by 89% for specimens positive for amphetamines; 48% for benzodiazepines; 34% for cocaine; and 39% for opiates (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). These findings suggest significant increases in dangerous drug combinations. Positivity for non-prescribed use of many other drugs remained consistent or declined for some drugs, relative to pre-pandemic patterns. Models adjusting for potential confounding variables, including medication-assisted treatment and treatment at a substance use disorder facility indicated that the risk for non-prescribed fentanyl positivity rose by more than 50% during the pandemic. In summary, these findings demonstrate decreased drug testing overall, with increased positivity for high-risk drugs and dangerous drug combinations. The convergence of the drug abuse epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased need for health care and public health resources dedicated to supporting vulnerable patients and addressing the underlying causes of these disturbing trends.","Niles, Justin K; Gudin, Jeffrey; Radcliff, Jeff; Kaufman, Harvey W",Popul Health Manag,,614

BACKGROUND: Both ANL and healthy work environment (HWE) contribute to staff and patient outcomes. Our 1st study of these 2 variables revealed a positive relationship. Will this be upheld in a pandemic year? METHODS: More than 5000 nurses from a national sample participated in a cross-sectional, correlational, descriptive study using the Authentic Nurse Leadership Questionnaire, the Critical Elements of a Healthy Work Environment Scale, and a pandemic impact on practice question. RESULTS: Overall, nurses perceived ANL and HWE were present despite a high level of pandemic impact; however, when clinical nurses were separated from managers/directors, HWE was not present for frontline nurses. The moderate correlation of ANL and HWE was replicated in this larger study. CONCLUSIONS: This is the 2nd study of the positive relationship between ANL and HWE using these models, supporting ANL as an essential standard of a HWE. ANL was present for clinical nurses in a pandemic year signaling that nurse leaders rose to meet frontline leadership needs. HWE was present overall, but not for clinical nurses. Leadership is essential to work environments and outcomes especially in times of crisis and significant change.","Raso, Rosanne; Fitzpatrick, Joyce J; Masick, Kevin; Giordano-Mulligan, Marie; Sweeney, Cynthia D",J Nurs Adm,,614

Variability in length of hospital stay (LOS) was evident in this population. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to prompt discharge of effected patients in order to reduce contagion risk. LOS and discharge destination in COVID-19 negative patients has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the LOS and discharge destination during the COVID-19 outbreak and compare it with a similar cohort in preceding years. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted comparing a total of 182 consecutive fragility hip fracture patients operated on during the first COVID-19 outbreak to patients operated on in 2 preceding years. Data regarding demographic, co-morbidities, surgical management, hospitalization, as well as surgical and medical complications were retrieved from electronic charts. RESULTS: During the pandemic 67 fragility hip fracture patients were admitted (COVID group);55 and 60 patients were admitted during the same time periods in 2017 and 2018, respectively (control groups). All groups were of similar age and gender. Patients in the COVID group had significantly shorter LOS (7.2 ± 3.3 vs. 8.9 ± 4.9 days, P = 0.008) and waiting time for a rehabilitation facility (7.2 ± 3.1 vs. 9.3 ± 4.9 days, P = 0.003), but greater prevalence of delirium (17.9% vs. 7% of patients, P = 0.028). In hospital mortality did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS: LOS and time to rehabilitation were significantly shorter in the COVID group.

DESIGN: Systematic review. ELIGIBILITY: Eligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single centres or studied only patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and preprints were searched, without language restrictions, until 10 August, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact. DATA ANALYSIS: Risk of bias was assessed by adapting the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool, and a Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures and narrative synthesis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in service utilisation between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (eg, triage scores). RESULTS: 3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on >11 million services prepandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (IQR -51% to -20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42% (-53% to -32%), admissions 28% (-40% to -17%), diagnostics 31% (-53% to -24%) and for therapeutics 30% (-57% to -19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27 (45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no difference. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health systems reduce unnecessary care in the postpandemic recovery.

Materials and Methods: The age, gender, predominant symptoms during Covid, length of stay at home/hospital, and smoking status of patients who had Covid and had loss of taste and smell between July 2020 and December 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Patients with loss of taste and smell were significantly younger than those who did not. The majority were female patients, non-smokers, and patients needing significantly less hospitalization and receiving treatment at home. Among the accompanying symptoms, GIS symptoms were also significantly more common in this group. Conclusion: Loss of taste and smell is an important symptom in Covid-19 infection.

Our data should encourage ongoing efforts to reduce barriers in accessing medications for treatment, harm reduction interventions and additional education for trainees, primary care providers, and hospitalists alike. In the current climate, these interventions are critical to save the lives of patients with OUD.","Ivey, Noel; Clifton, Dana Cooley",J Opioid Manag,,614
393144,Schizophrenia and COVID-19 delirium,2020,"Introduction: Global emergence of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has clearly shown variable severity, mortality, and frequency between and within populations worldwide. These striking differences have made many biological variables attractive for future investigations. One of these variables, vitamin D, has been implicated in COVID-19 with rapidly growing scientific evidence.Areas covered: The review intended to systematically explore the sources, and immunomodulatory role of vitamin D in COVID-19. Search engines and data sources including Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, Scopus, and Web of Science were used for data collection. The search terms used were Vitamin D, COVID-19, immune system, and antiviral mechanism. Overall, 232 sources of information were collected and 188 were included in this review.Expert opinion: Interaction of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) triggers the cellular events to modulate the immune system by regulation of many genes. Vitamin D operates as a double-edged sword against COVID-19. First, in macrophages, it promotes the production of antimicrobial and antiviral proteins like ß-defensin 2 and cathelicidin, and these proteins inhibit the replication of viral particles and promote the clearance of virus from the cells by autophagy. Second, it suppresses cytokine storm and inflammatory processes in COVID-19.","Gilani, Sadaf Jamal; Bin-Jumah, May Nasser; Nadeem, Muhammad Shahid; Kazmi, Imran",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,614

The impact of surgical stress and anesthesia on predisposition to a new COVID-19 infection or exacerbation of the infection in a COVID-19 infected patient to be operated on is unknown. Although COVID-19 mortality is between 1-5%, most deaths have occurred in elderly patients with underlying cardiopulmonary conditions, most of them hypertensive, diabetic and obese, therefore, it should be specially attention in its handling. Carefull perioperative preparation and planning is key in successfully achieving adequate clinical care and maintaining the safety of the health team in a difficult and high risk moment. An additional role for the anesthesiologist, considering that he has the most experience in the management of the airway, is to support the emergency services for endotracheal intubation of patients who require ventilatory support, being a procedure with very specific protection recommendations. Therefore, there is a commitment as specialists, to know the subject thoroughly and protect ourselves along with the health team involved in saving lives during this contingency.","Garduño-López, Ana Lilia; Guido-Guerra, Ricardo Eli; Guizar-Rangel, María Teresa; Acosta-Nava, Víctor Manuel; Domínguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Alvarez-Bobadilla, Gloria",Rev.

393224,COVID-19-related disruptions to routine vaccination services in India: a survey of paediatric providers,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis. Economically, lockdowns across Australia have devastated business and industry, creating immediate spikes in under- and unemployment. These impacts intersect with the precarious labour market of casualised and ""gig"" economy work, where young workers constitute an established and substantial group. While negatively impacting upon many young people's lives, in recent decades precarious employment has also been normalised for young people as they are encouraged to understand themselves as self-reliant and entrepreneurial in their working lives. Yet, these workers have been largely abandoned in the government's economic response to COVID-19. The economic impact and government response to the pandemic substantially disadvantage young people. This article analyses the impact of new government initiatives: the ""JobKeeper"" wage subsidy scheme, ""JobSeeker"" payments and early access to superannuation, ""JobMaker"" economic recovery plan and the redesign of university fees. These initiatives compound preexisting youth policy of low welfare levels, youth wages and high university fees to economically burden young people. Contrasting the repeated expression of anything pandemic related as ""unprecedented"", we argue that the economic abandonment of young people in the immediate COVID-19 crisis continues a decades-long precedent in Australia of economically disadvantaging young people.","O039,; Keeffe, Patrick; Johnson, Belinda; Daley, Kathryn",Australian journal of social issues,,614
393366,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on weight status and factors associated with weight gain among adults in Massachusetts,2021,"Current recommendations for the management of patients with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) are largely based on evidence from resource-rich settings, mostly located in high-income countries. It is often unpractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings. We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of patients with COVID-19 and AKI in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For the prevention of AKI among patients with COVID-19 in LMICs, we recommend using isotonic crystalloid solutions for expansion of intravascular volume, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using a conservative fluid management strategy in patients with respiratory failure. For the diagnosis of AKI, we suggest that any patient with COVID-19 presenting with an elevated serum creatinine level without available historical values be considered as having AKI. If serum creatinine testing is not available, we suggest that patients with proteinuria should be considered to have possible AKI. We suggest expansion of the use of point-of-care serum creatinine and salivary urea nitrogen testing in community health settings, as funding and availability allow. For the management of patients with AKI and COVID-19 in LMICS, we recommend judicious use of intravenous fluid resuscitation. For patients requiring dialysis who do not have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we suggest using peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice, where available and feasible. For patients requiring dialysis who do have ARDS, we suggest using hemodialysis, where available and feasible, to optimize fluid removal. We suggest using locally produced PD solutions when commercially produced solutions are unavailable or unaffordable.","Rudd, Kristina E; Cizmeci, Elif A; Galli, Gabriela M; Lundeg, Ganbold; Schultz, Marcus J; Papali, Alfred",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,614
393367,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on weight status and factors associated with weight gain among adults in Massachusetts,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in unprecedented time. However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population willing to be vaccinated. This observational population-based study examines intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. METHODS: In November 2020, longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547 U.S. adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Participants reported being willing, undecided, and unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19 across 13 assessments conducted from April to October 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against COVID-19 were also assessed on a 4-point Likert-type scale. RESULTS: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the proportion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%). The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those without a degree (undecided: RR=2.47, 95% CI=2.04, 3.00; unwilling: RR=1.92, 95% CI=1.67, 2.20), Black participants (undecided: RR=2.18, 95% CI=1.73, 2.74; unwilling: RR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63, 2.42), and female participants (undecided: RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.20, 1.65; unwilling: RR=1.29, 95% CI=1.14, 1.46). Participants who were older or were on higher incomes were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate. Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common. CONCLUSIONS: Intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 have declined rapidly during the pandemic, and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",Am. j. prev. med,,614
393475,Compliance and Psychological Impact of Quarantine in Children and Adolescents due to Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. Although human disease is often asymptomatic, some develop severe illnesses such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. There is an urgent need for a vaccine to prevent its rapid spread as asymptomatic infections accounting for up to 40% of transmission events. Here we further evaluated an inactivated rabies vectored SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine CORAVAX in a Syrian hamster model. CORAVAX adjuvanted with MPLA-AddaVax, a TRL4 agonist, induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and generated a strong Th1-biased immune response. Vaccinated hamsters were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs and nasal turbinates three days after challenge with SARS-CoV-2. CORAVAX also prevented lung disease, as indicated by the significant reduction in lung pathology. This study highlights CORAVAX as a safe, immunogenic, and efficacious vaccine that warrants further assessment in human trials.","Kurup, Drishya; Malherbe, Delphine C; Wirblich, Christoph; Lambert, Rachael; Ronk, Adam J; Zabihi Diba, Leila; Bukreyev, Alexander; Schnell, Matthias J",PLoS Pathog,,614

Little research has addressed potential inequalities in access, with no research on variations before and since COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore inequalities in social support service usage before and since the pandemic. METHODS: Unpaid carers and people living with dementia were interviewed over the phone about their experiences of accessing social support services before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcripts were analysed for key themes using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifty participants (42 unpaid carers; eight people living with dementia) were interviewed, and five themes identified: (1) Service issues; (2) Access issues; (3) Relying on own initiative; (4) New inequalities due to COVID-19; and (5) Missing out on the benefits of support services. Participants reported transport, finances, and location as factors reducing their ability to access support service pre-COVID, with inequalities remaining and at times exacerbated since. Carers and people living with dementia also reported struggling with accessing basic necessities during COVID, including food and medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the benefits of accessing support services, resourced procedures and facilities are needed to maintain access to support services with more accessible remote support provision, enabling people from all backgrounds to access the care they need.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Tetlow, Hilary; Ward, Kym; Shenton, Justine; Cannon, Jacqueline; Butchard, Sarah; Komuravelli, Aravind; Gaughan, Anna; Eley, Ruth; Rogers, Carol; Rajagopal, Manoj; Limbert, Stan; Callaghan, Steve; Whittington, Rosie; Shaw, Lisa; Gabbay, Mark",Int J Equity Health,,614

394890,Comprehensive review of guidelines to practice prosthodontic and implant procedures during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Purpose: In a classroom, the teacher and other students play an important role in regulating individual and group learning. However, the sudden shift to remote and online learning, as a result of social isolation during COVID-19, has created a social disconnect, making these immediate regulatory supports less accessible. A need was identified for strategies to support collaborative learning regulation when learning remotely and online. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on models of self-, co, and socially shared learning regulation, a series of resources were developed for students, teachers and parents to support effective online collaborative learning. These strategies embedded evidence-based principles of learning drawn from the learning sciences, including elaboration, retrieval, dual coding and concrete examples. Findings: A set of ten student resources have been developed, accompanied by supporting information and strategies for teachers and families. These resources have been shared with schools across Australia. Originality/value: These evidence-based strategies are valuable, as they are addressing an identified urgent community need. Based on the science of learning, these strategies are original in synthesising effective learning techniques with the three forms of learning regulation to encourage student connection and collaboration in online and remote learning.","MacMahon, Stephanie; Leggett, Jack; Carroll, Annemaree",inform.Learn.Sci,,614

In contrast to SARS, some SARS-CoV-2-infected people can be asymptomatic or have only mild nonspecific symptoms. Furthermore, there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may be infectious during an asymptomatic incubation period. With the discovery that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in plasma or serum, blood safety is worthy of consideration. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a nucleic acid test (NAT) screening system for SARS-CoV-2 targeting nucleocapsid protein (N) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF 1ab) gene that could screen 5076 samples every 24 hours. The 2019 novel coronavirus RNA standard was used to evaluate linearity of standard curves. Diagnostic sensitivity and reproducibility were evaluated using artificial SARS-CoV-2. Specificity was evaluated with 61 other respiratory pathogens. Diagnostic performance was evaluated by testing two sputum and nine oropharyngeal swab specimens. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to screen SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood donor specimens collected during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Chengdu. RESULTS: Limits of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for N and ORF 1ab gene were 12.5 and 27.58 copies/mL, respectively. Intra-assay and interassay for the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay based on cycle threshold were acceptably low. No cross-reactivity was observed with other respiratory virus and bacterial isolates. The overall agreement value between the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay and clinical diagnostic results was 100%. A total of 16 287 blood specimens collected from blood donors during SARS-CoV-2 surveillance were tested negative.

398933,Playing and virtual reality: Teleanalysis with children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT Abstract: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted many activities along agri-food supply chains in developing countries and posed unprecedented challenges in particular to small and medium agri-food enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on a survey of 166 Egyptian agri-food SMEs, this study investigates differences in- and determinants of COVID-19 business risk perception among these enterprises. The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID-19. The findings of the study imply that the “just-in-time” approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri-food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID-19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri-food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices. More so, they can help design effective policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on Egyptian agri-food SMEs and build up their resilience to future pandemics and shocks","Esmat, A.; Abu Hatab, A.; Lagerkvist, C.

399594,Safe school reopening under COVID-19 restrictions - Measures implemented in San Andrea Independent School in Malta,2020,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted medical care, impacting prescribing of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Understanding these patterns can help address barriers to care. Objective: To evaluate how prescribing of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic among both new and existing patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, use of opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder from March 18 to September 1, 2020, was projected using a national database of retail prescriptions from January 1, 2018, to March 3, 2020. Actual prescribing was compared with projected levels for all, existing, and new patients. Exposures: The data include prescriptions to patients independent of insurance status or type and cover 90% of retail prescriptions, 70% of mail-order prescriptions, and 70% of nursing home prescriptions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Outcomes included total number of prescriptions, total morphine milligram equivalents, mean morphine milligram equivalents per prescription, mean dispensed units per prescription, and number of patients filling prescriptions. Results: A total of 452â¯691â¯261 prescriptions for opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder were analyzed for 90â¯420â¯353 patients (50â¯921â¯535 female patients [56%]; mean [SD] age, 49 [20] years). From March 18 to May 19, 2020, 1877 million total morphine milligram equivalents of opioid analgesics were prescribed weekly vs 1843 million projected, a ratio of 102% (95% prediction interval [PI], 94%-111%; P = .71). The weekly number of opioid-naive patients receiving opioids was 370â¯051 vs 564â¯929 projected, or 66% of projected (95% PI, 63%-68%; P < .001). Prescribing of buprenorphine was as projected for existing patients, while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 9865 vs 12â¯008 projected, or 82% (95% PI, 76%-88%; P < .001). From May 20 to September 1, 2020, opioid prescribing for new patients returned to 100% of projected (95% PI, 96%-104%; P = .95), while the number of new patients receiving buprenorphine weekly was 10â¯436 vs 11â¯613 projected, or 90% (95% PI, 83%-97%; P = .009). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, existing patients receiving opioid analgesics and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder generally maintained access to these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid prescriptions for opioid-naive patients decreased briefly and then rebounded, while initiation of buprenorphine remained at a low rate through August 2020. Reductions in treatment entry may be associated with increased overdose deaths.","Currie, Janet M; Schnell, Molly K; Schwandt, Hannes; Zhang, Jonathan",JAMA Netw Open,,614

400862,Visual Dermatology: Acral Erythemato-purpuric Lesions During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a significant number of mortalities worldwide. COVID-19 poses a serious threat to human life. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are diverse and severe and 20% of infected patients are reported to be in a critical condition. A loss in lung function and pulmonary fibrosis are the main manifestations of patients with the severe form of the disease. The lung function is affected, even after recovery, thereby greatly affecting the psychology and well-being of patients, and significantly reducing their quality of life. METHODS: Participants must meet the following simultaneous inclusion criteria: over 18 years of age, should have recovered from severe or critical COVID-19 cases, should exhibit pulmonary fibrosis after recovery, and should exhibit Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome as indicated in the system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The eligible candidates will be randomized into treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive modern medicine (pirfenidone) plus TCM whereas the control group will be administered modern medicine plus TCM placebo. The lung function index will be continuously surveyed and recorded. By comparing the treatment effect between the two groups, the study intend to explore whether TCM can improve the effectiveness of modern medicine in patients with pulmonary fibrosis arising as a sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary fibrosis is one of fatal sequelae for some severe or critical COVID-19 cases, some studies reveal that pirfenidone lead to a delay in the decline of forced expiratory vital capacity, thereby reducing the mortality partly. Additionally, although TCM has been proven to be efficacious in treating pulmonary fibrosis, its role in treating pulmonary fibrosis related COVID-19 has not been explored. Hence, a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective clinical trial has been designed and will be conducted to determine if a new comprehensive treatment for pulmonary fibrosis related to COVID-19 is feasible and if it can improve the quality of life of patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000033284) on 26th May 2020 (prospective registered).","Lu, Zhen-Hui; Yang, Chun-Li; Yang, Gai-Ge; Pan, Wen-Xu; Tian, Li-Guang; Zheng, Jin-Xin; Lv, Shan; Zhang, Shao-Yan; Zheng, Pei-Yong; Zhang, Shun-Xian",Infect Dis Poverty,,614

The new estimator allows to consider the lasso penalty as a special case. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we test the performance on several underlying network structures and four different multivariate distributions: Gaussian, t-Student with 3 and 20 degrees of freedom and contaminated Gaussian. Simulation analysis shows that the 2-stage estimator performs best for heavy-tailed data and it is also robust to distribution misspecification, both in terms of identification of the sparsity patterns and numerical accuracy. Empirical results on real-world data focus on the estimation of the European banking network during the Covid-19 pandemic. We show that the new estimator can provide interesting insights both for the development of network indicators, such as network strength, to identify crisis periods and for the detection of banking network properties, such as centrality and level of interconnectedness, that might play a relevant role in setting up adequate risk management and mitigation tools.","Bernardini, Davide; Paterlini, Sandra; Taufer, Emanuele",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10583v1.pdf,614

403090,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on care of oncological patients: experience of a cancer center in a Latin American pandemic epicenter,2021,"Preliminary evidence suggests that climate may modulate the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Yet it remains unclear whether seasonal and geographic variations in climate can substantially alter the pandemic trajectory, given that high susceptibility is a core driver. Here, we use a climate-dependent epidemic model to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by probing different scenarios based on known coronavirus biology. We find that although variations in weather may be important for endemic infections, during the pandemic stage of an emerging pathogen, the climate drives only modest changes to pandemic size. A preliminary analysis of nonpharmaceutical control measures indicates that they may moderate the pandemic-climate interaction through susceptible depletion. Our findings suggest that without effective control measures, strong outbreaks are likely in more humid climates and summer weather will not substantially limit pandemic growth.","Baker, Rachel E; Yang, Wenchang; Vecchi, Gabriel A; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Grenfell, Bryan T",Science,,614

Little was known in March 2020 about SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, serological conversion, asymptomatic transmission or risk factors for transmission, particularly in military populations. Early identification, swift implementation of control measures, and investigation of a potential outbreak with Public Health England in an Army barracks following one confirmed case and 11 symptomatic personnel, allowed exploration of these questions.MethodsAll adult personnel, including civilians working or living at the Barracks were invited to participate at initial visit and day-36 follow-up. Participants completed a symptom and transmission risk factor questionnaire;gave nasal and throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, infectious virus isolation, whole genome sequencing (WGS);and blood samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 and neutralising antibodies. Risk factors were statistically analysed using STATA v15.0, described in univariate analysis by relative risks and assessed using Fisher’s Exact test.ResultsAt first visit, 24/304 (8%) participants were RT-PCR positive and infectious virus recovered from 7/24 (29%). Seropositivity was 7% (19/285). 64% of all positive participants were asymptomatic. WGS identified more than three separate introductions, and evidence of asymptomatic transmission through genetically indistinguishable samples. Significant transmission risk factors included contact with a confirmed case, female gender, and two-person shared bathrooms. After 36 days, there were no new cases, all previously RT-PCR positive participants seroconverted, but not all developed neutralising antibodies;seropositivity was 13% (25/193).ConclusionsMost positive military personnel were asymptomatic, but those with symptoms reported ageusia or anosmia. Some RT-PCR positive participants, but none who were simultaneously positive for neutralising antibodies, had infectious virus. Initial infection rates were five times general London estimates, but effective implementation of control measures including enhanced cleaning, social distancing, and prompt isolation mitigated on-site spread. 36 days later seropositivity was below London’s rate. Ongoing risks include new COVID-19 introduction into the barracks from off-site personnel, asymptomatic transmission between cases and contacts, and use of two-person bathrooms.","Taylor, Hannah Ross David Wall William",BMJ Military Health,,614
403618,Impact of the Lockdown Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in the Use of Combined Hormonal Oral Contraception in Spain – Results of a National Survey: Encovid,2021,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a unique challenge to diagnostic laboratories. There are preliminary studies correlating qRT-PCR results from different materials to clinical outcomes, yet, comparability is limited due to the plethora of different assays used for diagnostics. In this study we evaluate clinical performance and linear range for the SARS-CoV-2 IVD (cobas6800/8800 system, a fully automated sample-to-result platform) in different clinically relevant matrix materials outside official specifications. METHODS: Assay performance was assessed in human plasma, BAL/BL and transport medium following chemical inactivation. For analytical evaluation, respective matrix materials were spiked with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in ten-fold dilution series. The efficacy of chemical inactivation by guanidine hydrochloride solution was confirmed in cell culture infectivity experiments. For correlation, a total of 289 predetermined clinical samples including respiratory swabs, plasma and lower respiratory tract specimens were subjected to the SARS-CoV-2 IVD test and results were compared. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD showed excellent linearity over four to six log steps depending on matrix material. Chemical inactivation resulted in a reduction in plaque forming units of at least 3.5 log steps, while having no significant impact on assay performance. Inter-run consistency from three different testing sites demonstrated excellent comparability of RT-PCR results (maximum deviation was 1.53 CT). Clinical evaluation for respiratory swabs showed very good agreement with the comparator assay (Positive agreement 95.7 %, negative agreement 98.9 %). CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 IVD test for the cobas6800/8800 systems offers excellent linear range and inter-run consistency for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in different matrices outside official specifications.","Nörz, Dominik; Frontzek, André; Eigner, Ulrich; Oestereich, Lisa; Wichmann, Dominic; Kluge, Stefan; Fischer, Nicole; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Clin Virol,,614

OBJECTIVE: To describe the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care routine of a tertiary hospital, which is a regional reference in cardiology and oncology. METHODS: Cross-sectional cohort study. We conducted a survey of medical visits from March 23, 2020 (when local commerce was closed) to April 23, 2020 (P20), in comparison with the same period in 2019 (P19). RESULTS: We found decreases in the number of cardiology consultations, exercise tests, Holter, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram (90%, 84%, 94%, 92%, 94%, and 81%, respectively). In relation to cardiac surgery and cardiac catheterization, there were 48% and 60% decreases, respectively. There was an increase in the number of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (33%) and definitive pacemaker implantations (29%). There were 97 admissions to the ICU during P19, in contrast with 78 during P20, a 20% decrease. Visits to the cardiac emergency room (45%) and admissions to the cardiology ward (36%) also decreased. The decrease in oncology consultations was 30%. Chemotherapy sessions decreased from 1,944 to 1,066 (45%), and radiotherapy sessions decreased by 19%.

403911,Telemedicine during Covid-19 pandemic: Advantage or critical issue?,2020,"As vaccines against COVID-19 are scarce, many countries have developed vaccination prioritisation strategies focusing on ethical and epidemiological considerations. However, public acceptance of such strategies should be monitored to ensure successful implementation. In an experiment with N=1379 German participants, we investigated whether the public's vaccination allocation preferences matched the prioritisation strategy approved by the German government. Results revealed different allocations. While the government had top-prioritised vulnerable people (being of high age or accommodated in nursing homes for the elderly), participants preferred exclusive allocation of the first available vaccines to medical staff and personnel caring for the elderly. Interestingly, allocation preferences did not change when participants were told how many individuals were included in each group. As differences between allocation policies and public preferences can affect trust in the government and threaten the social contract between generations, we discuss possible strategies to align vaccination prioritisations.","Sprengholz, Philipp; Korn, Lars; Eitze, Sarah; Betsch, Cornelia",J. med. ethics,,614
404074,Sources of information about COVID-19 in Latin American medical students and healthcare workers,2021,"CONTEXT: Coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) diagnostics require understanding of how predictive values depend on sensitivity, specificity, and especially, low prevalence. Clear expectations, high sensitivity and specificity, and manufacturer disclosure will facilitate excellence of tests. OBJECTIVES: To derive mathematical equations for designing and interpreting COVID-19 tests, assess Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization and Health Canada minimum requirements, establish sensitivity and specificity tiers, and enhance clinical performance in low prevalence settings. DESIGN: PubMed and other sources generated articles on COVID-19 testing and prevalence. EndNote X9.1 consolidated references. Mathematica and open access software helped prove equations, perform recursive calculations, graph multivariate relationships, and visualize patterns, including a new relationship, predictive value geometric mean-squared. RESULTS: Derived equations were used to illustrate shortcomings of COVID-19 diagnostics in low prevalence. Visual logistics helped establish sensitivity/specificity tiers. FDA/Canada's 90% sensitivity, 95% specificity minimum requirements generate excessive false positives at low prevalence. False positives exceed true positives at <5.3% prevalence, or if sensitivity is improved to 100% and specificity to 98%, at <2% prevalence. Recursive testing improves predictive value. Three tiers emerged from these results. With 100% sensitivity, physicians can select desired predictive values, then input local prevalence, to determine suitable specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding low prevalence impact will help healthcare providers meet COVID-19 needs for effective testing.

However, the specific active compounds responsible for the individual pharmacological effects of in R. rugosa extract (95% EtOH) remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that terpenoid structure, the most abundant constituents in R. rugosa extract, are responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity. We investigated the phytochemical substituents (compounds 1-13) and newly purified 11-methoxy polisin A, and 13-methoxy bisaborosaol F using NMR and ESI-MS and to screened their effects on NO production in LPS-induced macrophages. Rugosic acid A (RA) induced to ameliorate NO production, iNOS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with the NF-&#954;B. And, RA suppressed IL-6 secretion and IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation in LPS-mediated inflammation. In addition, RA was evaluated in LPS-mediated acute lung injury (ALI) model similar to acute pneumonia. Our results suggested that RA was suppressed to translocate nuclear NF-&#954;B and IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation. Finally, RA led to amelioration of ALI by decreasing myeloperoxidase (MPO) and inhibiting phosphorylation of NF-&#954;B and STAT3. Our group originally found that R. rugosa extract had new methoxy compounds and RA may be alternative natural agent for acute pneumonia similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome by coronavirus.","Kim, Kang-Hoon; Park, Ye-Ji; Jang, Hyun-Jae; Lee, Seung-Jae; Lee, Soyoung; Yun, Bong-Sik; Lee, Seung Woong; Rho, Mun-Chual",Phytother. res,,614

The aim of the present study was to analyze how physical activity (PA) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet among employees participating in the Healthy Cities program have been affected during confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample was composed of 297 employees from 40 leading companies based in Spain, who participated in the 5th edition of the Sanitas ""Healthy Cities"" challenge. The participants (148 women and 149 men), aged between 24 and 63 years old (M = 42.76; SD = 7.79) completed the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) questionnaire to measure adherence to the Mediterranean diet before and during the pandemic. Pearson &#967;2 tests revealed that workers were more likely to show sedentary behaviors during the pandemic than before (83.5% vs. 66.7%). Additionally, they were more likely to reach high levels of PA (51.2% vs. 64%), and Wilcoxon tests revealed that energy expenditure measured in Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) was higher during the pandemic (4199.03 METs) than before (3735.32 METs), due to an increase in moderate PA. Lastly, a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet during the pandemic (76.4%) than before (54.5%) was reported. The findings of this investigation suggest a positive effect of working from home for employees involved in a health-promotion program, and highlight the relevance of this kind of action among this population.","Franco, Evelia; Urosa, Jesús; Barakat, Rubén; Refoyo, Ignacio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,614

Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays for IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated their performance using 128 pre-pandemic plasmas (negative controls) and 104 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 5 were asymptomatic, 51 had mild symptoms and 48 were hospitalized. Pre-existing IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S proteins were detected in negative controls suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. The best performing antibody/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 95.78% at &#8805;14 days and 95.65% at &#8805;21 days since the onset of symptoms, with AUC of 0.977 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple markers as assessed by qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth and versatility to accurately detect low-level antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens in a population. Our assays will allow gaining insights into antibody correlates of immunity and their kinetics, required for vaccine development to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dobaño, Carlota; Vidal, Marta; Santano, Rebeca; Jiménez, Alfons; Chi, Jordi; Barrios, Diana; Ruiz-Olalla, Gemma; Rodrigo Melero, Natalia; Carolis, Carlo; Parras, Daniel; Serra, Pau; Martínez de Aguirre, Paula; Carmona-Torre, Francisco; Reina, Gabriel; Santamaria, Pere; Mayor, Alfredo; García-Basteiro, Alberto; Izquierdo, Luis; Aguilar, Ruth; Moncunill, Gemma",J. clin. microbiol,,614

408934,The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Patients in the United States: A Multicenter Update to the Previous Survey,2021,"The most frequent form of dementia is Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a severe progressive neurological pathology in which the main cognitive functions of an individual are compromised. Recent studies have found that loneliness and living in isolation are likely to cause an acceleration in the cognitive decline associated with AD. Therefore, understanding social behaviours of AD patients is crucial to promote sociability, thus delaying cognitive decline, preserving independence, and providing a good quality of life. In this work, we analyze the localization data of AD patients living in assisted care homes to gather insights about the social dynamics among them. We use localization data collected by a system based on iBeacon technology comprising two components: a network of antennas scattered throughout the facility and a Bluetooth bracelet worn by the patients. We redefine the Relational Index to capture wandering and casual encounters, these being common phenomena among AD patients, and use the notions of Relational and Popularity Indexes to model, visualize and understand the social behaviour of AD patients. We leverage the data analyses to build predictive tools and applications to enhance social activities scheduling and sociability monitoring and promotion, with the ultimate aim of providing patients with a better quality of life. Predictions and visualizations act as a support for caregivers in activity planning to maximize treatment effects and, hence, slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We present the Community Behaviour Prediction Table (CBPT), a tool to visualize the estimated values of sociability among patients and popularity of places within a facility. Finally, we show the potential of the system by analyzing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown time-frame between February and June 2020 in a specific facility. Through the use of the indexes, we evaluate the effects of the pandemic on the behaviour of the residents, observing no particular impact on sociability even though social distancing was put in place.","Bellini, Gloria; Cipriano, Marco; Comai, Sara; De Angeli, Nicola; Gargano, Jacopo Pio; Gianella, Matteo; Goi, Gianluca; Ingrao, Giovanni; Masciadri, Andrea; Rossi, Gabriele; Salice, Fabio",Sensors (Basel),,614

Electrochemical behavior of V. Arctostaphylos extract of dried fruit was performed by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry in aqueous solution. The results show that the level of delphinidin 3-O-glucoside (D3-OG) compound is higher than petunidin 3-O-glucoside (P3-OG) and malvidin 3-O-glucoside (M3-OG) level. This extract has a high solubility in water, and the potential-pH diagram indicates that the D3-OG capable oxidized to D3-OGOX with two electron/two proton process. D3-OG compound has a high antioxidant power because of the oxidation peak potential is low. Furthermore, total antioxidant capacity (1.475 C g-1) was determined by charges under of first oxidation peak. The antioxidant activity of three anthocyanins against Xanthine oxidase, Myeloperoxidase, NADPH oxidase, cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2B4 (ROS generation enzymes) has been performed through molecular docking studies. The results indicated that all the anthocyanins (D3-OG, P3-OG and M3-OG) bound exclusively to the binding site of ROS generation enzymes and have a remarkable role in suppressing the destructive effects of oxidative stress in the biological system of the human body. Also, D3-OG as a major anthocyanin of Vaccinium Arctostaphylos L. extract has an inhibition effect against the COVID-19 outbreak.

The present study provides data from a German cohort for over 20 years. The aim was to examine how the frequency of experiencing unemployment affects life satisfaction and whether their relationship changes over time. METHODS: In the Saxon Longitudinal Study, an age-homogeneous sample was surveyed annually from 1987 to 2016. Since 1996, 355 people (54% female) have been examined for issues related to unemployment. Life satisfaction was measured with both the Global Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Questions on Life SatisfactionModules questionnaire. RESULTS: In 1996, the participants were 23 years old and 50% of the sample was affected by unemployment. At all 16 different measuring points, participants who were never unemployed indicated higher life satisfaction than those who were once unemployed. The repeatedly unemployed consistently reported the lowest values of life satisfaction. In each year, there were significant differences with small to medium effect sizes. CONCLUSION: Our results support the notion that the adverse effects of unemployment on life satisfaction increase with the time spent unemployed. In 2016, only 2% of the cohort were currently unemployed, but differences between people with and without unemployment experience still exist. This indicates that the negative effect of the unemployment experience will last for a very long time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the effect so persistently at so many measurement points for over 20 years.","Richter, Ernst Peter; Brähler, Elmar; Stöbel-Richter, Yve; Zenger, Markus; Berth, Hendrik",Health Qual Life Outcomes,,614

413746,Assessment and management of anorexia nervosa during COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a sustained psychological impact on healthcare workers. We assessed individual characteristics related to changes in emotional exhaustion and psychological distress over time. METHODS: A survey of diverse hospital staff measured emotional exhaustion (Maslach Burnout Inventory) and psychological distress (K6) in Fall 2020 (T1) and Winter 2021 (T2). Relationships between occupational, personal, and psychological variables were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Of 539 T1 participants, 484 (89.9%) completed T2. Emotional exhaustion differed by occupational role (F = 7.3, p < .001; greatest in nurses), with increases over time in those with children (F = 8.5, p = .004) or elders (F = 4.0, p = .047). Psychological distress was inversely related to pandemic self-efficacy (F = 110.0, p < .001), with increases over time in those with children (F = 7.0, p = .008). Severe emotional exhaustion occurred in 41.1% (95%CI 36.6-45.4) at T1 and 49.8% (95%CI 45.4-54.2) at T2 (McNemar test p < .001). Psychological distress occurred in 9.7% (95%CI 7.1-12.2) at T1 and 11.6% (95%CI 8.8-14.4) at T2 (McNemar test p = .33). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers' psychological burden is high and rising as the pandemic persists. Ongoing support is warranted, especially for nurses and those with children and elders at home. Modifiable protective factors, restorative sleep and self-efficacy, merit special attention.","Maunder, Robert G; Heeney, Natalie D; Kiss, Alex; Hunter, Jonathan J; Jeffs, Lianne P; Ginty, Leanne; Johnstone, Jennie; Loftus, Carla A; Wiesenfeld, Lesley A",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,614

We quantify such disruptions, focusing on maternal and child health, in eight sub-Saharan countries. Service volumes are extracted from administrative systems for 63 954 facilities in eight countries: Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Somalia. Using an interrupted time series design and an ordinary least squares regression model with facility-level fixed effects, we analyze data from January 2018 to February 2020 to predict what service utilization levels would have been in March-July 2020 in the absence of the pandemic, accounting for both secular trends and seasonality. Estimates of disruption are derived by comparing the predicted and observed service utilization levels during the pandemic period. All countries experienced service disruptions for at least 1 month, but the magnitude and duration of the disruptions vary. Outpatient consultations and child vaccinations were the most commonly affected services and fell by the largest margins. We estimate a cumulative shortfall of 5 149 491 outpatient consultations and 328 961 third-dose pentavalent vaccinations during the 5 months in these eight countries. Decreases in maternal health service utilization are less generalized, although significant declines in institutional deliveries, antenatal care and postnatal care were detected in some countries. There is a need to better understand the factors determining the magnitude and duration of such disruptions in order to design interventions that would respond to the shortfall in care. Service delivery modifications need to be both highly contextualized and integrated as a core component of future epidemic response and planning.","Shapira, Gil; Ahmed, Tashrik; Drouard, Salomé Henriette Paulette; Amor Fernandez, Pablo; Kandpal, Eeshani; Nzelu, Charles; Wesseh, Chea Sanford; Mohamud, Nur Ali; Smart, Francis; Mwansambo, Charles; Baye, Martina L; Diabate, Mamatou; Yuma, Sylvain; Ogunlayi, Munirat; Rusatira, Rwema Jean De Dieu; Hashemi, Tawab; Vergeer, Petra; Friedman, Jed",Health Policy Plan,,614

Mandatory social and physical distancing measures (SPDM) were introduced on 23 March 2020 to attempt to limit transmission.AimTo describe the impact of SPDM on COVID-19 activity as detected through the different surveillance systems.MethodsData from national population surveys, web-based indicators, syndromic surveillance, sentinel swabbing, respiratory outbreaks, secondary care admissions and mortality indicators from the start of the epidemic to week 18 2020 were used to identify the timing of peaks in surveillance indicators relative to the introduction of SPDM. This timing was compared with median time from symptom onset to different stages of illness and levels of care or interactions with healthcare services.ResultsThe impact of SPDM was detected within 1 week through population surveys, web search indicators and sentinel swabbing reported by onset date. There were detectable impacts on syndromic surveillance indicators for difficulty breathing, influenza-like illness and COVID-19 coding at 2, 7 and 12 days respectively, hospitalisations and critical care admissions (both 12 days), laboratory positivity (14 days), deaths (17 days) and nursing home outbreaks (4 weeks).ConclusionThe impact of SPDM on COVID-19 activity was detectable within 1 week through community surveillance indicators, highlighting their importance in early detection of changes in activity.

421004,Rational perioperative utilisation and management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Challenges arise when treatment to improve maternal health brings the possibility of risk to fetal health. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is the most recent, but hardly the only, example. Because pregnant patients are often specifically excluded from trials of new therapies, this is often the dilemma that patients and providers face when considering new treatments. In this study, we used the COVID-19 vaccine as an exemplar to question the broader issue of how society, in general, and obstetricians, in particular, should balance obligations to pregnant women's right of access to new therapeutic agents with the physician's desire to protect the fetus from potential risks. We will argue that in almost all circumstances (with few exceptions, as will also be discussed), maternal benefit and respect for autonomy create the uncertainty that absent safety data bring. Consequently, if pregnant women choose to try new interventions and treatments, such as the COVID-19 vaccination, they should be offered those new regimens and their decision supported. In addition, we will argue that the right solution to avoid the dilemma of absent data is to include pregnant individuals in clinical trials studying new treatments, drugs, and other therapies. We will also discuss the basis for our opinion, which are mainstream obstetrical ethics, precedents in law (supreme court ruling that forbids companies to exclude women from jobs that might pose a risk to the fetus), and historic events (thalidomide). The ethical framework includes the supposition that sacrifice to improve fetal outcome is a virtue and not a mandate. Denying a pregnant patient treatment because of threats to their life can create absurd and paradoxical consequences. Either requiring abortion or premature delivery before proceeding with treatments to optimize maternal health, or risking a patient's own life and ability to parent a child by delaying treatment brings clear and significant risks to fetal and/or neonatal outcomes. With rare exceptions, properly and ethically balancing such consequential actions cannot be undertaken without considering the values and goals of the pregnant patient. Therefore, active participation of both the pregnant patient and their physician in shared decision making is needed.","Minkoff, Howard; Ecker, Jeffrey",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,614

So far postmortem CT (PMCT) has not been used as a screening instrument for the evaluation of deaths with and without autopsy. In this respect, its validity has to be proved in comparison to clinical-radiological experiences. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Postmortem CT METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: So far, PMCT can be regarded as a methodological innovation that has not yet been sufficiently evaluated for pneumonia. PERFORMANCE: CT in clinical routine has a high sensitivity for pneumonia. However, to what extent postmortem artifacts are relevant to PMCT still has to be determined. ACHIEVEMENTS: There is still no standard procedure for the postmortem radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Despite postmortem artifacts, PMCT can provide valuable information about the presence of pneumonia with interstitial character, especially without autopsy. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: PMCT is particularly useful in the assessment of suspected cases of COVID-19 pneumonia for morphological assessment in the context of monitoring deaths in the current pandemic situation.","Kniep, I; Lutter, M; Ron, A; Edler, C; Püschel, K; Ittrich, H; Heller, M; Heinemann, A",,,614

As a consequence, Italian citizens were confined at home for almost two months, an unprecedented situation, which could have negative effects on both psychological and physical health. The aim of this study was to review the published papers concerning the effects of the lockdown on physical activity and the consequences on general health. As expected, most studies highlighted a significant reduction in the amount of performed physical activity compared to before lockdown, in both the general population and in individuals with chronic conditions. This fact had negative consequences on both general health, in terms of increased body mass, and on specific chronic conditions, especially obesity and neurological diseases.","Zaccagni, Luciana; Toselli, Stefania; Barbieri, Davide",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,614

We also aimed to analyse the effectiveness of an unsupervised home-based exercise routine to counteract the potential increase in sedentary behaviour during the periods within the pandemic. A total of 18 noninstitutionalized older adults(78.4 ± 6.0 y.), members of the Spanish cohort of the EXERNET-Elder 3.0 project, participated in the study. They were recommended to perform an exercise prescription based on resistance, balance, and aerobic exercises during the pandemic. Wrist triaxial accelerometers (ActiGraph GT9X) were used to assess the percentage of sedentary time, physical activity, sedentary bouts and breaks of sedentary time. An ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to analyse the differences between the three different periods. During home quarantine, older adults spent more time in sedentary behaviours (71.6 ± 5.3%) in comparison with either the situation prior to the pandemic (65.5 ± 6.7%) or the ending of isolation (67.7 ± 7.1%) (all p < 0.05). Moreover, participants performed less bouts of physical activity and with a shorter duration during home quarantine (both p < 0.05). Additionally, no differences in the physical activity behaviours were found between the situation prior to the pandemic and the phase-0 of deescalation. According to our results, the home confinement could negatively affect health due to increased sedentary lifestyle and the reduction of physical activity. Therefore, our unsupervised exercise program does not seem to be a completely effective strategy at least in this period.","Fernández-García, Ángel I; Marin-Puyalto, Jorge; Gómez-Cabello, Alba; Matute-Llorente, Ángel; Subías-Perié, Jorge; Pérez-Gómez, Jorge; Lozano-Berges, Gabriel; Mañas, Asier; Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia; González-Gross, Marcela; Ara, Ignacio; Casajús, José A; Vicente-Rodríguez, Germán",Biomed Res Int,,614

MAIN METHODS: To address this issue, a non-critical sized femur defect was created in streptozotocin (STZ)-T1D mice. Control non-diabetic and T1D female and male mice received: saline; vitamin D3; insulin; or vitamin D3 plus insulin, for 21â¯days. KEY FINDINGS: Female and male T1D mice showed impaired bone healing, as indicated by histological and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. Vitamin D3 or insulin improved the bone regeneration in T1D mice, irrespective of sex. Vitamin D3 plus insulin did not exhibit any additional effects. There were no differences regarding the numbers of TRAP-stained osteoclasts in either evaluated groups. The osteoblast-related gene osterix was upregulated in vitamin D3-treated male T1D mice, as revealed by RT-qPCR. Female T1D mice treated with vitamin D3, insulin, or vitamin D3 plus insulin presented an increased expression of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA. Conversely, IGF-1 mRNA levels were reduced by the same treatments in male TD1 mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, the results suggested that T1D similarly delayed the osseous healing in female and male mice, with beneficial effects for either vitamin D3 or insulin in T1D mice of both sexes. However, data indicated marked sex differences regarding the expression of genes implicated in bone formation, in T1D mice treated with vitamin D3 and/or insulin.","Cignachi, Natália P; Ribeiro, Alice; Machado, Gustavo D B; Cignachi, Amanda P; Kist, Luiza W; Bogo, Maurício R; Silva, Rodrigo B M; Campos, Maria M",Life Sci,,614

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of lockdown on type 1 diabetes (T1D) glycemic control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: People with T1D using flash glucose monitoring were included. Data from the 14 days before lockdown were compared with data from the last 14 days after 8 weeks of lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 307 patients were included (age 45.8 ± 12.6 years, 50.2% male, diabetes duration 21.1 ± 12.3 years). Only one patient had COVID-19 infection. Mean glucose decreased from 166.89 ± 29.4 to 158.0 ± 29.0 mg/dL and estimated HbA1c declined from 7.4 ± 1.0 to 7.1 ± 1.0% (54 ± 10.9 vs 57 ± 10.9 mmol/mol; p < 0.001). Time in range increased from 57.8 ± 15.8 to 62.46 ± 16.1%. Time in hyperglycemia > 180 mg/dL and >250 mg/dL decreased from 37.3 ± 1.9% to 32.0 ± 17.1% and from 13.0 ± 11.3 to 10.3 ± 10.6%, respectively; (p < 0.001). Time in hypoglycaemia <70 mg/dL increased from 4.9 ± 4.0% to 5.5 ± 4.4% (p < 0.001). No differences in time <54 mg/dl, coefficient of variation (CV%) or number of scans per day were found. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of lockdown, glycemic control improved in patients with T1D. These results suggest that having more time for self-management may help improve glycemic control in the short term.","Fernández, Elsa; Cortazar, Alicia; Bellido, Virginia",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,614

The rates of burnout are on the rise. Burnout-associated suicide amongst physicians represents a real ""public health crisis."" This article discusses the drivers of burnout and offers some strategies to mitigate burnout and improve well-being. RECENT FINDINGS: Measures of burnout such as stress, micro, and macro-aggression in the workplace have a psychological impact on staff. Additionally, a measurable economic price is exacted when an organization fails to address the lack of well-being burnout represents. SUMMARY: As healthcare providers struggle to survive and deal with the complex new set of problems and obstacles that the COVID-19 pandemic, the National economic crisis, and the increasing regulatory obligations have summoned forth, professional burnout rates have risen drastically. With good leadership, developing comprehensive programs to identify, track, and treat burnout symptoms and improve well-being in the work environment can result in greater work satisfaction and save resources.","Janosy, Norah R; Anderson, Corrie T M",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,,614

Based on analyses of ground-based and satellite observations and experiments with a radiative transfer model, we estimate a 1.3 % (2.3 W m$^{-2}$) increase in surface irradiance with respect to the 2010-2019 mean due to fewer aerosols in the atmosphere, and a 17.6 % (30.7 W m$^{-2}$) increase due to the exceptional dry and cloud-free weather conditions.

In Group 2, the mean number of elective surgeries performed weekly before the start of the pandemic was 26.85 ± 23.52 and after the start of the pandemic, it was 7.65 ± 13.49 (p <0.001). There were significantly higher reported levels of preparedness in Group 1 in terms of: theoretical training of the staff, equipping the staff and adapting the operating theater to safely perform procedures on patients with COVID-19. Overall, 62.23% of responders presume being infected with SARS-CoV-2. C o n c l u s i o n s: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had a significantly negative impact on surgical wards. Despite the preparations, the number of responders who presume being infected with SARS-CoV-2 during present crisis is high.","Stefura, Tomasz; Rymarowicz, Justyna; Wysocki, Michal; Szeliga, Jacek; Wallner, Grzegorz; Pedziwiatr, Michal; Nowakowski, Michal; Major, Piotr",Folia Med Cracov,,614

427681,The educational impact of COVID-19: views from UK GP educators and trainees,2020,"Objectives. To increase testing capability for SARS-CoV-2 during a rapidly evolving public health emergency, we aimed to deploy a validated laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 on an accelerated timeline and using reagent supply chains that were not constrained. Methods. A real-time RT-PCR assay that detects the structural envelope (E) gene of SARS-CoV-2 was developed and validated on the Roche cobas 6800 instrument platform with the omni Utility channel reagents, which performs automated nucleic acid extraction and purification, PCR amplification, and detection. In silico analysis was performed for both inclusivity of all SARS-CoV-2 variants and cross reactivity with other pathogenic organisms. Positive control material was used to determine the Limit of Detection (LOD) and patient samples (positive and negative) confirmed by another authorized assay were used for clinical validation. Experiments were carried out at the Christiana Care Health System’s Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory (Newark, DE) between April 1 and April 4, 2020. Results. A real-time RT-PCR assay for SARS-Cov-2 was developed and validated in just two weeks. For all oligonucleotides, 100% homology to the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences was observed. Greater than 80% homology between one or more oligonucleotides was observed for SARS-Cov (Urbani strain) and Influenza A, however risk of cross reactivity was deemed to be low. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 250 copies/mL. The assay identified 100% of positive patient samples (30/30) and 100% of negative patient samples (29/29 patient negatives and 1/1 saline). Up to 92 samples can be run on a single plate and analysis takes approximately 3.5 hours. Conclusions. In this work, we demonstrate the development and validation of a single target laboratory-developed test for SARS-CoV-2 in two weeks. Key considerations for complementary supply chains enabled development on an accelerated timeline and an increase in testing capability. © 2020, Delaware Academy of Medicine.

Bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are poorly immunogenic, but anti-CPS antibodies are essential to the host defense against encapsulated bacteria. In addition to the previously known serotypes 2 and 14, that are non-immunogenic, we have recently purified and described the CPS structures for serotypes 1, 1/2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. Here, we aimed to elucidate how these new structurally diverse CPSs interact with the immune system to generate anti-CPS antibody responses. CPS-stimulated dendritic cells produced significant levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 3, partially via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2- and myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent pathways, and CCL2, via TLR-independent mechanisms. Mice immunized with purified serotype 3 CPS adjuvanted with TiterMax Gold® produced an opsonizing IgG response, whereas other CPSs or adjuvants were negative. Mice hyperimmunized with heat-killed S. suis serotypes 3 and 9 both produced anti-CPS type 1 IgGs, whereas serotypes 7 and 8 remained negative. Also, mice infected with sublethal doses of S. suis serotype 3 produced primary anti-CPS IgM and IgG responses, of which only IgM were boosted after a secondary infection. In contrast, mice sublethaly infected with S. suis serotype 9 produced weak anti-CPS IgM and IgG responses following a secondary infection. This study provides important information on the divergent evolution of CPS serotypes with highly different structural and/or biochemical properties within S. suis and their interaction with the immune system.","Goyette-Desjardins, Guillaume; Auger, Jean-Philippe; Dolbec, Dominic; Vinogradov, Evgeny; Okura, Masatoshi; Takamatsu, Daisuke; Van Calsteren, Marie-Rose; Gottschalk, Marcelo; Segura, Mariela",Infect. immun,,614

The PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform databases were systematically searched for the following keywords: respiratory tract infection, probiotics, viral infection, COVID-19, and clinical trial. A total of 27 clinical trials conducted on 9433 patients with RTI plus 10 ongoing clinical studies of probiotics intervention in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reviewed. The review looked at the potency of probiotics for the hindrance and/or treatment of RTI diseases, this may also apply to COVID-19. The review found that probiotics could significantly increase the plasma levels of cytokines, the effect of influenza vaccine and quality of life, as well as reducing the titer of viruses and the incidence and duration of respiratory infections. These antiviral and immune-modulating activities and their ability to stimulate interferon production recommend the use of probiotics as an adjunctive therapy to prevent COVID-19. Based on this extensive review of RCTs we suggest that probiotics are a rational complementary treatment for RTI diseases and a viable option to support faster recovery.","Darbandi, Atieh; Asadi, Arezoo; Ghanavati, Roya; Afifirad, Roghayeh; Darb Emamie, Amir; Kakanj, Maryam; Talebi, Malihe",Int J Infect Dis,,614

This study examined the relationships among South Korean emergency workers' precedents and consequences of positive emotion, engagement, relationship, meaning, and achievement (PERMA), a wellbeing concept, and offered solutions. A total of 597 emergency workers in Daegu, South Korea, participated in a survey. This study measured post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome, burnout, depression, PERMA, quality of life, life satisfaction, and sleep quality to test the relationships. Results demonstrated that post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome and burnout predicted distracting sleep behavior and sleep health. Depression was significantly related to PERMA. The better the emergency workers' PERMA was, the better their quality of life and life satisfaction were. PERMA significantly predicted sleep behavior, a portion of sleep quality. Depression had an indirect influence on quality of life mediated by PERMA. Post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome, burnout, and PERMA were significant predictors of low sleep health and sleep behavior. The results indicate that South Korean emergency workers struggle with depression and sleep quality. As the data were collected during the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic, individual efforts and relevant programs to improve South Korean emergency workers' PERMA and sleep quality in a crisis are recommended.

To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through congregate settings, universal testing may be necessary. We aimed to determine the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a residential treatment program setting and to understand the unique challenges of Covid-19 transmission in this setting. METHODS: We performed a case series of SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR testing via nasopharyngeal in a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Staff and residents of the treatment program were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 test result. RESULTS: A total of 31 residents and staff were tested. Twenty-seven percent (6/22) of the residents and 44% (4/9) of staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents resided in the same residential unit. Two positive cases resided together with 2 negative cases in a 4-person room. Two other positive cases resided together in a 2-person room. One positive case resided with 2 negative cases in a 3-person room. One positive case resided with a negative case in a 2-person room. Based on test results, residents were cohorted by infection status and continued to participate in addiction treatment on-site. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was common among staff and residents within a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in residential substance use programs can be instituted to reduce the risk of further transmission and continue addiction treatment programming when accompanied by adequate space, supplies, and staffing.","Barocas, Joshua A; Blackstone, Elizabeth; Bouton, Tara C; Kimmel, Simeon D; Caputo, Andrea; Porter, Sarah J; Walley, Alexander Y",J Addict Med,,614
433321,"COVID-19 infection: comparing the knowledge, attitude and practices in a sample of nursing students",2020,"Health Psychology has received numerous papers over the past several months on topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of them concern depression, anxiety, stress, or other forms of distress in the general population or in health care workers. We have received far fewer papers on COVID-related health behaviors and health communications-factors that have played central roles in the spread of the pandemic and that are major topics in health psychology. Our experience is consistent with the published scientific literature on the pandemic. A Medline search that we conducted in late September yielded over 23,000 English-language articles pertaining to COVID-19. Over 1,400 of them concerned topics that are within the scope of Health Psychology. As shown in Table 1, COVID-related mental disorders comprised the largest category. Many other studies concerned other forms of stress or emotional distress. At least 248 articles addressed the profound ethnic and racial disparities in COVID-19 infection and death rates and in access to health care that are accentuating longstanding health inequities; 22 (9%) of these articles addressed behavioral or psychosocial aspects of COVID-19 health disparities.

433916,Assessment of psychometric characteristics of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale in patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Greece is a country with limited spread of SARS-CoV-2 and cumulative infection attack rate of 0.12% (95% CI 0.06-0.26). Health care workers (HCWs) are a well-recognized risk group for COVID-19. The study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a nosocomial setting and assess potential risk factors. METHODS: HCWs from two hospitals participated in the study. Hospital-1 was a tertiary university affiliated center, involved in the care of COVID-19 patients while hospital-2 was a tertiary specialized cardiac surgery center not involved in the care of these patients. A validated, CE, rapid, IgM/IgG antibody point-of-care test was used. Comparative performance with a reference globally available assay was assessed. RESULTS: 1,495 individuals consented to participate (response rate 77%). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 weighted prevalence was 1.26% (95% CI 0.43, 3.26) overall and 0.53% (95% CI 0.06, 2.78) and 2.70% (95% CI 0.57, 9.19) in hospital-1 and hospital-2, respectively although the study was underpowered to detect statistically significant differences. The overall, hospital-1, and hospital-2 seroprevalence was 10, 4 and 22 times higher than the estimated infection attack rate in general population, respectively. Suboptimal use of personal protective equipment was noted in both hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: These data have implications for the preparedness of a second wave of COVID-19 epidemic, given the low burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, in concordance with national projections.","Psichogiou, Mina; Karabinis, Andreas; Pavlopoulou, Ioanna D; Basoulis, Dimitrios; Petsios, Konstantinos; Roussos, Sotirios; Pratikaki, Maria; Jahaj, Edison; Protopapas, Konstantinos; Leontis, Konstantinos; Rapti, Vasiliki; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Poulakou, Garyphallia; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Sypsa, Vana; Hatzakis, Angelos",PLoS One,,614
434426,Addressing psychosocial problems associated with the COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"Two conundrums puzzle COVID-19 investigators: 1) morbidity and mortality is rare among infants and young children and 2) rates of morbidity and mortality exhibit large variances across nations, locales, and even within cities. It is found that the higher the rate of pneumococcal vaccination in a nation (or city) the lower the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Vaccination rates with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, poliovirus, and other vaccines do not correlate with COVID-19 risks, nor do COVID-19 case or death rates correlate with number of people in the population with diabetes, obesity, or adults over 65. Infant protection may be due to maternal antibodies and antiviral proteins in milk such as lactoferrin that are known to protect against coronavirus infections. Subsequent protection might then be conferred (and correlate with) rates of Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) (universal in infants) and pneumococcal vaccination, the latter varying widely by geography among infants, at-risk adults, and the elderly.

Background: Molecular studies, especially proteomics, can be considered as suitable approaches for discovering the hidden aspect of the disease. Methods: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of three patients with demonstrated severe condition (S-COVID-19) were compared to healthy cases by a proteomics study. Cytoscape software and STRING database were used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The central DEPs were identified through topological analysis of the network. ClueGO+CluePedia were applied to find the biological processes related to the central nodes. MCODE molecular complex detection (MCODE) was used to discover protein complexes. Results: A total of 242 DEPs from among 256 query ones were included in the network. Centrality analysis of the network assigned 16 hub-bottlenecks, nine of which were presented in the highest-scored protein complex. Ten protein complexes were determined. APOA1 was identified as the protein complex seed, and APP, EGF, and C3 were the top hub-bottlenecks of the network. The results specify that up-regulation of C3 and down-regulation of APOA1 in urine play a role in the stiffness in respiration and, accordingly, the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, dysregulation of APP and APOA1 could both contribute to the possible adverse effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system. Conclusion: The introduced central proteins of the S-COVID-19 interaction network, particularly APOA1, can be considered as diagnostic and therapeutic targets related to the coronavirus disease after being approved with complementary studies.","Zamanian Azodi, Mona; Arjmand, Babak; Zali, Alireza; Razzaghi, Mohammadreza",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,,614

COVID 19, started in December 2019 in China, has been considered a public health emergency by the Department of Health and Human Services and, at the moment, it is a pandemic disease with worldwide diffusion. The Covid 19 crisis permits to increase the role of Telemedicine as a tool for the delivery of health care services at distance and to slow down the virus diffusion. This technology is cheap and easy to use but it is limited by governmental licensing restrictions, reimbursement barriers, lesser extent of infrastructure and difficulties related to the change. During COVID 19 Epidemy, Telemedicine is safe, low cost and permits to treat urgent and routine specialist cases without human proximity and contact which would spread infection, particularly to the elderly and immunocompromised patients. In COVID 19 era, the goal of PCP is to reduce travels and visits in specialized center for liver disease patients. A strict collaboration between specialized hepatologist and PCP is needed.","Casella, Giovanni; Ingravalle, Fabio; Ingravalle, Adriana; Monti, Claudio; Bonetti, Fulvio; Limonta, Aurelio",,,614

The second wave of cases in Europe, in regions that were considered as COVID-19 controlled, may raise some concerns. Our objective was to assess the association between staying at home (%) and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions in the world. In this ecological study, data from www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ , ourworldindata.org and covid.saude.gov.br were combined. Countries with > 100 deaths and with a Healthcare Access and Quality Index of &#8805; 67 were included. Data were preprocessed and analyzed using the difference between number of deaths/million between 2 regions and the difference between the percentage of staying at home. The analysis was performed using linear regression with special attention to residual analysis. After preprocessing the data, 87 regions around the world were included, yielding 3741 pairwise comparisons for linear regression analysis. Only 63 (1.6%) comparisons were significant. With our results, we were not able to explain if COVID-19 mortality is reduced by staying at home in ~ 98% of the comparisons after epidemiological weeks 9 to 34.","Savaris, R F; Pumi, G; Dalzochio, J; Kunst, R",Sci Rep,,614

As no specific therapeutics are yet available to control disease evolution, more in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 will help to characterize new targets for the management of COVID-19. The present study identified a specific set of biological pathways altered in primary human lung epithelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a comparison with SARS-CoV from the 2003 pandemic was studied. The transcriptomic profiles were also exploited as possible novel therapeutic targets, and anti-signature perturbation analysis predicted potential drugs to control disease progression. Among them, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B Kinase (IKK) inhibitors emerged as candidate drugs. Finally, sex-specific differences that may underlie the higher COVID-19 mortality in men are proposed.","Fagone, Paolo; Ciurleo, Rosella; Lombardo, Salvo Danilo; Iacobello, Carmelo; Palermo, Concetta Ilenia; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Bendtzen, Klaus; Bramanti, Placido; Nicoletti, Ferdinando",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01042v1.pdf,614

436023,COVID-19 Pandemic and its Impact on Craniofacial Surgery,2020,"In late December 2019, a series of acute atypical respiratory disease occurred in Wuhan, China, which rapidly spread to other areas worldwide. It was soon discovered that a novel coronavirus was responsible, named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV). The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population’s health is unprecedented in recent years and the impact on a social level even more so. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most large-scale pandemic on earth this century, and the impact in all life sectors is devasting and directly affected human activity in the first wave. The impact on the economy, social care systems, and human relationships is causing an unprecedented global crisis. SARS-CoV-2 has a strong direct acute impact on population health, not only at the physiological level but also at the psychological level for those who suffer it, those close to them, and the general population, who suffer from the social consequences of the pandemic. In this line, the economic recession increased, even more, the social imbalance and inequity, hitting the most vulnerable families, and creating a difficult context for public institutions to address. We are facing one of the greatest challenges of social intervention, which requires fast, effective, and well-coordinated responses from public institutions, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations to serve an increasingly hopeless population with increasingly urgent needs. Long-term legislation is necessary to reduce the vulnerability of the less fortunate, as well as to analyze the societal response to improve the social organization management of available resources. Therefore, in this scoping review, a consensus and critical review were performed using both primary sources, such as scientific articles, and secondary ones, such as bibliographic indexes, web pages, and databases. The main search engines were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature. The aim was to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health, where the possible interventions at the health level are discussed, the impact in economic and social areas, and the government and health systems interventions in the pandemic, and finally, possible economic models for the recovery of the crisis are proposed.","Clemente-Suárez, Vicente Javier Navarro-Jiménez Eduardo Moreno-Luna Libertad Saavedra-Serrano María Concepción Jimenez Manuel Simón Juan Antonio Tornero-Aguilera Jose Francisco",Sustainability,,614

Viral replication is shaped by the cellular microenvironment, and one important factor to consider is oxygen tension, in which hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) regulates transcriptional responses to hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract, entering via its spike glycoprotein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We demonstrate that hypoxia and the HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor Roxadustat reduce ACE2 expression and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in lung epithelial cells via an HIF-1&#945;-dependent pathway. Hypoxia and Roxadustat inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are oxygen sensitive. This study highlights the importance of HIF signaling in regulating multiple aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and raises the potential use of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.","Wing, Peter A C; Keeley, Thomas P; Zhuang, Xiaodong; Lee, Jeffrey Y; Prange-Barczynska, Maria; Tsukuda, Senko; Morgan, Sophie B; Harding, Adam C; Argles, Isobel L A; Kurlekar, Samvid; Noerenberg, Marko; Thompson, Craig P; Huang, Kuan-Ying A; Balfe, Peter; Watashi, Koichi; Castello, Alfredo; Hinks, Timothy S C; James, William; Ratcliffe, Peter J; Davis, Ilan; Hodson, Emma J; Bishop, Tammie; McKeating, Jane A",Cell Rep,,614

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Beck anxiety inventory and a clinical activities scale were utilized as data collection tools and distributed to neurosurgeons in Turkey as an online survey. Descriptive statistical methods, significance tests and correlation and regression analyses were employed to analyze the data. The data analysis was carried out in a 95% confidence interval Results: Of the 240 neurosurgeons who participated in the study, 63.8% had encountered cases of COVID-19 and 53.8% had handled patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study results showed that the pandemic did not cause anxiety in 62.9% of the respondents, but it caused mild anxiety in 13.8% and moderate anxiety in 12.12%. The findings also revealed a low linear correlation between the anxiety values and occupational anxiety of the neurosurgeons and low inverse correlation between anxiety values and the protection factor in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious disruptions in the routine functioning of neurosurgery clinics and changes in the attitudes of neurosurgeons.

437882,The Significance of Antiseptic Techniques During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Joseph Lister's Historical Contribution to Surgery,2020,"BACKGROUND: Web-based counseling and support has become increasingly commonplace for children and young people (CYP). Currently, there is limited research that focuses on the mechanisms of change within complex telepsychology platforms, a factor that makes designing and implementing outcome measures challenging. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to articulate a theory of change (ToC) for Kooth, a web-based therapy and support platform for CYP. METHODS: A collaborative qualitative research design involving professional staff, academic partners, and young people was used to develop the ToC. The following three major reflective phases were engaged: a scoping workshop involving professional staff and academic partners, a series of explorative projects were completed to inform the development of the ToC, and the draft ToC was reviewed for coherence by key stakeholders (young people, online professionals, and service managers). RESULTS: A collaboratively developed ToC was presented. This was divided into the conditions that lead to individuals wanting to access web-based therapy and support (eg, individuals wanting support there and then or quickly), the mode of service delivery (eg, skilled and experienced professionals able to build empathetic relationships with CYP), and the observed and reported changes that occur as a consequence of using the service (eg, individuals being better able to manage current and future situations). CONCLUSIONS: Developing the ToC helps to shed light on how web-based therapy and support services aid the mental health and well-being of CYP. Furthermore, it helps to understand the development of positive virtual ecosystems and can be used to devise evaluative tools for CYP telepsychology providers.","Hanley, Terry; Sefi, Aaron; Grauberg, Janet; Prescott, Julie; Etchebarne, Andre",JMIR Pediatr Parent,,614

The 5-year local, and regional, distant control rates, disease-free, overall, and cancer-specific survival, and late toxicity were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 1316 OSCC patients treated with curative-intent; 108 patients (8%) received non-operative management due to: medical inoperability (n = 14, 13%), surgical unresectability (n = 8, 7%), patient declined surgery (n = 15, 14%), attempted preservation of oral structure/function in view of required extensive surgery (n = 53, 49%) or extensive oropharyngeal involvement (n = 18, 17%). Sixty-eight (63%) were cT3-4, 38 (35%) were cN2-3, and 38 (35%) received concurrent chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 52 months, the 5-year local, regional, distant control rate, disease-free, overall, and cancer-specific survival were 78%, 92%, 90%, 42%, 50%, and 76% respectively. Patients with cN2-3 had higher rate of 5-year distant metastasis (24% vs 3%, p = 0.001), with detrimental impact on DFS (p = 0.03) and OS (p < 0.02) on multivariable analysis. Grade &#8805; 3 late toxicity was reported in 9% of patients (most common: grade 3 osteoradionecrosis in 6%). CONCLUSIONS: Non-operative management of OSCC resulted in a meaningful rate of locoregional control, and could be an alternative curative approach when primary surgery would be declined, unsuitable or unacceptably delayed.","Hosni, Ali; Chiu, Kevin; Huang, Shao Hui; Xu, Wei; Huang, Jingyue; Bayley, Andrew; Bratman, Scott V; Cho, John; Giuliani, Meredith; Kim, John; O039,; Sullivan, Brian; Ringash, Jolie; Waldron, John; Spreafico, Anna; de Almeida, John R; Monteiro, Eric; Witterick, Ian; Chepeha, Douglas B; Gilbert, R W; Irish, Jonathan C; Goldstein, David P; Hope, Andrew",Radiother Oncol,,614

We propose a novel framework called Testing-for-Effect-Modifier (TEEM) for this purpose that facilitates data-driven decision making by testing hypotheses about complex effect modifiers in terms of network features or network patterns (e.g., characteristics of neighbors of a unit or belonging to a triangle), and by identifying sub-populations for which a treatment is likely to be effective or harmful. We describe a hypothesis testing approach that accounts for unit's covariates, their neighbors' covariates and patterns in the social network, and devise an algorithm incorporating ideas from causal inference, hypothesis testing, and graph theory to verify a hypothesized effect modifier. We perform extensive experimental evaluations with a real development economics dataset about the treatment effect of belonging to a financial support network called self-help groups on risk tolerance, and also with a synthetic dataset with known ground truths simulating a vaccine efficacy trial, to evaluate our framework and algorithms.","Gilad, Amir; Parikh, Harsh; Roy, Sudeepa; Salimi, Babak",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10591v3.pdf,614
440213,Functional gastrointestinal diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic: The view of an outpatient gastroenterologist,2021,"BACKGROUND: Early reports suggested increased mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer but lacked rigorous comparisons to patients without cancer. We investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with a history of cancer admitted to two large hospitals between March 13, 2020, and May 10, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and matched them 1:2 to patients without a history of cancer. RESULTS: Men made up 56.2% of the population, with a median age of 69 years (range, 30-96). The median time since cancer diagnosis was 35.6 months (range, 0.39-435); 80% had a solid tumor, and 20% had a hematologic malignancy. Among patients with cancer, 27.8% died or entered hospice versus 25.6% among patients without cancer. In multivariable analyses, the odds of death/hospice were similar (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.82). The odds of intubation (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.78), shock (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91), and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81) were lower for patients with a history of cancer versus controls. Patients with active cancer or who had received cancer-directed therapy in the past 6 months had similar odds of death/hospice compared with cancer survivors (univariable OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.66-2.60; multivariable OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.69-3.16). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 had similar mortality to matched hospitalized patients with COVID-19 without cancer, and a lower risk of complications. In this population, patients with active cancer or recent cancer treatment had a similar risk for adverse outcomes compared with survivors of cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death or hospice admission in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Active cancer, systemic cancer therapy, and a cancer history are not independent risk factors for death from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, and hospitalized patients without cancer are more likely to have severe COVID-19. These findings provide reassurance to survivors of cancer and patients with cancer as to their relative risk of severe COVID-19, may encourage oncologists to provide standard anticancer therapy in patients at risk of COVID-19, and guide triage in future waves of infection.","Klein, Isaac A; Rosenberg, Shoshana M; Reynolds, Kerry L; Zubiri, Leyre; Rosovsky, Rachel; Piper-Vallillo, Andrew J; Gao, Xin; Boland, Genevieve; Bardia, Aditya; Gaither, Rachel; Freeman, Hannah; Kirkner, Gregory J; Rhee, Chanu; Klompas, Michael; Baker, Meghan A; Wadleigh, Martha; Winer, Eric P; Kotton, Camille N; Partridge, Ann H",Oncologist,,614

Therefore, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of antiplatelet treatments on patients with COVID-19 infection. An electronic search was carried out in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Meta-analysis and statistical analyses were completed with using the RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0. A total of 9 articles representing data from 5970 participants were included in this study. The meta-analysis showed antiplatelet agents were not associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.64 to 1.50, P = 0.94; I 2 = 65%), while an adjusted analysis indicated that antiplatelet agents was not associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.40 to 1.06, P = 0.498; I 2 = 0%). The results of this study reveal that while there is no significant benefit on mortality demonstrated with the use of antiplatelet agents, the upper bound of the confidence interval suggests that there is unlikely to be a compelling risk of harm associated with this practice. The benefit and risk of the use of antiplatelet agents should be fully considered especially in the presence of thrombocytopenia status in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Yushu; Ao, Guangyu; Nasr, Basma; Qi, Xin",Am J Emerg Med,,614

The UHT milk is a milk product that has undergone a process of heat treatment in which the milk is heated to a temperature of 137 0 C, and kept at that temperature for 4 seconds before being cooled to room temperature. UHT milk retains almost all the ben-eficial properties of the original product, while it belongs to long-term storage goods and does not require the use of refrigeration equipment. The importance of the product has sharply in-creased during the quarantine imposed by the authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, there is a significant number of UHT milk brands on the consumer market, which leads to quite serious competition and necessitates studying the level of their competitiveness, especially for solving applied issues in the local geographic segment of the market. According to the author, today there is definitely a lack of comprehensive scientific methodological approaches to assessing the competitiveness and quality of UHT milk sold on the local market. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to assess the competitiveness and quality of UHT milk of various brands, presented on the market of Troitsk, Chelyabinsk region. The study assumes a complex methodology, which includes the following stages: 1) identification of the competitiveness of UHT milk by the index method of the ratio of prices and quality of the milk samples under study;2) conducting a comprehensive assessment of the competitiveness of UHT milk brands presented in the local market, based on the primary marketing research of consumer preferences in this segment of the dairy market;3) identification of the level of competitiveness of milk trade marks on the basis of the economic method, which assumes their ranking by trade volume.

The model is a modification to a recent continuous-time SITR model by taking into account the possibility that people who have been infected before can lose their temporary immunity and get reinfected. Moreover, a modification is suggested in the present model to correct the improper assumption that the infection rates of both normal susceptible and old aged/seriously diseased people are equal. This modification complies with experimental data. The equilibrium points for the proposed model are found and results of thorough stability analysis are discussed. A full numerical simulation is carried out and gives a better analysis of the disease spread, influences of model’s parameters, and how to control the virus.

As of February 29, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has reported 79,389 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 34 provinces. The masks can be used to block respiratory transmission from human to human, and are an effective way to control influenza. It is, therefore, necessary to wear a mask when respiratory infectious diseases are prevalent. China has a population of 1.4 billion. Assuming that two-thirds of the people in China must wear a mask every day, the daily demand for masks will reach 900 million. The Chinese government has taken many measures to solve these problems. Additionally, more measures should be taken to properly dispose of mask garbage. Although the outbreak originated in China, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed, which means that it can be spread to anywhere in the world if prevention measures fail. The issues regarding face mask shortages and garbage in China, therefore, deserve worldwide attention.","Wang, M-W; Zhou, M-Y; Ji, G-H; Ye, L; Cheng, Y-R; Feng, Z-H; Chen, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,614

Acidic electrolyzed water (EW) with a high concentration of free available chlorine (FAC) shows strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Here, we assessed the SARS-CoV-2-inactivating efficacy of acidic EW for use as an alternative disinfectant. The quick virucidal effect of acidic EW depended on the concentrations of contained-FAC. The effect completely disappeared in acidic EW in which FAC was lost owing to long-time storage after generation. In addition, the virucidal activity increased proportionately with the volume of acidic EW mixed with the virus solution when the FAC concentration in EW was same. These findings suggest that the virucidal activity of acidic EW against SARS-CoV-2 depends on the amount of FAC contacting the virus.","Takeda, Yohei; Uchiumi, Hiroshi; Matsuda, Sachiko; Ogawa, Haruko",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,614

Thus, this study was planned to compare and evaluate seven commercially available kits for pooled samples testing. METHODS: Diagnostic accuracy of (1) TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit (Black Bio, India) (2) TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) (3) Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay (See gene, Korea), (4) Patho detect COVID-19 PCR kit (My Lab, India) (5) LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit (Lab Genomics, Korea) (6) Fosun COVID-19 RT-PCR detection kit (Fosun Ltd, China) (7) Real time Fluorescent RT PCR kit for SARS CoV - 2 (BGI, china) was evaluated on pre characterised 40 positive and 10 negative COVID-19 sample pools. RESULTS: All seven kits detected all sample pool with low Ct value (<30). While testing weak positive pooled samples with high Ct value (>30); TRUPCR Kit, TaqPath Kit, Allplex Assay and BGI RT PCR kit showed 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. However; Fosun kit, LabGun Kit and Patho detect kit could detect only 90%, 85% and 75% of weak positive samples respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that all seven commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. While performing pooled sample testing it might be advisable to use those kits that performed best regarding the positive identification in samples pool i.e. TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit, TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit, Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay and BGI Real time RT PCR kit for detecting SARS CoV - 2.

The authors argue in particular that Board 2 0, as embedded in both current practice and regulation, now fails the functional fit test for many companies First, it does not scale to match the dramatic increase in the size and complexity of many modern public corporations Second, at a time of reconcentrated ownership achieved through institutional investors and increased activism, it does not have the expertise and commitment needed to resolve the tension between managerial or market myopia, or ?short-termism,? and managerial ?hyperopia ?

444166,Increased addictive Internet and substance use behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in China,2020,"The prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 varies greatly between populations. It is unclear whether such differences are due to factors at the level of the human host, or at the level of the coronavirus, or both. At the host level, the entry proteins which allow virus binding and entry have variants with distinct properties, and the frequency of such variants differs between ethnicities. At the level of the virus, the D614G mutation enhances virus entry to the host cell. Since the two virus strains (D614 and G614) co-existed in the first six months of the pandemic in most populations, it has been difficult to distinguish between contributions of the virus and contributions of the host for anosmia. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in South Asian populations when either the D614 or the G614 virus was dominant. We show that populations infected predominantly with the G614 virus had a much higher prevalence of anosmia (pooled prevalence of 31.8%) compared with the same ethnic populations infected mostly with the D614 virus strain (pooled anosmia prevalence of 5.3%). We conclude that the D614G mutation is a major contributing factor that increases the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19, and that this enhanced effect on olfaction constitutes a previously unrecognized phenotype of the D614G mutation. The new virus strains that have additional mutations on the background of the D614G mutation can be expected to cause a similarly increased prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions.

On April 28, 2020, a total of 945 studies on COVID-19 have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov; 586 studies are interventional (62.0%), the most frequent allocation scheme is the parallel group assignment (437; 74.6%), they are open-label and the most common primary purpose is the research on treatment. Too many of the ongoing interventional studies have a small expected sample size and may not generate credible evidence at completion. This might lead to a delayed recognition of effective therapies that are urgently needed, and a waste of time and resources.

As part of the COVID-19 situation, many proposals have been made for scaling up contract tracing capacities with the help of smartphone applications, an important but highly critical endeavor due to the privacy risks involved in such solutions. Extending our previously expressed concern, we clearly articulate in this article, the functional and non-functional requirements that any solution has to meet, when striving to serve, not mere collections of individuals, but the whole of a nation, as required in face of such potentially dangerous epidemics. We present a critical information infrastructure, PriLock, a fully-open preliminary architecture proposal and design draft for privacy preserving contact tracing, which we believe can be constructed in a way to fulfill the former requirements. Our architecture leverages the existing regulated mobile communication infrastructure and builds upon the concept of""checks and balances"", requiring a majority of independent players to agree to effect any operation on it, thus preventing abuse of the highly sensitive information that must be collected and processed for efficient contact tracing. This is enforced with a largely decentralised layout and highly resilient state-of-the-art technology, which we explain in the paper, finishing by giving a security, dependability and resilience analysis, showing how it meets the defined requirements, even while the infrastructure is under attack.","Esteves-Verissimo, Paulo; Decouchant, J'er'emie; Volp, Marcus; Esfahani, Alireza; Graczyk, Rafal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04519v2.pdf,614
445988,Dementia wellbeing and COVID-19: Review and expert consensus on current research and knowledge gaps,2021,"Background: The experiences of SARS-CoV-2 are different in nature among the different states of the world. Studies on survival analysis of such pandemic mainly based on differential equation analysis, but the main limitation of such models is non-universal applicability. Consideration of improper functional relation in case of identification, survival and testing effort variables of the disease may be the cause of such non-universal applicability. Methods: Present study using optimization techniques try to find the general functional form for the variables like identification of the carrier's and testing effort. The study uses both the discrete and continuous time procedure of optimization technique. The main objective of the study is to institute relation between the identified carrier's and effort taken for identification. Results: The study considers test as the pseudo variable for effort of identification. The study found that the relationship between test and identified is not a linear one, rather it is nonlinear quadratic type. The study does not go for using data driven methods to verify the results.","Bhattacharya, Subhasis; Paul, Suman",Results Phys,,614

The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is much higher in DS than in the general population, possibly increasing further the risk of COVID-19 infection and its complications. Here we provide a biological overview with regard to specific susceptibility of individuals with DS to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as data from a recent survey on the prevalence of COVID-19 among them. We see an urgent need to protect people with DS, especially those with AD, from COVID-19 and future pandemics and focus on developing protective measures, which also include interventions by health systems worldwide for reducing the negative social effects of long-term isolation and increased periods of hospitalization.","Illouz, Tomer; Biragyn, Arya; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana; Weissberg, Orly; Gorohovski, Alessandro; Merzon, Eugene; Green, Ilan; Iulita, Florencia; Flores-Aguilar, Lisi; Dierssen, Mara; De Toma, Ilario; Lifshitz, Hefziba; Antonarakis, Stylianos E; Yu, Eugene; Herault, Yann; Potier, Marie-Claude; Botté, Alexandra; Roper, Randall; Sredni, Benjamin; Sarid, Ronit; London, Jacqueline; Mobley, William; Strydom, Andre; Okun, Eitan",Neuromol. med.

447238,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a visceral surgical department in western Austria,2020,"This paper assesses the Granger causality between government spending and gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States at multiple horizons. This paper also analyses the role the real exchange rate plays in the causality measure during the zero lower bound (ZLB) period. Many researchers using theoretical models built in a closed economy suggest that the elasticity between government spending and GDP is very large, when the nominal interest rate is binding. Other researchers, also using theoretical models generally built in an open economy, suggest that the elasticity in the ZLB period is not large. The same conflicting results are reported in the empirical literature mostly using vector auto regressives (VARs), with different restrictions. In this paper, we use a different approach to measure the link between the two variables. The new approach has the advantage of not relying on any restrictions, as is the case with VARs when dealing with causalities. Moreover, our approach is not related to the way the model is built, as is the case with dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) types of models. In this paper, we use a Granger causality measure to compare the causality for normal periods with the causality for the ZLB period. We emphasize the role played by the real exchange rate. Our empirical results provide evidence that the causality measures between government spending and GDP are larger and persistent in the ZLB period, but only if the exchange rate is not taken into account. When the exchange rate is taken into account, our measure of causality becomes very small and non-persistent.","Mao Takongmo, Charles Olivier; Lebihan, Laetitia",J Quant Econ,,614

METHODS: Direct and indirect risks were defined as (a) vertical infection (congenital or intrapartum), (b) maternal infection and its sequelae, and (c) sources of maternal stress during lockdown, including social isolation and altered healthcare provision. RESULTS: Early studies suggest that vertical viral transmission is low; however, there may be an important effect of maternal infection on foetal growth and development. The impact of various degrees of lockdown on prospective mothers' health, habits and healthcare provision is of concern. In particular, increased maternal stress has been shown to have a significant effect on foetal brain development increasing the risk of mental health, and cognitive and behavioural disorders in later life. CONCLUSION: From the evidence available to date, direct risks to the foetus from the SARS-CoV-2 virus are low. Indirect effects of the pandemic, particularly resulting from the effect of maternal stress on the developing brain, can have lifelong detrimental impacts for this generation of children.","Iqbal, Aysha; Burrin, Charlotte; Aydin, Ezra; Beardsall, Kathryn; Wong, Hilary; Austin, Topun",Acta paediatr. scand,,614
447972,Preferential use of total intravenous anesthesia in ambulatory otolaryngology surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 as a primary receptor for invasion. This study investigated angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 expression in the sinonasal mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, as this could be linked to a susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. METHODS: Ethmoid sinus specimens were obtained from 27 patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, 18 with non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis and 18 controls. The angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 and other inflammatory cytokine and chemokine messenger RNA levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 positive cells were examined immunohistologically. RESULTS: The eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis patients showed a significant decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 messenger RNA expression. In the chronic rhinosinusitis patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 messenger RNA levels were positively correlated with tumour necrosis factor-&#945; and interleukin-1ß (r = 0.4971 and r = 0.3082, respectively), and negatively correlated with eotaxin-3 (r = -0.2938). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 immunoreactivity was mainly localised in the ciliated epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis patients with type 2 inflammation showed decreased angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 expression in their sinus mucosa. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 regulation was positively related to pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially tumour necrosis factor-&#945; production, in chronic rhinosinusitis patients.","Kawasumi, T; Takeno, S; Nishimura, M; Ishino, T; Ueda, T; Hamamoto, T; Takemoto, K; Horibe, Y",J Laryngol Otol,,614

Herein, we report a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) platform that can achieve this sensitivity and rapidity without bulky lab-bound equipment. The key technology is a flattened pipette tip with an elliptical cross-section, which extends a high aspect-ratio microfluidic chip design to pipette scale, for rapid (<5 min) generation of several thousand monodispersed droplets â¼150 to 350 µm in size with a CV of â¼2.3%. A block copolymer surfactant (polyoxyalkylene F127) is used to stabilize these large droplets in oil during thermal cycling. At this droplet size and number, positive droplets can be counted by eye or imaged by a smartphone with appropriate illumination/filtering to accurately quantify up to 100 target copies. We demonstrate with 2019 nCoV-PCR assay LODs of 3.8 copies per 20 µL of sample and a dynamic range of 4-100 copies. The ddPCR platform is shown to be inhibitor resistant with spiked saliva samples, suggesting RNA extraction may not be necessary. It represents a rapid 1.5-h POC quantitative PCR test that requires just a pipette equipped with elliptical pipette tip, a commercial portable thermal cycler, a smartphone, and a portable trans-illuminator, without bulky and expensive micropumps and optical detectors that prevent POC application.","Chen, Liao; Yadav, Vivek; Zhang, Chenguang; Huo, Xiaoye; Wang, Ceming; Senapati, Satyajyoti; Chang, Hsueh-Chia",Anal Chem,,614
448418,Assessment of Patient Experiences in Otolaryngology Virtual Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Compartmental models simplify the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases based on reported cases. In the absence of precautions, personal protective equipment, quarantine and social distancing, a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SuEIR) model with Unscented Kalman Filter for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) Forecasts in Turkey has revealed 174 641 infected people on August 15, 2020, whilst the reported case was 12 216. Through numerical experiments, the effects of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak varies. We herein present the documentation of the work in a perinatology clinic during COVID-19 pandemic to find the reflection in a pandemic hospital as even in the pandemic, pregnancy complications and fetal diagnosis/therapy are time-sensitive and cannot be delayed. During the prevention of the horizontal transmission to the health-care workers (HCWs), testing all pregnant women with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) undergoing birth, ultrasound examinations, invasive procedures appear to be the gold standard so that appropriate precautions can be taken if the screen is positive. Though it is logical, it may be incompatible with a busy obstetric practise as a pending polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result should never delay any emergent procedure. OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the development of COVID-19 disease of 408 HCW out of 1462 by the exposure to pregnant women while providing obstetric care in a single tertiary perinatology unit under strict clinical triage, recommended precautions and wearing personal protective equipment and compare the maternal and perinatal outcome with those of the preceding three months. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study involving the pregnant women and the HCW with positive PCR for SARS-COV-2 were carried out to correlate with the horizontal transmission while documenting the perinatal work. RESULTS: 25 HCW, including nurses/midwives: 11, doctors: 7 and health technicians: 3 and support staff: 4 developed positive PCR for SARS-COV-2 while providing healthcare to 162 cases: mild-moderate (n = 146), severe (n = 12) and critical (n = 1) and asymptomatic (n = 3) in obstetric population. 22 out of 25 HCW were working in the perinatology unit. COVID-19 clinic was asymptomatic (n = 8), mild-moderate (13) or severe (n = 2) in HCW. However, ""Exposed"" group in the SuEIR model, both the pregnant women and the HCW that have already been infected and have not been tested, which have been also capable of infecting the ""Susceptible"" group could not be determined. Some of the HCW and the pregnant women in the ""Exposed"" group were tested and transferred to the ""Infectious"" group (which were reported to be PCR positive), while the rest of them who recovered, transitted to the so-called ""Unreported Recovered"" group. The ratio of the women with severe pre-eclampsia admitted to intensive care unit increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: In a nonstop pandemic perinatology clinic, exposure to 162 PCR positive pregnant women may be correlated with a 5.4% (22/408) documented horizontal transmission in the frontline HCW despite clinical triage and personal protective equipment.","Yapar Eyi, Elif Gul; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem; Buglagil, Arda; Sahin, Dilek; Yucel, Aykan; Tanacan, Atakan; Halici Ozturk, Filiz; Yakistiran, Betul; Yucel Yetiskin, Didem; Unlu, Serpil; Gokcinar, Derya",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,614

This paper presents Facebook's risk-driven backbone management strategy to ensure high service performance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe Risk Simulation System (RSS), a production system that identifies possible failures and quantifies their potential severity with a set of metrics for network risk. With a year-long risk measurement from RSS we show that our backbone resiliently withstood the COVID-19 stress test, achieving high service availability and low route dilation while efficiently handling traffic surges. We also share our operational practices to mitigate risk throughout the pandemic. Our findings give insights to further improve risk-driven network management. We argue for incorporating short-term failure statistics in modeling failures. Common failure prediction models based on long-term modeling achieve stable output at the cost of assigning low significance to unique short-term events of extreme importance such as COVID-19. Furthermore, we advocate augmenting network management techniques with non-networking signals. We support this by identifying and analyzing the correlation between network traffic and human mobility.","Xia, Y. T.; Zhang, Y.; Zhong, Z. Z.; Yan, G. Q.; Lim, C. L.; Ahuja, S.

We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.24±3.59) and attitudes (3.72±2.31) and good practices (12.12±1.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p&#8804;0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores.

450808,Correction to: The PanSurg-PREDICT Study: Endocrine Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: External radiotherapy process is a chain of steps in which each of them is carried out only if the previous one has been completed. The development of hypofractionation practices in recent years tends to increase the workload of the stages of preparation for irradiation and to decrease the number of fractions per patient. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze the evolution of these practices in a single centre and to assess the organizational issues involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All radiation therapy records management data were extracted from the Radiation Therapy Information System. Radiotherapy sessions were identified by patient and by ICD (International Classification of Diseases) code. The filling rate of the treatment equipment was calculated using actual data from the radiotherapy department. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of scans (+16%), the number of patients treated (+11.6%) and the volume of hours available for treatment (+12%). Also, there was a decrease in the total number of fractions (-5%), in the average number of fractions performed per treatment sequence (-19%), in the occupancy rate of the machines (-7%) and in the average number of fractions performed per patient treated for malignant tumours of the bronchi and lung (-38%), digestive organs (-37%), secondary (-19%) breast (-15%) and prostate (-15%). The number of fractions administered per treatment sequence between 2015 and 2019 decreased significantly for patients in age groups [20-69] (P<0.001) and [>70] (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: A paradox appears between the increase in the total number of patients treated and the decrease in the loading rate of linacs. This shift of workload has an impact on the quality and safety of care and on the organizational and investment strategies. It also has an economic impact where the model of reimbursement is based on per fraction pricing.

We describe how regular reflective rounds were designed and implemented within an existing educational program at a UK children's hospital and report on the feedback received from participants. METHODS: Eight face-to-face reflective rounds took place in Southampton Children's Hospital, UK, from September 2017 to February 2020 with a further virtual round in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each round was facilitated by a clinical psychologist and consultant. For each round, up to three volunteer panellists from different staff groups were invited to share their personal experiences on a pre-selected subject to the large group. The group would then contribute to the discussion by offering their own reflections. Feedback forms were distributed to attendees and collated. RESULTS: Eight rounds were held with mean attendance of 32 (range 19-47). Across the eight rounds, the total attendance was 256 staff members. The virtual round had 20 participants. Feedback was received from 202 participants. The majority (98%) would recommend the rounds to colleagues with 64 participants (32%) rating the rounds as 'exceptional' and 91 (45%) as 'excellent'. The virtual round received similar positive feedback. CONCLUSION: Large group reflective practice can be implemented within an existing regular educational program. Rounds have been well received by participants and are likely to be of relevance and value to other healthcare groups. The rounds can also be delivered effectively virtually, which may increase participation.","Baker, Jonathan; Savage, Amy; Pendleton, Shannon; Bate, Jessica M",J. paediatr. child health,,614
451150,Ophthalmic emergency-room visits during the Covid-19 pandemic - a comparative study,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a tool to speed up triage in ultrasound scans and provide clinicians with fast access to relevant information. The proposed video-summarization technique is a step in this direction that provides clinicians access to relevant key-frames from a given ultrasound scan (such as lung ultrasound) while reducing resource, storage and bandwidth requirements. We propose a new unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) framework with novel rewards that facilitates unsupervised learning avoiding tedious and impractical manual labelling for summarizing ultrasound videos to enhance its utility as a triage tool in the emergency department (ED) and for use in telemedicine. Using an attention ensemble of encoders, the high dimensional image is projected into a low dimensional latent space in terms of: a) reduced distance with a normal or abnormal class (classifier encoder), b) following a topology of landmarks (segmentation encoder), and c) the distance or topology agnostic latent representation (convolutional autoencoders). The decoder is implemented using a bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) which utilizes the latent space representation from the encoder. Our new paradigm for video summarization is capable of delivering classification labels and segmentation of key landmarks for each of the summarized keyframes. Validation is performed on lung ultrasound (LUS) dataset, that typically represent potential use cases in telemedicine and ED triage acquired from different medical centers across geographies (India, Spain and Canada).","Mathews, Roshan P; Panicker, Mahesh Raveendranatha; Hareendranathan, Abhilash R; Chen, Yale Tung; Jaremko, Jacob L; Buchanan, Brian; Narayan, Kiran Vishnu; Kesavadas, C; Mathews, Greeta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01309v1.pdf,614
451151,Ophthalmic emergency-room visits during the Covid-19 pandemic - a comparative study,2021,"Balancing the antitumor activity and systemic toxicity of tripterine still faces a big challenge due to the narrow therapeutic window. To address this issue, we report a microemulsion system based on tripterine, brucea oil, and glycyrrhizin, and dual modified with both transferrin and cell-penetrating peptide SA-R6H4 (Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs) for combinational and tumor-targeted cancer therapy. Such a microemulsion exhibited a spherical shape with a size of ~50 nm and a mildly-negative charge. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs against ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells was 0.27 ± 0.43 µg tripterine/mL, which was 5.85 times lower than that of free tripterine. The cellular uptake of tripterine after treatment with Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs was 1.56 times higher than that of TBG-MEs (non-modified microemulsion). In pharmacokinetics studies, the area under the curve of Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs increased by 1.97 times compared with that of the physical mixture group. The tumoral accumulation of tripterine was significantly improved in Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs group than TBG-MEs-treated group. In antitumor efficacy in vivo, Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs exhibited the strongest inhibition of tumor growth and the longest survival period among all the groups, which is associated with the rational combination, microemulsion system, and dual modification with tumor-targeted ligands. Importantly, Tf/SA-R6H4-TBG-MEs significantly reduced the toxicity of tripterine against the liver and kidney. Our design provides a new approach for efficient and safe ovarian cancer therapy based on a multicomponent combination.","Zhao, Haijun; Chen, Mengyuan; Zhao, Zhujiang; Zhu, Linjia; Yuan, Shaofei",Drug deliv. transl. res.

An Assessment of Resident Experiences in Cities of Major Virus Outbreak,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To compare recovery kinematics following trip-simulated perturbation during gait between three groups: adults without knee Osteoarthritis (OA) and adults with OA, scheduled and not scheduled for Total Knee Replacement (TKR). METHODS: People with OA scheduled for TKR (TKR group; N = 19) and not scheduled (NTKR group; N = 17) were age-matched with People without OA (N = 19). Outcome measures included: joint range of motion (ROM), Timed Up and Go (TUG), joint pain levels, Oxford score, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire, and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale. Also, spatiotemporal gait parameters and joint kinematics were recorded during perturbed and unperturbed gait. The perturbed gait data were normalized by unperturbed gait data. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two OA groups in the four questionnaire scores and joint ROM. The TUG score of the TKR group was higher than that of the NTKR group. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in the normalized spatiotemporal parameters. The OA groups showed statistically significant lower anterior pelvic tilt ranges and higher maximal hip adduction of the contralateral limb compared to the Non-OA group. When the contralateral limb was perturbed, the TKR group showed significantly lower pelvic rotation range compared to the NTKR and Non-OA groups. When the OA limb was perturbed, the maximal hip flexion of the injured limb was significantly lower and the maximal knee flexion higher in the OA groups compared with the Non-OA group. CONCLUSION: The recovery strategy from trip-simulated perturbation of individuals with OA differs from that of individuals without OA. This may emphasize the importance of devising a treatment plan that focuses on improving balance and reactions to gait perturbation.","Elkarif, Vicktoria; Kandel, Leonid; Rand, Debbie; Schwartz, Isabella; Greenberg, Alexander; Portnoy, Sigal",Gait Posture,,614
452327,Can online activities substitute in-person activities for older persons during COVID-19?,2020,"AIMS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is a ubiquitous finding in inpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related deaths, but recent reports have also described additional atypical findings, including vascular changes. An aim of this study was to assess lung autopsy findings in COVID-19 inpatients, and in untreated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive individuals who died in the community, in order to understand the relative impact of medical intervention on lung histology. Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 represents a unique histological variant of DAD by comparing the pathological findings with those of uninfected control patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lung sections from autopsy cases were reviewed by three pulmonary pathologists, including two who were blinded to patient cohort. The cohorts included four COVID-19 inpatients, four cases with postmortem SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses who died in the community, and eight SARS-CoV-2-negative control cases. DAD was present in all but one SARS-CoV-2-positive patient, who was asymptomatic and died in the community. Although SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were noted to have more focal perivascular inflammation/endothelialitis than control patients, there were no significant differences in the presence of hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi, airspace organisation, and 'acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia'-like intra-alveolar fibrin deposition between the cohorts. Fibrinoid vessel wall necrosis, haemorrhage and capillaritis were not features of COVID-19-related DAD. CONCLUSIONS: DAD is the primary histological manifestation of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients who die both in hospital and in the community, suggesting no contribution of hyperoxaemic mechanical ventilation to the histological changes. There are no distinctive morphological features with which to confidently differentiate COVID-19-related DAD from DAD due to other causes.","Konopka, Kristine E; Nguyen, Teresa; Jentzen, Jeffrey M; Rayes, Omar; Schmidt, Carl J; Wilson, Allecia M; Farver, Carol F; Myers, Jeffrey L",Histopathology,,614

453216,Remaining vigilant about COVID-19 and suicide,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome that presents with severe symptoms which can lead to dangerous and lethal conditions if not diagnosed and treated properly. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that can occur in severe cases with acute pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. In these cases, ICU admission is necessary. CASE SUMMARY: A 59-year-old Caucasian man with septic shock and bilateral interstitial pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 and schizotypal personality disorder presented with catatonic behaviour manifested by soporous state, response to intense painful stimuli with opening of the eyes, execution of simple verbal commands, maintenance of the same position, catalepsy, immobility, rigidity and mutism. At the same time, there were symptoms of septic shock and catatonic symptoms causing greater difficulty in the correct formulation of the diagnosis. During the course of his hospitalization, he was treated with asenapine 20 mg/day. The catatonia responded rapidly and significantly to the asenapine. DISCUSSION: To date, the pathophysiology of catatonia is unclear and few guidelines are available for the treatment of catatonia. In the literature, studies have reported the efficacy of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam, GABAA agonists such as zolpidem, NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine, antidepressant SSRIs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine and antipsychotics such as olanzapine, clozapine and aripiprazole. We demonstrate that the antipsychotic asenapine is also effective in treating catatonic symptoms in psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: Asenapine produced a rapid and significant reduction in catatonic symptoms in our patient with schizotypal personality disorder.","Fiaschè, F; Adriani, B; Mancinelli, I; Taranto, A","CNS neurol. disord., Drug targets (Online)",,614

456622,Digital eye strain in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: An emerging public health threat,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with chronic pain are uniquely challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, as increased stress may exacerbate chronic pain, and there are new barriers to receiving chronic pain treatment. In light of this, using a large online sample in the United States, we examined 1) the early impact of COVID-19 on pain severity, pain interference, and chronic pain management; and 2) variables associated with perceived changes in pain severity and pain interference. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Online survey data for 1,453 adults with chronic pain were collected via Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. RESULTS: Although a large proportion of participants reported no perceived changes in their pain severity and pain interference since the outbreak, approximately 25-30% of individuals reported exacerbation in these domains. Individuals identifying as Black and of non-Hispanic origin, who experienced greater disruptions in their mood and sleep quality, were more likely to report worsened pain interference. The majority of participants reported engaging in self-management strategies as usual. However, most appointments for chronic pain treatment were either postponed or canceled, with no future session scheduled. Furthermore, a notable proportion of participants had concerns about or difficulty accessing prescription opioids due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We may expect to see a long-term exacerbation of chronic pain and related interference in functioning and chronic pain management among individuals most impacted by the pandemic. These individuals may benefit from remotely delivered intervention to effectively mitigate COVID-19-related exacerbations in chronic pain and interruptions in face-to-face treatment.","Mun, Chung Jung; Campbell, Claudia M; McGill, Lakeya S; Aaron, Rachel V",Pain Med,,614

A six-step conceptual framework was then developed to prioritize the changes brought by the size of people's presences in the city streets, which involved the identification of the perceptual qualities, the influence of the socio-morphological characteristics, and the effect of the affective atmospheres on the street environment situations.

458619,Covid-19: the precarious position of Spain's nursing homes,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic is currently decimating the world's most advanced technologies and largest economies and making its way to the continent of Africa. Weak medical infrastructure and over-reliance on medical aids may eventually predict worse outcomes in Africa. To reverse this trend, Africa must re-evaluate the only area with strategic advantage; phytotherapy. One of the many plants with previous antiviral potency is against RNA viruses is Aframomum melegueta. In this study, one hundred (100) A. melegueta secondary metabolites have been mined and computational evaluated for inhibition of host furin, and SARS-COV-2 targets including 3C-like proteinase (Mpro /3CLpro ), 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) and surface glycoprotein/ACE2 receptor interface. Silica-gel column partitioning of A. melegueta fruit/seed resulted in 6 fractions tested against furin activity. Diarylheptanoid (Letestuianin A), phenylpropanoid (4-Cinnamoyl-3-hydroxy-spiro[furan-5,2'-(1'H)-indene]-1',2,3'(2'H,5H)-trione), flavonoids (Quercetin, Apigenin and Tectochrysin) have been identified as high-binding compounds to SARS-COV-2 targets in a polypharmacology manner. Di-ethyl-ether (IC50 = 0.03 mg/L), acetone (IC50 = 1.564 mg/L), ethyl-acetate (IC50 = 0.382 mg/L) and methanol (IC50 = 0.438 mg/L) fractions demonstrated the best inhibition in kinetic assay while DEF, ASF and MEF completely inhibited furin-recognition sequence containing Ebola virus-pre-glycoprotein. In conclusion, A. melegueta and its secondary metabolites have potential for addressing the therapeutic needs of African population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Omotuyi, I Olaposi; Nash, Oyekanmi; Ajiboye, Basiru O; Olumekun, Victor O; Oyinloye, Babatunji E; Osuntokun, Oludare T; Olonisakin, Adebisi; Ajayi, A Olajide; Olusanya, Olasehinde; Akomolafe, Funmilola S; Adelakun, Niyi",Phytother. res,,614

Moreover, passively administered antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. However, the degree to which SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to evade neutralizing antibodies is unclear. Using a recombinant chimeric VSV/SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus, we show that functional SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain that confer resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can be readily selected. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S variants that resist commonly elicited neutralizing antibodies are now present at low frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 populations. Finally, the emergence of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants that might limit the therapeutic usefulness of monoclonal antibodies can be mitigated by the use of antibody combinations that target distinct neutralizing epitopes.","Weisblum, Yiska; Schmidt, Fabian; Zhang, Fengwen; DaSilva, Justin; Poston, Daniel; Lorenzi, Julio Cc; Muecksch, Frauke; Rutkowska, Magdalena; Hoffmann, Hans-Heinrich; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Gaebler, Christian; Agudelo, Marianna; Cho, Alice; Wang, Zijun; Gazumyan, Anna; Cipolla, Melissa; Luchsinger, Larry; Hillyer, Christopher D; Caskey, Marina; Robbiani, Davide F; Rice, Charles M; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D",eLife (Cambridge),,614

This study explored why the integration of traditional medicines with the biomedical healthcare system in Qokolweni in Eastern Cape, South Africa was stalling. The research employed qualitative research methods; participant observation and in-depth ethnographic interviews of community members, traditional healers, and nurses. The study found that: traditional medicines are widely used in Qokolweni due to accessibility and long-built trust; the practice is broad and not certified. To achieve the integration of traditional medicine into the conventional health systems, the central government needs to show political will by setting up regulatory strategies that provide for the scientific evaluation and certification of traditional medicines. This will build confidence among biomedical scientists and health practitioners, thereby fostering easy collaboration and integration.","Mutola, Sianga; Pemunta, Ngambouk Vitalis; Ngo, Ngo Valery",Complement Ther Clin Pract,,614

461562,"Shifts in office and virtual primary care during the early COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada",2021,"The models used to estimate disease transmission, susceptibility and severity determine what epidemiology can (and cannot tell) us about COVID-19. These include: 'model organisms' chosen for their phylogenetic/aetiological similarities; multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of (potentially causal) relationships between variables (through 'causal inference'), and the (past/future) value of unmeasured variables (through 'classification/prediction'); and a range of modelling techniques to predict beyond the available data (through 'extrapolation'), compare different hypothetical scenarios (through 'simulation'), and estimate key features of dynamic processes (through 'projection'). Each of these models: address different questions using different techniques; involve assumptions that require careful assessment; and are vulnerable to generic and specific biases that can undermine the validity and interpretation of their findings. It is therefore necessary that the models used: can actually address the questions posed; and have been competently applied. In this regard, it is important to stress that extrapolation, simulation and projection cannot offer accurate predictions of future events when the underlying mechanisms (and the contexts involved) are poorly understood and subject to change. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms/contexts, and the limited opportunity for experimentation during outbreaks of novel diseases, the use of multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of potentially causal relationships between two variables (and the biases incurred through their misapplication/misinterpretation) warrant particular attention. Such models must be carefully designed to address: 'selection-collider bias', 'unadjusted confounding bias' and 'inferential mediator adjustment bias' - all of which can introduce effects capable of enhancing, masking or reversing the estimated (true) causal relationship between the two variables examined.1 Selection-collider bias occurs when these two variables independently cause a third (the 'collider'), and when this collider determines/reflects the basis for selection in the analysis. It is likely to affect all incompletely representative samples, although its effects will be most pronounced wherever selection is constrained (e.g. analyses focusing on infected/hospitalised individuals). Unadjusted confounding bias disrupts the estimated (true) causal relationship between two variables when: these share one (or more) common cause(s); and when the effects of these causes have not been adjusted for in the analyses (e.g. whenever confounders are unknown/unmeasured). Inferentially similar biases can occur when: one (or more) variable(s) (or 'mediators') fall on the causal path between the two variables examined (i.e. when such mediators are caused by one of the variables and are causes of the other); and when these mediators are adjusted for in the analysis. Such adjustment is commonplace when: mediators are mistaken for confounders; prediction models are mistakenly repurposed for causal inference; or mediator adjustment is used to estimate direct and indirect causal relationships (in a mistaken attempt at 'mediation analysis'). These three biases are central to ongoing and unresolved epistemological tensions within epidemiology. All have substantive implications for our understanding of COVID-19, and the future application of artificial intelligence to 'data-driven' modelling of similar phenomena. Nonetheless, competently applied and carefully interpreted, multivariable statistical models may yet provide sufficient insight into mechanisms and contexts to permit more accurate projections of future disease outbreaks.","Ellison, George T H",Ann Hum Biol,,614

In this endemic situation, with massive flows of patients requiring holistic management including specific and intensive care, the appropriate assessment of each patient's level of care and the organisation of specific networks is essential. To that end, we propose here a territorial organisation of health care, favouring communication between all actors. This organisation of care is based on three key points: To use the basis of territorial organisation of health by facilitating the link between hospital settings and geriatric sectors at the regional level.To connect private, medico-social and hospital actors through a dedicated centralised unit for evaluation, geriatric coordination of care and decision support. A geriatrician coordinates this multidisciplinary unit. It includes an emergency room doctor, a supervisor from the medical regulation centre (Centre 15), an infectious disease physician, a medical hygienist and a palliative care specialist.To organise an ad hoc follow-up channel, including the necessary resources for the different levels of care required, according to the resources of the territorial network, and the creation of a specific COVID geriatric palliative care service. This organisation meets the urgent health needs of all stakeholders, facilitating its deployment and allows the sustainable implementation of a coordinated geriatric management dynamic between the stakeholders on the territory.","Koeberle, Séverine; Tannou, Thomas; Bouiller, Kévin; Becoulet, Nicolas; Outrey, Justin; Chirouze, Catherine; Aubry, Régis",Age Ageing,,614

Pregnant and non-pregnant were compared for frequencies of events, including SARS-CoV-2 testing, symptoms and hospitalization rates. Multivariable regression was used to investigate symptoms severity and comorbidity effects. Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not different in syndromic severity, except for gastrointestinal symptoms. Pregnant were more likely to have received testing, despite reporting fewer symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with syndromic severity in pregnant hospitalized. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% pregnant, 92% non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant who were hospitalized.

However, following a report from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of European Medicines Agency, which reported an association with thrombo-embolic events (TEE), in particular disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), many European countries either limited it to individuals older than 55–60 years or suspended its use. We used publicly available data to carry out a quantitative benefit–risk analysis of the vaccine among people under 60 in Italy. Specifically, we used data from PRAC, Eudravigilance and ECDC to estimate the excess number of deaths for TEE, DIC and CVST expected in vaccine users, stratified by age groups. We then used data from the National Institute of Health to calculate age-specific COVID-19 mortality rates in Italy. Preventable deaths were calculated assuming a 72% vaccine efficacy over an eight-month period. Finally, the benefit–risk ratio of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was calculated as the ratio of preventable COVID-19 deaths to vaccine-related deaths, using Monte-Carlo simulations. We found that among subjects aged 20–29 years the benefit–risk (B-R) ratio was not clearly favorable (0.70;95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): 0.27–2.11). However, in the other age groups the benefits of vaccination largely exceeded the risks (for age 30–49, B-R ratio: 22.9: 95%UI: 10.1–186.4). For age 50–59, B-R ratio: 1577.1: 95%UI: 1176.9–2121.5). Although many countries have limited the use of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the benefits of using this vaccine clearly outweigh the risks in people older than 30 years. Study limitations included risk of underreporting and that we did not provide age-specific estimates. The use of this vaccine should be a strategic and fundamental part of the immunization campaign considering its safety and efficacy in preventing COVID-19 and its complications.","Palladino, Raffaele Ceriotti Daniele De Ambrosi Damiano De Vito Marta Farsoni Marco Seminara Giuseppina Barone-Adesi Francesco",Vaccines,,614
464419,‘a Lion Sleeping next to Me’: Preliminary Considerations on the Psychological Consequences of Surviving Covid-19,2021,"For 35 years, our laboratory has been involved in identifying psychosocial factors that predict who becomes ill when they are exposed to a virus affecting the upper respiratory tract. To pursue this question, we used a unique viral-challenge design in which we assessed behavioral, social, and psychological factors in healthy adults. We subsequently exposed these adults to a cold or influenza virus and then monitored them in quarantine for 5 to 6 days for onset of respiratory illness. Factors we found to be associated with greater risk of respiratory illnesses after virus exposure included smoking, ingesting an inadequate level of vitamin C, and chronic psychological stress. Those associated with decreased risk included social integration, social support, physical activity, adequate and efficient sleep, and moderate alcohol intake. We cautiously suggest that our findings could have implications for identifying who becomes ill when exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This argument is based on evidence that the associations we report are replicable across multiple respiratory viruses and that the pathways found to link psychosocial factors to colds and influenza may play similar roles in COVID-19.","Cohen, Sheldon",Perspect Psychol Sci,,614

We adapted multiple items from the following tools: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Social Phobia Inventory, Health Anxiety Inventory, Swine Influenza Anxiety Scale and the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety to design our new assessment tool which is called COVID-19 Psychological Distress Scale (CPDS). For psychometric analyses and validation, we conducted a cross-sectional study that solicited data through a web-based survey using the newly developed CPDS. This validation study was conducted in four Arab countries, including Algeria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. A total of 1337 participants from these countries have voluntarily responded to our survey questionnaire that included the newly developed scale. The final version of the CPDS comprised 12 items. Participants from Algeria (n=447), Kuwait (n=437), Saudi Arabia (n=160) and Yemen (n=293) have completed the 12-item CPDS. Exploratory factor analysis (used on the Algerian sample) suggested a two-factor structure of the CPDS. The two-factor structure was then supported by the confirmatory factor analysis with an independent sample. Additionally, Rasch analyses showed that all the items fit well in their embedded construct;only one item showed somewhat substantial differential item functioning across gender and country. The 12-item CPDS was found to be measurement invariant across country and gender. The CPDS, with its promising psychometric properties, might help healthcare professionals to identify people with COVID-19-induced psychological distress.","Fares, Z.; Al-Tammemi, A. B.; F.

The antivirals are important measures to this epidemic; however, there is no drug approved for against coronavirus yet. With the continuously rising number of confirmed/suspected cases of COVID-19, it is urgent to obtain antiviral drugs for the clinical treatment. In response to this situation, drug repurposing strategy becomes one of the best approaches for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery. By retrieving the clinical trials registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov, a total of 14 chemical drugs were registered for COVID-19. In this review, we summarize and analyze the 14 drugs' indications, targets, and research basis related to the activities against viral infections, esp. coronavirus infections. We are making efforts to understand the evidence basis of these drugs for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection applied by various research and clinical institutions in response to this COVID-19 outbreak, and also providing clues for quick response to possible epidemic in future and reasonable expansion of the indications of drugs.","ZHANG, Chao; CHEN, Shu-bing; ZHANG, Jie; GUO, Ying",Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica,,614

465865,What is the rate of COVID-19 infection in a population seeking dental care?,2021,"The NHS 111 telephone advice and triage service is a vital part of the management of urgent and emergency care (UEC) services in England. Demand for NHS 111 advice has increased since its introduction in 2013, and the service is of particular importance in light of the current pandemic and resulting increased demand for emergency care. Currently, little is known about the effectiveness of NHS 111 in terms of the appropriateness of the advice given, or about the compliance of patients with that advice. We aimed to address this issue by analysing a large linked routine dataset of all NHS 111 calls (n = 3,631,069) and subsequent emergency department (ED) attendances made in the Yorkshire & Humber region from March 2013-March 2017. We found that many patients do not comply with advice, with 11% (n = 289,748) of patients attending ED when they are advised to self-care or seek primary care. We also found that a considerable number of these patients are further classed as urgent (88%, n = 255,931) and a substantial minority (37%, 106,207) are subsequently admitted to hospital. Further, many patients who are sent an ambulance or told to attend ED are classed as non-urgent upon attending ED (9%, n = 42,372). This research suggests that the level at which NHS 111 is currently triaging results in many hundreds of thousands of mis-triaged cases annually. Additionally, patients frequently do not comply with the advice they receive. This has implications for understanding the accuracy and efficiency of triaging systems.","Lewis, Jen; Stone, Tony; Simpson, Rebecca; Jacques, Richard; O039,; Keeffe, Colin; Croft, Susan; Mason, Suzanne",PLoS One,,614

This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover, assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates and the influence of test volume.","Wieland, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07209v3.pdf,614

The PLpro have significant functional implications in the innate immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and considered an important antiviral target. Both proteases share strikingly similar USP fold with right-handed thumb-palm-fingers structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad Cys-His-Asp/Asn. In this urgency situation of COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of in-vitro facilities readily available to test SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in whole-cell assays. Therefore, we adopted an alternate route to identify potential USP2 inhibitor through integrated in-silico efforts. After an extensive virtual screening protocol, the best compounds were selected and tested. The compound Z93 showed significant IC50 value against Jurkat (9.67 µM) and MOTL-4 cells (11.8 µM). The binding mode of Z93 was extensively analyzed through molecular docking, followed by MD simulations, and molecular interactions were compared with SARS-CoV-2. The relative binding poses of Z93 fitted well in the binding site of both proteases and showed consensus &#960;-&#960; stacking and H-bond interactions with histidine and aspartate/asparagine residues of the catalytic triad. These results led us to speculate that compound Z93 might be the first potential chemical lead against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, which warrants in-vitro evaluations.","Mirza, Muhammad Usman; Ahmad, Sarfraz; Abdullah, Iskandar; Froeyen, Matheus",Comput Biol Chem,,614

467120,An Overview of COVID -19 and Dental Treatment Options,2020,"Against the backdrop of the exponentially growing trend in green finance investments and the calls for green recovery in the post-COVID world, this study presents the time-frequency connectedness between green and conventional financial markets by using the spillover models of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and Baruník and Křehlík (2018). Covering a sample period from January 01, 2008, to July 31, 2020, we aim to explore the dynamics of connectedness between conventional and green investments in fixed income, equity, and energy markets. Additionally, we determine the role of market-wide uncertainty in altering the connectedness structure by performing a subsample analysis for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic crisis period. Our results show that competing energy investments are not connected, and there is only one-way spillovers from the conventional bonds in the fixed-income investments. Additionally, we observe a low (high) intergroup connectedness for conventional (green) investments. Moreover, the frequency-based analysis shows that connectedness between these competing markets is more pronounced during the short-run. The subsample analysis for the pandemic crisis period shows similar results except for the disconnection between bond markets in the short-run frequency. Our time-varying analysis shows peaks and troughs in the connectedness between climate-friendly and conventional investments that suggest different global events such as the Eurozone Debt Crisis and Shale Oil Revolution drives the association between alternate investments. Similarly, we observe an enhanced connectedness during the recent COVID-19 period, suggesting that financial stability would be a significant factor in determining the smooth transition to green investments. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Arif, M.; Hasan, M.; Alawi, S.

467738,Care in times of COVID-19: the impact of the pandemic on informal caregiving in Austria,2021,"The transcription factor STAT3 is frequently activated in human solid and hematological malignancies and remains a challenging therapeutic target with no approved drugs to date. Here, we develop synthetic antibody mimetics, termed monobodies, to interfere with STAT3 signaling. These monobodies are highly selective for STAT3 and bind with nanomolar affinity to the N-terminal and coiled-coil domains. Interactome analysis detects no significant binding to other STATs or additional off-target proteins, confirming their exquisite specificity. Intracellular expression of monobodies fused to VHL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor, results in degradation of endogenous STAT3. The crystal structure of STAT3 in complex with monobody MS3-6 reveals bending of the coiled-coil domain, resulting in diminished DNA binding and nuclear translocation. MS3-6 expression strongly inhibits STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation and disrupts STAT3 interaction with the IL-22 receptor. Therefore, our study establishes innovative tools to interfere with STAT3 signaling by different molecular mechanisms.","La Sala, Grégory; Michiels, Camille; Kükenshöner, Tim; Brandstoetter, Tania; Maurer, Barbara; Koide, Akiko; Lau, Kelvin; Pojer, Florence; Koide, Shohei; Sexl, Veronika; Dumoutier, Laure; Hantschel, Oliver",Nat Commun,,614

As one of the efficient solutions, mechanical harvest/auto-harvest that is based on object detection and robotic harvester becomes an urgent need. Within the auto-harvest system, robust few-shot object detection model is one of the bottlenecks, since the system is required to deal with new vegetable/fruit categories and the collection of large-scale annotated datasets for all the novel categories is expensive. There are many few-shot object detection models that were developed by the community. Yet whether they could be employed directly for real life agricultural applications is still questionable, as there is a context-gap between the commonly used training datasets and the images collected in real life agricultural scenarios. To this end, in this study, we present a novel cucumber dataset and propose two data augmentation strategies that help to bridge the context-gap. Experimental results show that 1) the state-of-the-art few-shot object detection model performs poorly on the novel 'cucumber' category;and 2) the proposed augmentation strategies outperform the commonly used ones.","Riou, K.; Zhu, J.

In Israel, healthcare personnel (HCP) were initially prioritized for Covid-19 vaccination, creating an ideal setting to evaluate real-world VE in a closely monitored population. MethodsWe conducted a prospective study among HCP in 6 hospitals to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants filled out weekly symptom questionnaires, provided weekly nasal specimens, and three serology samples - at enrollment, 30 days and 90 days. We estimated VE against PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using the Cox Proportional Hazards model and against a combined PCR/serology endpoint using Fishers exact test. FindingsOf the 1,567 HCP enrolled between December 27, 2020 and February 15, 2021, 1,250 previously uninfected participants were included in the primary analysis; 998 (79.8%) were vaccinated with their first dose prior to or at enrollment, all with Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. There were four PCR-positive events among vaccinated participants, and nine among unvaccinated participants. Adjusted two-dose VE against any PCR- confirmed infection was 94.5% (95% CI: 82.6%-98.2%); adjusted two-dose VE against a combined endpoint of PCR and seroconversion for a 60-day follow-up period was 94.5% (95% CI: 63.0%-99.0%). Five PCR-positive samples from study participants were sequenced; all were alpha variant.

Also, vitamin D deficiency attenuate the immune system and predispose a person more susceptible to infection. In this context, we aimed to evaluate vitamin D, Electrolytes, Complete blood count, Liver enzymes, Urea, Creatinine, Albumin, CRP and ESR levels in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 118 patients with Covid-19 who were hospitalized from 2020/2/19 to 2020/4/3 in ICU. Serum levels of electrolytes, liver enzymes, blood factors, urea, creatinine, CRP and ESR as well as anthropometric parameters and serum vitamin D concentration were measured. RESULTS: A total of 118 patients (80 male and 38 female) was enrolled in the study (65.05±15.75 years). Only 5.08% of patients had no risk factors and 55.9% had &#8805; 2 risk factors. Diabetes (44.1%) and obesity (23.7%) were more common among patients. Laboratory finding showed that 80.50% of patients had hyponatremia, but other electrolytes included K, Mg, Ca and P were normal in majority of participants as well as CBC, Cr, Urea, Alb, ALT and ALKP. The AST concentration increased in most patients (66.94%). All patients had high levels of inflammatory factors such as CRP and ESR. The mean of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels in participants (25.95 ± 14.56 ng/mL) was lower than its levels in general papulation. However, it was not statistically significant (P= 0.88). A significant negative correlation found between vitamin D and ALT (P= 0.02, -0.21) as well as vitamin D and CRP (P= 0.05, -0.17).

471436,Therapy with RAS inhibitors during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: We conduced retrospective analyses on two cohorts comprising 7699 pregnant women in Beijing, China, and compared pregnancy outcomes between the pre-COVID-2019 cohort (women who delivered from 20 May 2019 to 30 November 2019) and the COVID-2019 cohort (women who delivered from 20 January 2020 to 31 July 2020). The secondary impacts of the COVID-2019 pandemic on pregnancy outcomes were assessed by using multivariate log-binomial regression models, and we used interrupted time-series (ITS) regression analysis to further control the effects of time-trends. SETTING: One tertiary-level centre in Beijing, China PARTICIPANTS: 7699 pregnant women. RESULTS: Compared with women in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic group, pregnant women during the COVID-2019 pandemic were more likely to be of advanced age, exhibit insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain and show a family history of chronic disease (all p<0.05). After controlling for other confounding factors, the risk of premature rupture of membranes and foetal distress was increased by 11% (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18; p<0.01) and 14% (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29; p<0.05), respectively, during the COVID-2019 pandemic. The association still remained in the ITS analysis after additionally controlling for time-trends (all p<0.01). We uncovered no other associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and other pregnancy outcomes (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more women manifested either insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain; and the risk of premature rupture of membranes and foetal distress was also higher during the pandemic.","Du, Min; Yang, Jie; Han, Na; Liu, Min; Liu, Jue",BMJ Open,,614

471461,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery,2021,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as banning public events or instituting lockdowns have been widely applied around the world to control the current COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold. Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use? In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators. Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated using indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of models.","Castillo-Laborde, Carla; Wolff, Taco de; Gajardo, Pedro; Lecaros, Rodrigo; Olivar, Gerard; HectorRamirez, C",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01036v1.pdf,614

472057,Will Virtual Teaching Continue After the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2020,"Hypertension is a common comorbidity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to estimate the risks of adverse events associated with in-hospital blood pressure (BP) control and the effects of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) prescription in COVID-19 patients with concomitant hypertension. In this retrospective cohort study, the anonymized medical records of COVID-19 patients were retrieved from an acute field hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical data, drug prescriptions, and laboratory investigations were collected for individual patients with diagnosed hypertension on admission. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risks of adverse outcomes associated with BP control during the hospital stay. Of 803 hypertensive patients, 67 (8.3%) were admitted to the ICU, 30 (3.7%) had respiratory failure, 26 (3.2%) had heart failure, and 35 (4.8%) died. After adjustment for confounders, the significant predictors of heart failure were average systolic blood pressure (SBP) (hazard ratio (HR) per 10 mmHg 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 3.13) and pulse pressure (HR per 10 mmHg 2.71, 95% CI: 1.39, 5.29). The standard deviations of SBP and diastolic BP were independently associated with mortality and ICU admission. The risk estimates of poor BP control were comparable between patients receiving ARBs and those not receiving ARBs, with the only exception of a high risk of heart failure in the non-ARB group. Poor BP control was independently associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes of COVID-19. ARB drugs did not increase the risks of adverse events in hypertensive patients.","Ran, Jinjun; Song, Ying; Zhuang, Zian; Han, Lefei; Zhao, Shi; Cao, Peihua; Geng, Yan; Xu, Lin; Qin, Jing; He, Daihai; Wu, Fengfu; Yang, Lin",Hypertens Res,,614

AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of these treatments, alone or combined, on the neuropsychological profiles of patients with AD. METHODS: Forty participants were assigned to three groups receiving either only AChEI (n = 14), AChEI + CS (n = 15), or only CS (n = 11). Cognition was evaluated at baseline and after three months. Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate differences among the treatments in terms of changes in the patients' neuropsychological profiles. RESULTS: Results, although preliminary because of the small sample size, suggest that a general improvement was found in patients who received AChEI + CS and those who received only CS compared with those who received only AChEI. Interestingly, individuals who received only CS showed a significant improvement in immediate memory recall than those who received only AChEI. Furthermore, the group receiving AChEI + CS showed an improvement in delayed recall than the other two groups. DISCUSSION: The combination of AChEI and CS seems to have the greatest benefit for patients with mild AD. More interestingly, CS alone is more effective than AChEI alone, even in improving memory, considered to be the ""lost"" cognitive domain in AD.","Devita, Maria; Masina, Fabio; Mapelli, Daniela; Anselmi, Pasquale; Sergi, Giuseppe; Coin, Alessandra",Aging clin. exp. res,,614

This foodborne illness, which reportedly most likely originated in a seafood market where wild animals are sold illegally, has transmitted among humans through close contact, across the world. The aim of this study is to explore health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward healthy/risky food in the immediate context of food crisis. More specifically, by using the data collected from 1008 respondents in January 2020, the time when China was hit hard by the ""Corona Virus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19), this study investigates the overall and different generational respondents' health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat. The results reveal that, firstly, based on their food health and risk perceptions of healthy and risky food, the respondents' general attitudes are positive toward organic food but relatively negative toward game meat. Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations' attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values. In addition, this research also indicates that the COVID-19 crisis influences the respondents' perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat consumption. However, the likelihood of its impact on older generations' future change in diets is smaller, which implies that older generations' food beliefs are more stable.","Xie, Xiaoru; Huang, Liman; Li, Jun Justin; Zhu, Hong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,614

It also compares these with the findings from a more comprehensive analysis of Global Health Security (GHS) Index, which assesses the preparedness of the health system for such pandemics. The GHS report (2019) spelt out very objectively that none of the countries of the world was prepared to effectively handle such emergencies, should they arise. Observations emerging from different countries highlight these findings although some of them seem to be discordant. Overall, it appears that Asian countries could fight the battle better than most developed nations in the Europe and America during the current pandemic, despite having poor GHS scores.

Discovered in 2012 by Boström et al., irisin very quickly became an interesting subject in medical research. Irisin has been found in cerebrospinal fluid, the cerebellum, thyroid, pineal gland, liver, pancreas, testis, spleen, adult stomach, and human fetuses. Regarding the actions of irisin, both in animals and humans, the results are contradictory but interesting. Its capability to influence adipose tissue and glycemic homeostasis may be utilized in order to treat hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome, and other endocrine and metabolic disorders. Considering its osteogenic potential, irisin might be a therapeutic choice in diseases caused by a sedentary lifestyle. New data indicate that irisin treatment may serve in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection. Furthermore, several therapeutic agents, such as insulin, metformin, fenofibrate, exenatide, and melatonin, influence the concentrations of irisin in animal models or in humans. Nutritional factors including polyunsaturated fatty acids may also have an effect on irisin concentrations. While it may be “too good to be true,” irisin offers many opportunities for future research that would aim to find its optimal therapeutical role in endocrine and metabolic diseases.","Leustean, Letitia Preda Cristina Teodoriu Laura Mihalache Laura Arhire Lidia Ungureanu Maria-Christina",Applied Sciences,,614

In such applications, researchers are interested in clustering subjects based on potentially high-dimensional longitudinal features, and in investigating how clinical covariates may affect the clustering results. These studies are often challenging due to high dimensionality, as well as the sparse and irregular nature of sample collection along the time dimension. We propose a smoothed probabilistic PARAFAC model with covariates (SPACO) to tackle these two problems while utilizing auxiliary covariates of interest.

Overall, about 10,000 individuals were tested; seropositive subjects were retested after 5 months to evaluate antibodies waning. Among 8769 hospital workers, seroprevalence was 7.6%, without significant differences related to job profile; among 1185 University workers, 3.3%. Self-reporting of COVID-19 suspected symptoms was significantly associated with positivity (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.07, 95%CI: 1.76-2.44), although 27% of seropositive subjects reported no previous symptom. At multivariable analysis, contacts at work resulted in an increased risk of 69%, or 24% for working in a COVID ward; contacts in the household evidenced the highest risk, up to more than five-fold (OR 5.31, 95%CI: 4.12-6.85). Compared to never smokers, being active smokers was inversely associated with seroprevalence (OR 0.60, 95%CI: 0.48-0.76). After 5 months, 85% of previously positive subjects still tested positive. The frequency of SARS-COV-2 infection among Health Care Workers was comparable with that observed in surveys performed in Northern Italy and Europe after the first pandemic wave. This study confirms that infection frequently occurred as asymptomatic and underlines the importance of household exposure, seroprevalence (OR 0.60, 95%CI: 0.48-0.76).","Scozzari, Gitana; Costa, Cristina; Migliore, Enrica; Coggiola, Maurizio; Ciccone, Giovannino; Savio, Luigi; Scarmozzino, Antonio; Pira, Enrico; Cassoni, Paola; Galassi, Claudia; Cavallo, Rossana",Viruses,,614

They need to interact, they need to share. When things are going well everything is smooth sailing. When there is a deviation to this, ripples are seen. Youngsters are a representative lot of this society, who are used to socializing and hanging out with their peer groups, that when they are suddenly faced with a situation of social isolation and inability to mingle with their friends, is highly unpalatable and impossible for them. With the usual stress activators such as academic tests and exams they now have to face the new stress of forced social isolation. Such situational constraints will inevitably cause psychological, physical, and behavioural problems. Objective: The authors have taken for their study the anxiety felt by a group of students who have been forced into a period of social isolation due to situational demands. Methods: The researchers have identified four clusters of parameters to test the mindset of a select group of students. The four clusters contain questions relating to their mindset regarding missing friends, their understanding of loneliness, the psychological impact resulting from this situation, and the coping strategies they employ to tackle the situation. The test-retest methodology is being followed to analyze the data. Result: The analysis of data proved that prolonged periods of peer deprivation will induce the feeling of loneliness among students. Social isolation will make students suffer unknown fears, affect the sleep patterns of students. Not being able to go out and socialize causes stress among students, however, meditation reduces levels of stress among students. When the young minds are not able to meet up with friends like they used to just a few weeks back, they need to understand their problem is a global problem. The problem has to be tackled not only by individuals but also by governments. Conclusion: We face several challenges which have to be tackled both by the government and by individuals. The authors feel that teachers who have direct contact with the student community are uniquely positioned because of their networking with students almost daily. © IJCRR.","Sadasivan, U.; Balachander, B.; Vijayalakshmi, S.",International Journal of Current Research and Review,,614

Given that some medications have shown adverse effects on sperm quality, there might be a transgenerational concern. We aim at examining the association between drugs proposed to treat COVID-19 when taken by the father around conception and any pre-term birth or major birth defects in offspring in a nation-wide cohort study using Danish registry data. Offspring whose father filled at least one prescription of the following medications in the 3 months preceding conception were considered exposed: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, losartan, azithromycin, naproxen, dexamethasone and prednisone. RESULTS: For azithromycin and naproxen, large numbers of offspring were exposed (> 1800 offspring), and we found no association with adverse birth outcomes. For chloroquine, losartan and dexamethasone, exposure was intermediate (~ 900 offspring), and there was no statistically significant association with birth defects. For hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, exposure was limited (< 300 offspring). Our evidence suggests that azithromycin and naproxen are safe with respect to pre-term birth and birth defects. For the other drugs investigated larger exposures are needed for conclusive statements.","Rizzi, Silvia; Wensink, Maarten J; Lindahl-Jacobsen, Rune; Tian, Lu; Lu, Ying; Eisenberg, Michael L",BMC Res Notes,,614
479265,The Role of Infectious Disease trainees during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey,2021,"We present pore-scale simulations of two-phase flows in a reconstructed fibrous porous layer. The three-dimensional microstructure of the material, a fuel cell gas diffusion layer, is acquired via X-ray computed tomography and used as input for lattice Boltzmann simulations. We perform a quantitative analysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics, and we identify the dominant fluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of three different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times, characterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at intermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing number of preferential flow paths of the size of one-two pores, and a third regime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is exclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures are stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant variations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the pore invasion dynamics, and counteract the stabilising viscous force. Liquid transport is indeed affected by the presence of microstructure-induced capillary pressures acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary fingering transport mechanism and unstable front displacement, even in the absence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a macroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects of the such a dynamic capillary pressure. Finally, we underline the significance of the results for the optimal design of face masks in an effort to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Farzaneh, Meisam; Ström, Henrik; Zanini, Filippo; Carmignato, Simone; Sasic, Srdjan; Maggiolo, Dario",Transp Porous Media,,614

480171,Examining effective communication in nursing practice during COVID-19: A large-scale qualitative study,2021,"A hallmark of complex humanitarian emergencies is the collective exposure, often over extended periods of time, to political violence in the forms of war, terrorism, political intimidation, repression, unlawful detention, and forced displacement. Populations in complex humanitarian emergencies have higher risks of multiple co-morbidities: mental disorders, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and chronic non-communicable diseases. However, there is wide variation in the health impacts both across and within humanitarian emergencies. Syndemic theory is an approach to conceptualizing disease and social determinants to understand differential patterns of multi-morbidity, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and better design interventions. Syndemic theory, if applied to complex humanitarian emergencies, has the potential to uncover origins of localized patterns of multi-morbidity resulting from political violence and historical inequities. In this paper, we present two case studies based on mixed-methods research to illustrate how syndemic models can be applied in complex humanitarian emergencies. First, in a Nepal case study, we explore different patterns of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression co-morbidity among female former child soldiers returning home after war. Despite comparable exposure to war-related traumas, girl soldiers in high-caste Hindu communities had 63% co-morbidity of PTSD and depression, whereas girl soldiers in communities with mixed castes and religions, had 8% PTSD prevalence, but no cases of PTSD and depression co-morbidity. In the second case study, we explore the high rates of type 2 diabetes during a spike in political violence and population displacement. Despite low rates of obesity and other common risk factors, Somalis in Ethiopia experienced rising cases of and poor outcomes from type-2 diabetes. Political violence shapes healthcare resources, diets, and potentially, this epidemiological anomaly. Based on these case studies we propose a humanitarian syndemic research agenda for observational and intervention studies, with the central focus being that public health efforts need to target violence prevention at family, community, national, and global levels.","Kohrt, Brandon A; Carruth, Lauren",Soc Sci Med,,614

481953,Adapting the role of handheld echocardiography during the COVID-19 pandemic: A practical guide,2021,"Video compression is a critical component of Internet video delivery. Recent work has shown that deep learning techniques can rival or outperform human-designed algorithms, but these methods are significantly less compute and power-efficient than existing codecs. This paper presents a new approach that augments existing codecs with a small, content-adaptive super-resolution model that significantly boosts video quality. Our method, SRVC, encodes video into two bitstreams: (i) a content stream, produced by compressing downsampled low-resolution video with the existing codec, (ii) a model stream, which encodes periodic updates to a lightweight super-resolution neural network customized for short segments of the video. SRVC decodes the video by passing the decompressed low-resolution video frames through the (time-varying) super-resolution model to reconstruct high-resolution video frames. Our results show that to achieve the same PSNR, SRVC requires 16% of the bits-per-pixel of H.265 in slow mode, and 2% of the bits-per-pixel of DVC, a recent deep learning-based video compression scheme. SRVC runs at 90 frames per second on a NVIDIA V100 GPU.","Khani, Mehrdad; Sivaraman, Vibhaalakshmi; Alizadeh, Mohammad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02322v1.pdf,614

In an effort to curb the spread of the epidemic, the government has requisitioned a variety of venues and plant buildings and built more than 20 cabin hospitals to receive patients with mild symptoms within 48 hours. Under this circumstance, we worked out a 5G all-wireless solution to divide the overall network system of the cabin hospital into multiple network units by function. While ensuring good signal coverage of the local unit, each network unit was independently connected to the host hospital's data center over a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel built on the 5G wireless network. Our successful experience with the application of this 5G + VPN all-wireless network system well points to the bright prospect of 5G wireless network. In addition, the 5G + VPN solution can also be used for multihospital network interconnection and rapid network recovery during the failure of wired network.","Zhou, Bin; Wu, Qing; Zhao, Xuefei; Zhang, Wenchao; Wu, Wenjun; Guo, Zi",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,614

Methods: These were distributed into two groups: experimental, which underwent a fracture of the right mandibular body, and sham-operated, which underwent the surgical access only. The animals were sacrificed at three months of age and, after dissection, the mandible was disarticulated. The skull was submitted to axial radiograph and the hemimandibles to a lateral radiograph. With these, cephalometric mensurations were made through a computer system, and the obtained values submitted to statistical analyses. Results: The length of the maxilla, as well as the height and length of the mandible presented significant difference with decrease to the right side, in the experimental group. In the sham-operated group there was significant difference with decrease to length of posterior part of the maxilla and to height and length of the mandible on the right side. The experimental group when compared to the sham-operated group was significantly lesser in all the mensurations of maxilla and mandible to both sides, except in mandibular length. Conclusion: It was concluded that fracture of the mandibular body, as well as the surgical access, had negative effects on growth of maxilla and mandible.","Maria Villanova Fernandes da Rocha, Elza; Cruvinel Goulart, Alan; Goldenberg, Saul; Gualberto de Cerqueira Luz, João",Acta cir. bras.,,614

In coverage planning, the number of turns in the generated path affects the time to cover the environment and the quality of coverage, e.g. tools like cameras and cleaning attachments commonly have poor performance around turns. In many existing turn-minimizing coverage methods, the environment is partitioned into the least number of ranks, which are non-intersecting rectangles of width equal to the robot's tool width. This partitioning problem is typically solved using heuristics that do not guarantee optimality. In this work, we propose a linear programming (LP) approach to partition the environment into the least number of axis-parallel (horizontal and vertical) ranks with the goal of minimizing the number of turns taken by the robot. We prove that our LP method solves this problem optimally and in polynomial time. We then generate coverage plans for a set of indoor environments using the proposed LP method and compare the results against that of a state-of-the-art coverage approach.","Ramesh, Megnath; Imeson, Frank; Fidan, Baris; Smith, Stephen L.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08185v1.pdf,614

Louisiana was one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic with just over 57,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the end of June 2020. We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during the peak of the pandemic, March 1st through March 31st, to document the type and frequency of neurological problems seen in patients with COVID-19 at presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. A large proportion of our sample (80 %) was African American and had hypertension (79 %). Out of 250 patients, 56 (22 %) patients died, and 72 (29 %) patients required intubation. Thirty-four (14 %) had a neurological chief complaint at presentation; the most common neurological chief complaints in the entire sample were altered mental status (AMS) (8 %), headache (2 %), and syncope (2 %). We used a competing risk model to determine whether neurological symptoms at presentation or during hospital stay were predictors of prolonged hospital stay and death. To establish whether neurological symptoms were associated with higher odds of intubation, we used logistic regression. Age was the only significant demographic predictor of death and hospital stay. The HR (95 %CI) for remaining in the hospital for a ten-year increase in age was 1.2, (1.1, 1.3, pâ¯<â¯0.0001), and for death was 1.3, (1.1, 1.5, pâ¯<â¯0.01). There were no demographic characteristics, including age or comorbidities predictive of intubation. Adjusting for age, patients who at presentation had neurological issues as their chief complaint were at significantly increased risk for remaining in the hospital, HRâ¯=â¯1.7, (1.1,2.5, pâ¯=â¯0.0001), and dying, HRâ¯=â¯2.1(1.1,3.8, pâ¯=â¯0.02), compared to patients without any neurological complaint. Of the individual admission complaints, AMS was associated with a significantly prolonged hospital stay, HRâ¯=â¯1.8, (1.0-3.3, pâ¯=â¯0.05). Patients that required dialysis or intubation or had AMS during hospitalization had more extended hospital stays. After adjusting for age, dialysis, and intubation, patients with AMS during hospital stay had a HR of 1.6, (1.1, 2.5, pâ¯=â¯0.01) for remaining in the hospital. Patients who had statistically significant higher odds of requiring intubation were those who presented with any neurological chief complaint, ORâ¯=â¯2.8 (1.3,5.8, pâ¯=â¯0.01), or with headaches ORâ¯=â¯13.3 (2.1,257.0, pâ¯=â¯0.008). Patients with AMS during the hospital stay, as well as those who had seizures, were more likely to need intubation. In the multivariate model, dialysis, ORâ¯=â¯4.9 (2.6,9.4, pâ¯<â¯0.0001), and AMS, ORâ¯=â¯8.8 (3.9,21.2, pâ¯<â¯0.0001), were the only independent predictors of intubation. Neurological complaints at presentation and during the hospital stay are associated with a higher risk of death, prolonged hospital stay, and intubation. More work is needed to determine whether the cause of the neurological complaints was direct CNS involvement by the virus or the other systemic complications of the virus.","Chachkhiani, David; Soliman, Michael Y; Barua, Delphi; Isakadze, Marine; Villemarette-Pittman, Nicole R; Devier, Deidre J; Lovera, Jesus F",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,614
484900,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on chronic diseases care follow-up and current perspectives in low resource settings: a narrative review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2-6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. WHERE NEXT?: Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.","Ellul, Mark A; Benjamin, Laura; Singh, Bhagteshwar; Lant, Suzannah; Michael, Benedict Daniel; Easton, Ava; Kneen, Rachel; Defres, Sylviane; Sejvar, Jim; Solomon, Tom",Lancet Neurol,,614
485084,"Associations Between Fear of COVID-19, Affective Symptoms and Risk Perception Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults During a COVID-19 Lockdown",2021,"BACKGROUND: The topic of prognosis in COVID-19 research may be important in adopting appropriate clinical decisions. Multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) is a frailty assessment tool widely used for stratifying prognosis in older people, but data regarding inpatients, affected by COVID-19, are not available. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether MPI can predict in-hospital mortality and the admission to intensive care unit (ICU) in older inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this longitudinal, Italian, multi-center study, older patients with COVID-19 were included. MPI was calculated using eight different domains typical of comprehensive geriatric assessment and categorized in three groups (MPI 1 &#8804; 0.33, MPI 2 0.34-0.66, MPI 3 > 0.66). A multivariable Cox's regression analysis was used reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: 227 older patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (mean age: 80.5 years, 59% females). Inpatients in the MPI 3 were subjected less frequently than those in the MPI 1 to non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In the multivariable analysis, people in MPI 3 experienced a higher risk of in hospital mortality (HR = 6.30, 95%CI: 1.44-27.61), compared to MPI 1. The accuracy of MPI in predicting in hospital mortality was good (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.68-0.83). People in MPI 3 experienced a significant longer length of stay (LOS) in hospital compared to other participants. No association between MPI and ICU admission was found. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty- as assessed by high MPI score - was associated with a significant higher risk of in-hospital mortality, longer LOS, and lower use NIV, whilst the association with ICU admission was not significant. These findings suggest that prognostic stratification by using the MPI could be useful in clinical decision making in older inpatients affected by COVID-19.","Pilotto, Alberto; Azzini, Margherita; Cella, Alberto; Cenderello, Giovanni; Castagna, Alberto; Pilotto, Andrea; Custureri, Romina; Dini, Simone; Farinella, Sara Tita; Ruotolo, Giovanni; Padovani, Alessandro; Custodero, Carlo; Veronese, Nicola",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,614

RESULTS: Twenty-five PAPR hoods were swabbed; 10 (40%) returned positive results. Bacterial growth was detected on six PAPR; five of the PAPR tested positive for fungal growth; all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and common respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria and fungi can remain on internal components of PAPR hoods and air supply hoses despite following recommended disinfection procedures. PAPR hoods have the potential to act as fomites, cross-infecting wearers, and patients.

MSDs included osteoarthritis, neck pain, lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and others, while pain medication included paracetamol, gabapentin, pregabalin, glucocorticoid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids (strong and weak opioids), and benzodiazepine. Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. A total of 7713 patients with COVID-19 were included, and in-hospital mortality was observed in 248 (3.2%) patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, no MSDs (p > 0.05) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. However, in-hospital mortality was 12.73 times higher in users of strong opioids (odds ratio: 12.73, 95% confidence interval: 2.44-16.64; p = 0.002), while use of paracetamol (p = 0.973), gabapentin or pregabalin (p = 0.424), glucocorticoid (p = 0.673), NSAIDs (p = 0.979), weak opioids (p = 0.876), and benzodiazepine (p = 0.324) was not associated with in-hospital mortality.

We analyzed the impact of this triage plan on the only academic neurosurgery center in San Diego County, California, USA. METHODS: We conducted a de-identified retrospective review of all operative cases and procedures performed by the Department of Neurosurgery from November 24, 2019, through July 6, 2020, a 226-day period. Statistical analysis involved 2-sample z tests assessing daily case totals over the 113-day periods before and after implementation of the OR triage plan on March 16, 2020. RESULTS: The neurosurgical service performed 1429 surgical and interventional radiologic procedures over the study period. There was no statistically significant difference in mean number of daily total cases in the pre-versus post-OR triage plan periods (6.9 vs. 5.8 mean daily cases; 1-tail P = 0.050, 2-tail P = 0.101), a trend reflected by nearly every category of neurosurgical cases.

This study examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on high school students shortly after closure of public schools in spring 2020, and whether this impact varies by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and grade level. METHODS: A cross-sectional, one-time online survey was completed by racial/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse students in 9th through 12th grade at 2 semi-rural Georgia public high schools (N = 761). RESULTS: Overall, almost one-fourth of high school students were extremely or very worried about the pandemic, with higher rates of worry among students who are racial/ethnic minorities, lower SES, female and in older grades. Results indicated a concerning impact on the stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness that students are feeling, particularly among girls and those in older grades. Students of color and low SES, who are already disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, are also more likely to experience mental health challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight important demographic differences of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of high school students and have implications for schools with addressing these needs.","Gazmararian, J.; Weingart, R.; Campbell, K.; Cronin, T.; Ashta, J.",Journal of School Health,,614

As much as the researchers are inundated for the quest of effective treatments from available drugs, the discovery and trials of new experimental drugs are also at a threshold for clinical trials. There has been much concern regarding the new and targeted drugs considering the comprehensive ambiguity regarding the mechanism and pathway of the drug action with respect to the new and unpredictable structural and nonstructural proteins (NSPs) of SARS CoV-2. This study was aimed to discuss functional pathways related to NSPs in CoVs with updated knowledge regarding SARS CoV-2, mechanisms of action of certain approved and investigational drugs for correct orientation regarding the treatment strategies, including nucleotide analog mechanism, receptor analog mechanism, and peptide-peptide interactions, along with the impact of COVID-19 on a global scale. Although there is a dire need for targeted drugs against SARS CoV-2, the practical achievement of its cure is possible by only using effective drugs with appropriate mechanisms to eliminate the disease.","Sadia, Aatika; Basra, Muhammad Asim Raza",Drug dev. res,,614

In a four-month period (January–May, 2020), video visits across the system increased more than 1,000-fold (from approximately 80 to 80,000 per month). For vulnerable populations, telehealth may reduce or exacerbate disparities in access to and quality of care. To enhance equity in telehealth access, we must assess, in the moment, how system-wide digital health strategies affect vulnerable populations. In this commentary, we describe how we are developing a telehealth equity dashboard and our plans to apply the data for system-wide improvement in telehealth access. We describe key elements of this process including the composition of the team involved in dashboard creation, how a telehealth impact assessment tool can be used to determine which measures to track, and how dashboard data will inform action across the system to advance equity in telehealth.","Hughes, Helen K.; Hasselfeld, Brian W.; Cooper, Lisa A.; Thornton, Rachel L.

492078,Mitigating ethnic disparities in covid-19 and beyond,2021,"We estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on the United Kingdom economy, including direct disease effects, preventive public actions and associated policies. A sectoral, whole-economy macroeconomic model was linked to a population-wide epidemiological demographic model to assess the potential macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, together with policies to mitigate or suppress the pandemic by means of home quarantine, school closures, social distancing and accompanying business closures. Our simulations indicate that, assuming a clinical attack rate of 48% and a case fatality ratio of 1.5%, COVID-19 alone would impose a direct health-related economic burden of £39.6bn (1.73% of GDP) on the UK economy. Mitigation strategies imposed for 12 weeks reduce case fatalities by 29%, but the total cost to the economy is £308bn (13.5% of GDP); £66bn (2.9% of GDP) of which is attributable to labour lost from working parents during school closures, and £201bn (8.8% of GDP) of which is attributable to business closures. Suppressing the pandemic over a longer period of time may reduce deaths by 95%, but the total cost to the UK economy also increases to £668bn (29.2% of GDP), where £166bn (7.3% of GDP) is attributable to school closures and 502bn (21.9% of GDP) to business closures. Our analyses suggest Covid-19 has the potential to impose unprecedented economic costs on the UK economy, and whilst public actions are necessary to minimise mortality, the duration of school and business closures are key to determining the economic cost. The initial economic support package promised by the UK government may be proportionate to the costs of mitigating Covid-19, but without alternative measures to reduce the scale and duration of school and business closures, the economic support may be insufficient to compensate for longer term suppression of the pandemic which could generate an even greater health impact through major recession.","Keogh-Brown, Marcus R; Jensen, Henning Tarp; Edmunds, W John; Smith, Richard D",SSM Popul Health,,614

493934,Organ Shortage: Major or Minor Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cruise travel contributed to SARS-CoV-2 transmission when there were relatively few cases in the United States. By March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order suspending U.S. cruise operations; the last U.S. passenger ship docked on April 16. METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises in U.S. waters or carrying U.S. citizens and used regression models to compare voyage characteristics. We used compartmental models to simulate the potential impact of four interventions (screening for COVID-19 symptoms; viral testing on two days and isolation of positive persons; reduction of passengers by 40%, crew by 20%, and port visits to one) for 7-day and 14-day voyages. RESULTS: During January 19-April 16, 2020, 89 voyages on 70 ships had known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks; 16 ships had recurrent outbreaks. There were 1,669 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. Longer voyages were associated with more cases (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, p < 0.0001). Mathematical models showed that 7-day voyages had about 70% fewer cases than 14-day voyages. On 7-day voyages, the most effective interventions were reducing the number of individuals onboard (43-49% reduction in total infections) and testing passengers and crew (42-43% reduction in total infections). All four interventions reduced transmission by 80%, but no single intervention or combination eliminated transmission. Results were similar for 14-day voyages. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises were common during January-April 2020. Despite all interventions modeled, cruise travel still poses a significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.","Guagliardo, Sarah Anne J; Prasad, Pragati V; Rodriguez, Andrea; Fukunaga, Rena; Novak, Ryan T; Ahart, Lauren; Reynolds, Jared; Griffin, Isabel; Wiegand, Ryan; Quilter, Laura A S; Morrison, Stephanie; Jenkins, Keisha; Wall, Hilary K; Treffiletti, Aimee; White, Stefanie B; Regan, Joanna; Tardivel, Kara; Freeland, Amy; Brown, Clive; Wolford, Hannah; Johansson, Michael A; Cetron, Martin S; Slayton, Rachel B; Friedman, Cindy R",Clin. infect. dis,,614

The random Effect model has been used to check for robustness. Three variables, namely, Return on Asset (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Net Interest Margin (NIM), have been used as profitability proxies. Non-interest income, capital ratio, and GDP growth have been found to have a significant relationship with ROA. In addition to non-interest income, market share, bank size, and real exchange rates are significant explaining variables if profitability is measured as NIM. The only significant determinant of profitability measured by ROE is market share. The primary contribution of this study to the existing knowledge base is an extensive empirical analysis by covering the entire gamut of independent variables (bank specific, industry related, and macroeconomic) to explain the profitability of the banks in Bangladesh. It also covers an extensive and recent data set. Banking sector stakeholders may find great value from the outputs of this paper. Regulators and policymakers may find this useful in undertaking analyses in setting policy rates, banking industry stability, and impact assessment of critical policy measures before and after the enactment, etc. Investors and the bank management are to use the findings of this paper in analyzing the real drivers of profitability of the banks they are contemplating to invest and managing on a daily basis.","Hossain, Md Saimum; Ahamed, Faruque",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14198v2.pdf,614

METHODS: This case-control study included newborns diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China from January 2020 to July 2020. All included newborns had complete neurological evaluations and head magnetic resonance imaging. We normalized the extracted T2-weighted imaging data to a standard neonate template space, and segmented them into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The comparison of gray matter volume was conducted between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of five neonates with COVID-19 were included in this study. The median reflex scores were 2 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0094), and the median orientation and behavior scores were 2.5 points lower in the infected group than in the control group (P = 0.0008). There were also significant differences between the two groups in the total scale score (P = 0.0426). The caudate nucleus, parahippocampal gyrus, and thalamus had the strongest correlations with the Hammersmith neonatal neurologic examination (HNNE) score, and the absolute correlation coefficients between the gray matter volumes and each part of the HNNE score were all almost greater than 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: We first compared the neurological performance of neonates with and without COVID-19 by quantitative neuroimaging and neurological examination methods. Considering the limited numbers of patients, more studies focusing on the structural or functional aspects of the virus in the central nervous system in different age groups will be carried out in the future.","Yan, Kai; Xiao, Fei-Fan; Jiang, Yu-Wei; Xiao, Tian-Tian; Zhang, Da-Jiang; Yuan, Wen-Hao; Shao, Jian-Bo; Cheng, Guo-Qiang; Zeng, Ling-Kong",World J Pediatr,,614

Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the first phase of lockdown (March 15-April 25, 2020) relative to a pre-lockdown reference period and historical baselines established in 2017-2019. The reductions, up to 49% for NO2 and 37% for CO, are statistically significant at two thirds of the sites and tend to increase with local population density. Significant reductions of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) only occurred in the Northeast and California/Nevada metropolises where NO2 declined the most, while the changes in ozone (O3) were mixed and relatively minor. These findings are consistent with lower transportation and utility demands that dominate NO2 and CO emissions, especially in major urban areas, due to the lockdown. This study provides an insight into potential public health benefits with more aggressive air quality management, which should be factored into strategies to reopen the U.S. and global economy.","Chen, L-W Antony; Chien, Lung-Chang; Li, Yi; Lin, Ge",Sci Total Environ,,614

We report a case of a 71-year-old woman who presented with diplopia developing from abducens nerve palsy after C1-C2 fixation and fusion due to atlantoaxial subluxation with cord compression. As soon as we discovered the symptoms, we suspected excessive traction by the instrument and subsequently performed reoperation. Subsequently, the patient's symptoms improved. In other reported cases we reviewed, most were transient. However, we thought that our rapid response also helped the patient's fast recovery in this case. The mechanisms by which postoperative diplopia develops vary and, thus, remain unclear. We should pay attention to the fact that the condition is sometimes an indicator of an underlying, life-threatening condition. Therefore, all patients with postoperative diplopia should undergo thorough ophthalmological and neurological evaluations as well as careful observation by a multidisciplinary team.","Kim, Ji-Yoon; Kim, Hyuna; Kang, So Jeong; Kim, Hyunjee; Lee, Young-Seok",,,614

We aim to describe the incidence, associated variables, and outcomes of rhabdomyolysis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for all critically ill adult patients (&#8805;18 years old) admitted to the ICU at a large academic medical center with confirmed COVID-19 between March 13, 2020 and April 18, 2020 were prospectively collected. Patients with serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations greater than 1000 U/L were diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Patients were further stratified as having moderate (serum CK concentration 1000-4999 U/L) or severe (serum CK concentration &#8805;5000 U/L) rhabdomyolysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify outcomes and variables associated with the development of rhabdomyolysis. RESULTS: Of 235 critically ill COVID-19 patients, 114 (48.5%) met diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis. Patients with rhabdomyolysis more often required mechanical ventilation (P < 0.001), prone positioning (P < 0.001), pharmacological paralysis (P < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (P = 0.010), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (P = 0.025). They also had longer median ICU length of stay (LOS) (P < 0.001) and hospital LOS (P < 0.001). No difference in mortality was observed. Male sex, patients with morbid obesity, SOFA score, and prone positioning were independently associated with rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of critically ill COVID-19 patients in our cohort met diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis. Male sex, morbid obesity, SOFA score, and prone position were independently associated with rhabdomyolysis.

Despite early identification of ACE2 as the receptor for viral spike protein, much remains to be understood about the molecular events behind viral dissemination. We evaluated the contribution of C-type lectin receptors (CLRS) of antigen-presenting cells, widely present in respiratory mucosa and lung tissue. DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, Langerin and MGL bind to diverse glycans of the spike using multiple interaction areas. Using pseudovirus and cells derived from monocytes or T-lymphocytes, we demonstrate that while virus capture by the CLRs examined does not allow direct cell infection, DC/L-SIGN, among these receptors, promote virus transfer to permissive ACE2+ Vero E6 cells. A glycomimetic compound designed against DC-SIGN, enable inhibition of this process. These data have been then confirmed using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and human respiratory cell lines. Thus, we described a mechanism potentiating viral spreading of infection.","Thépaut, Michel; Luczkowiak, Joanna; Vivès, Corinne; Labiod, Nuria; Bally, Isabelle; Lasala, Fátima; Grimoire, Yasmina; Fenel, Daphna; Sattin, Sara; Thielens, Nicole; Schoehn, Guy; Bernardi, Anna; Delgado, Rafael; Fieschi, Franck",PLoS Pathog,,614

However, to achieve rapid drug targeting in vivo the ion-pair must be protected against breakdown before the entry into the target tissue. This study aims to investigate if inserting theophylline, when ion-paired to the polyamine transporter substrate spermine, into a cyclodextrin (CD), to form a triplex, could direct the bronchodilator to the lungs selectively after intravenous administration. NMR demonstrates that upon the formation of the triplex spermine protruded from the CD cavity and this results in energy-dependent uptake in A549 cells (1.8-fold enhancement), which persists for more than 20 min. In vivo, the triplex produces a 2.4-fold and 2.2-fold increase in theophylline in the lungs 20 min after injection in rats and mice, respectively (p < 0.05). The lung targeting is selective with no increase in uptake into the brain or the heart where the side-effects of theophylline are treatment-limiting. Selectively doubling the concentration of theophylline in the lungs could improve the benefit-risk ratio of this narrow therapeutic index medicine, which continues to be important in critical care.","Sofian, Zarif M; Benaouda, Faiza; Wang, Julie Tzu-Wen; Lu, Yuan; Barlow, David J; Royall, Paul G; Farag, Doaa B; Rahman, Khondaker Miraz; Al-Jamal, Khuloud T; Forbes, Ben; Jones, Stuart A",Adv Ther (Weinh),,614

Currently, the absence of any effective antiviral treatment is the major concern for the global population. The reports of the occurrence of various point mutations within the important therapeutic target protein of SARS-CoV-2 has elevated the problem. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a major therapeutic target for new antiviral designs. In this study, the efficacy of PF-00835231 was investigated (a Mpro inhibitor under clinical trials) against the Mpro and their reported mutants. Various in silico approaches were used to investigate and compare the efficacy of PF-00835231 and five drugs previously documented to inhibit the Mpro.

To understand the evolution of this virus in humans, and to assist in tracing infection pathways and designing preventive strategies, we present a set of computational tools that span phylogenomics, population genetics and machine learning approaches. To illustrate the utility of this toolbox, we detail an in depth analysis of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, using 329,854 high-quality consensus sequences published in the GISAID database during the pre-vaccination phase. We demonstrate that, compared to standard phylogenetic approaches, haplotype networks can be computed efficiently on much larger datasets, enabling real-time analyses. Furthermore, time series change of Tajimas D provides a powerful metric of population expansion. Unsupervised learning techniques further highlight key steps in variant detection and facilitate the study of the role of this genomic variation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Multiscale PHATE methodology identifying fine-scale structure in the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that underlies the emergence of key lineages.

501768,Psychopathology in Elderly COVID-19 Survivors and Controls,2021,"More than 130,000 peer-reviewed studies have been published within one year after COVID-19 emerged in many countries. This large and rapidly growing field may overwhelm the synthesizing abilities of both researchers and policy-makers. To provide a sinopsis, prevent errors, and detect cognitive gaps that may require interdisciplinary research methods, the literature on COVID-19 is summarized, twice. The overall purpose of this study is to generate a dialogue meant to explain the genesis of and/or find remedies for omissions and contradictions. The first review starts in Biology and ends in Policy. Policy is chosen as a destination because it is the setting where cognitive integration must occur. The second review follows the opposite path: it begins with stated policies on COVID-19 and then their assumptions and disciplinary relationships are identified. The purpose of this interdisciplinary method on methods is to yield a relational and explanatory view of the field -one strategy likely to be incomplete but usable when large bodies of literature need to be rapidly summarized. These reviews identify nine inter-related problems, research needs, or omissions, namely: (1) nation-wide, geo-referenced, epidemiological data collection systems (open to and monitored by the public); (2) metrics meant to detect non-symptomatic cases -e.g., test positivity-; (3) cost-benefit oriented methods, which should demonstrate they detect silent viral spreaders even with limited testing; (4) new personalized tests that inform on biological functions and disease correlates, such as cell-mediated immunity, co-morbidities, and immuno-suppression; (5) factors that influence vaccine effectiveness; (6) economic predictions that consider the long-term consequences likely to follow epidemics that growth exponentially; (7) the errors induced by self-limiting and/or implausible paradigms, such as binary and reductionist approaches; (8) new governance models that emphasize problem-solving skills, social participation, and the use of scientific knowledge; and (9) new educational programs that utilize visual aids and audience-specific communication strategies. The analysis indicates that, to optimally address these problems, disciplinary and social integration is needed. By asking what is/are the potential cause(s) and consequence(s) of each issue, this methodology generates visualizations that reveal possible relationships as well as omissions and contradictions. While inherently limited in scope and likely to become obsolete, these shortcomings are avoided when this 'method on methods' is frequently practiced. Open-ended, inter-/trans-disciplinary perspectives and broad social participation may help researchers and citizens to construct, de-construct, and re-construct COVID-19 related research.","Rivas, Ariel L; van Regenmortel, Marc H V",Methods (S.

The analysis of variance results showed that the selected quadratic model with interaction (R2 = 0.9802) was statistically significant. The experimental results showed that the degradation quantity of methylene blue increased when the ts value increased and T decreased. We have evaluated the photocatalytic activity of this supported catalyst (TiO2-GP) with a laboratory reactor under natural condition; the maximum removal (96.03%) was obtained at ts = 331 min, T = 559 °C and (TiO2) = 2.38 g/l.

Physiotherapists' perceptions and willingness are two key factors that influence the provision of remote physiotherapy. AIM: To investigate physiotherapists' perceptions of and willingness to use telerehabilitation in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the barriers that may hinder the use of telerehabilitation in this sector. METHODS: The following methods were used: (1) a cross-sectional survey and (2) face-to-face semi-structured interviews. In the cross-sectional survey, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 747 physiotherapists who were working in the governmental health sector. The questionnaire included four sections: perceptions of telerehabilitation, comfort with technology, willingness to use telerehabilitation, and barriers to using telerehabilitation. Six interviews were conducted with physiotherapy managers to explore the barriers and facilitators of telerehabilitation practice. DATA ANALYSIS: In this study, descriptive data analysis was conducted, and a cross-tabulation technique was used to find the associations between the variables, in which chi-square tests were used to identify the significance of the results, where p < 0.05. Thematic content analysis was used for the interviews. RESULTS: Only 273 completed questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 36.5%. Most of the respondents (237; 86.8%) considered telerehabilitation a viable option to deliver healthcare to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) (156; 57.1%), 89% (243) of the respondents were willing to integrate telerehabilitation into their conventional practice, as cultural and social norms were not against the use of telerehabilitation systems. The results indicate that the more the physiotherapists used the internet and email in their work and the more comfortable they were with technology, the more willing they were to use telerehabilitation systems (p = 0.01). The physiotherapy managers reported that patients' privacy and the confidentiality of their data were considered barriers. CONCLUSION: In Kuwait, physiotherapists show overall positive perceptions towards and a willingness to use telerehabilitation to facilitate patients' access to physiotherapy services. There are several barriers to employing telerehabilitation. Accordingly, recommendations are suggested.","Albahrouh, Sarah Ibraheem; Buabbas, Ali Jasem",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,614

Reply to Smith and Saxena Commentaries",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Despite improvements in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV outcomes, there remain unacceptably high numbers of mother-to-child transmissions (MTCT) of HIV. Programmes and research collect multiple sources of PMTCT data, yet this data is rarely integrated in a systematic way. We conducted a data integration exercise to evaluate the Zimbabwe national PMTCT programme and derive lessons for strengthening implementation and documentation. METHODS: We used data from four sources: research, Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) programme, Implementer - Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development, and modelling. Research data came from serial population representative cross-sectional surveys that evaluated the national PMTCT programme in 2012, 2014 and 2017/2018. MOHCC and Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development collected data with similar indicators for the period 2018 to 2019. Modelling data from 2017/18 UNAIDS Spectrum was used. We systematically integrated data from the different sources to explore PMTCT programme performance at each step of the cascade. We also conducted spatial analysis to identify hotspots of MTCT. RESULTS: We developed cascades for HIV-positive and negative-mothers, and HIV exposed and infected infants to 24 months post-partum. Most data were available on HIV positive mothers. Few data were available 6-8 weeks post-delivery for HIV exposed/infected infants and none were available post-delivery for HIV-negative mothers. The different data sources largely concurred. Antenatal care (ANC) registration was high, although women often presented late. There was variable implementation of PMTCT services, MTCT hotspots were identified. Factors positively associated with MTCT included delayed ANC registration and mobility (use of more than one health facility) during pregnancy/breastfeeding. There was reduced MTCT among women whose partners accompanied them to ANC, and infants receiving antiretroviral prophylaxis. Notably, the largest contribution to MTCT was from postnatal women who had previously tested negative (12/25 in survey data, 17.6% estimated by Spectrum modelling). Data integration enabled formulation of interventions to improve programmes. CONCLUSIONS: Data integration was feasible and identified gaps in programme implementation/documentation leading to corrective interventions. Incident infections among mothers are the largest contributors to MTCT: there is need to strengthen the prevention cascade among HIV-negative women.","Sibanda, Euphemia L; Webb, Karen; Fahey, Carolyn A; Kang Dufour, Mi-Suk; McCoy, Sandra I; Watadzaushe, Constancia; Dirawo, Jeffrey; Deda, Marsha; Chimwaza, Anesu; Taramusi, Isaac; Mushavi, Angela; Mukungunugwa, Solomon; Padian, Nancy; Cowan, Frances M",J Int AIDS Soc,,614

503795,"Thoughts about ""other"" patients' rights during COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"Despite the pandemic status of COVID-19, there is limited information about host risk factors and treatment beyond supportive care. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) could be a potential treatment target. Our aim was to determine the incidence of IgG deficiency and associated risk factors in a cohort of 62 critical ill COVID-19 patients admitted to two German ICUs (72.6% male, median age: 61 years). 13 (21.0%) of the patients displayed IgG deficiency (IgG <7 g/L) at baseline (predominant for the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses). IgG-deficient patients had worse measures of clinical disease severity than those with normal IgG levels (shorter duration from disease onset to ICU admission, lower ratio of PaO2 to FiO2, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and higher levels of ferritin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and serum creatinine). IgG-deficient patients were also more likely to have sustained lower levels of lymphocyte counts and higher levels of ferritin throughout the hospital stay. Furthermore, IgG-deficient patients compared to those with normal IgG levels displayed higher rates of acute kidney injury (76.9% vs. 26.5%; p=0.005) and death (46.2% vs. 14.3%; p=0.012), longer ICU (28 [6-48] vs. 12 [3-18] days; p=0.012) and hospital length of stay (30 [22-50] vs. 18 [9-24] days; p=0.004). Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing odds of 90-day overall mortality associated with IgG-deficiency (OR 12.8, 95% CI 1.5-108.4; p=0.019). IgG deficiency might be common in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and warrants investigation as both a marker of disease severity as well as a potential therapeutic target.","Husain-Syed, Faeq; Vadász, István; Wilhelm, Jochen; Walmrath, Hans-Dieter; Seeger, Werner; Birk, Horst-Walter; Jennert, Birgit; Dietrich, Hartmut; Herold, Susanne; Trauth, Janina; Tello, Khodr; Sander, Michael; Morty, Rory E; Slanina, Heiko; Schüttler, Christian G; Ziebuhr, John; Kassoumeh, Shadi; Ronco, Claudio; Ferrari, Fiorenza; Warnatz, Klaus; Stahl, Klaus; Seeliger, Benjamin; Hoeper, Marius M; Welte, Tobias; David, Sascha","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,614
503859,Rates of Hospital-acquired Clostridioides Infection during the Covid-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Healthcare Setting,2021,"SARS‐CoV‐2 is the causative agent of COVID‐19. Severe COVID‐19 disease has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombosis, but the mechanisms underlying COVID‐19‐related coagulopathy remain unknown. The risk of severe COVID‐19 disease is higher in males than in females and increases with age. To identify gene products that may contribute to COVID‐19‐related coagulopathy, we analyzed the expression of genes associated with the Gene Ontology (GO) term “blood coagulation” in the Genotype‐Tissue Expression (GTEx) database and identified four procoagulants, whose expression is higher in males and increases with age (ADAMTS13, F11, HGFAC, KLKB1), and two anticoagulants, whose expression is higher in females and decreases with age (C1QTNF1, SERPINA5). However, the expression of none of these genes was regulated in a proteomics dataset of SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected cells and none of the proteins have been identified as a binding partner of SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins. Hence, they may rather generally predispose individuals to thrombosis without directly contributing to COVID‐19‐related coagulopathy. In contrast, the expression of the procoagulant transferrin (not associated to the GO term “blood coagulation”) was higher in males, increased with age, and was upregulated upon SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Hence, transferrin warrants further examination in ongoing clinic-pathological investigations.","McLaughlin, Katie-May; Bechtel, Marco; Bojkova, Denisa; Münch, Christian; Ciesek, Sandra; Wass, Mark N.; Michaelis, Martin; Cinatl, Jindrich",Diagn.,,614

503955,Nature contact and children's health: A systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis between novel coronavirus pneumonia patients (NCPP) and influenza patients (IP) remains a challenge in clinical practice. METHODS: Between January 2018 and March 2020, 1,027 NCPP and 1,140 IP were recruited from Tongji hospital. Routine blood examination, biochemical indicators and coagulation function analysis were simultaneously performed in all participants. RESULTS: There was no sex predominance in NCPP. The NCPP were frequently encountered in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The mean age of NCPP (56±16 years) was higher than IP (47±17 years), but without statistical difference. Although most results of routine laboratory tests between NCPP and IP had no significant differences, some laboratory tests showed an obvious change in NCPP. It was observed that NCPP had significantly decreased white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase and d-dimer compared with IP. However, the results of lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen were significantly increased in NCPP compared with IP. The diagnostic model based on a combination of 18 routine laboratory indicators showed an area under the curve of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.777-0.814), with a sensitivity of 46.93% and specificity of 90.09% when using a cut-off value of 0.598. CONCLUSIONS: Some routine laboratory results had statistical difference between NCPP and IP. A diagnostic model based on a combination of routine laboratory results provided an adjunct approach in the differential diagnosis between NCPP and IP.","Luo, Ying; Yuan, Xu; Xue, Ying; Mao, Liyan; Lin, Qun; Tang, Guoxing; Song, Huijuan; Liu, Weiyong; Hou, Hongyan; Wang, Feng; Sun, Ziyong",Int J Infect Dis,,614

Factors related to smell and taste disorders were analysed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 126 patients, 63 women and 63 men, aged 16-80 years, were included. As many as 69 patients (62.7%) presented hyposmia, and 58 (46%) of them had anosmia. A total of 75 patients (59.5%) presented hypogeusia, and 57 (45.2%) of them had ageusia. The risk factors that were most commonly associated with these disorders were the female sex (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 2.43 for smell disorders and 2.44 for taste disorders), allergic rhinitis (aOR 3.34 for smell disorders) and a younger age. A protective factor was arterial hypertension (aOR 0.51 for smell disorders and 0.35 for taste disorders). A history of tonsillectomy was the risk factor for taste disorder (aOR 5.23). &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Our results indicate that these sensory disorders occurred more frequently in female patients and in young patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who progressed with mild nasal congestion, posterior rhinorrhoea and without anterior rhinorrhoea. The recovery of taste occurred before the recovery of smell.","Guillén Martínez, Alberto; Andreu Gálvez, Marina; Rodríguez Sanz, Sara; Hernández Ruiz, Paula; García Morillas, Antonio; Esteban Sánchez, Tomás",Otolaryngol Pol,,614

The droplets were found to evaporate within a short timeframe, which is consistent with previous reports concerning the drying kinetics of picolitre droplets. Using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we found that the surface deposited microdroplet nuclei present two distinctive morphological features as the result of their drying mode, which is controlled by both interfacial energy and surface roughness. Nanomechanical measurements confirm that the nuclei deposited on all substrates possess similar surface adhesion and Youngs modulus, supporting the proposed coreshell structure of the nuclei. We suggest that appropriate antiviral surface strategies, e.g. functionalisation, chemical deposition, could be developed to modulate the evaporation process of microdroplet nuclei, and subsequently mitigate the possible surface viability and transmissibility of respiratory virus.","Kosmidis-Papadimitriou, Alexandros; Qi, Shaojun; Squillace, Ophelie; Rosik, Nicole; Bale, Mark; Fryer, Peter J.; Zhang, Zhenyu J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10024v1.pdf,614

509510,Now is the time: a call for increased access to contraception and safe abortion care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of a priori non-symptomatic but infectious humans (either by random or cohort testing) significantly improves the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared to intervention strategies relying on data from symptomatic cases only. This is because such sampling measures the incidence of the disease, the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and thus anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. The frequent testing of non-symptomatic infectiousness will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. These advantages are quantified by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feedback is derived from the evolution of the daily measured prevalence. While the basic model we propose aggregates data for the entire population of a country such as Switzerland, we point out generalizations which account for hot spots which are analogous to Anderson-localized regions in the theory of diffusion in random media.","Müller, Markus; Derlet, Peter M; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel",Phys Biol,,614

Here, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and immunological data from 18 fatal COVID-19 cases, results showed that these patients had severe lymphocytopenia, together with high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10), and elevation of many other mediators in routine laboratory tests, including C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and natriuretic peptide type B. The spleens and hilar lymph nodes (LNs) from six additional COVID-19 patients with post-mortem examinations were also collected, histopathologic detection showed that both organs manifested severe tissue damage and lymphocyte apoptosis in these six cases. In situ hybridization assays illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA accumulates in these tissues, and transmission electronic microscopy confirmed that coronavirus-like particles were visible in the LNs. SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid protein (NP) accumulated in the spleens and LNs, and the NP antigen restricted in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 triggered the transcription of Il6, Il8 and Il1b genes in infected primary macrophages and DCs in vitro, and SARS-CoV-2-NP+ macrophages and DCs also manifested high levels of IL-6 and IL-1ß, which might directly decimate human spleens and LNs and subsequently lead to lymphocytopenia in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 induced lymphocytopenia by promoting systemic inflammation and direct neutralization in human spleen and LNs.","Xiang, Qun; Feng, Zeqing; Diao, Bo; Tu, Chao; Qiao, Qinghua; Yang, Han; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Gang; Wang, Huiming; Wang, Chenhui; Liu, Liang; Wang, Changsong; Liu, Longding; Chen, Rong; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Front Immunol,,614

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 national lockdown (March 9, 2020) on the quality of care provided to patients with hip fracture (HF) in Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna, 2 large regions of northern Italy severely hit by the pandemic. MethodsWe calculated the percentage of HF patients undergoing surgery within 2 days of hospital admission. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed on weekly data from December 11, 2019 to June 9, 2020 ({approx}6 months), interrupting the series in the 2nd week of March. The same data observed the year before were included as a control time series with no ""intervention"" (lockdown) in the middle of the observation period. ResultsBefore the lockdown, 2-day surgery was 69.9% in Piedmont and 79.2% in Emilia-Romagna; after the lockdown, these proportions were equal to 69.8% (-0.1%) and 69.3% (- 9.9%), respectively. While Piedmont did not experience any drop in the amount of surgery, Emilia-Romagna exhibited a significantly decline at a weekly rate of -1.29% (95% CI = -1.71 to -0.88). Divergent trend patterns in the 2 study regions reflect local differences in pandemic timing as well as in healthcare services capacity, management, and emergency preparedness.","Golinelli, Davide; Lenzi, Jacopo; Adorno, Emanuele; Gianino, Maria Michela; Fantini, Maria Pia",,,614

514277,The effects of COVID-19 pandemic in volleyball players and sports clubs in Greece,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To report our institutional experience in devising and implementing a pooling protocol and process for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing over a 3-month period in the fall of 2020. METHODS: The widespread testing implemented in the United States for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to a significant shortage of testing supplies and therefore has become a major impediment to the public health response. To date, several institutions have implemented sample pooling, but publications documenting these experiences are sparse. Nasal and nasopharyngeal samples collected from low-positivity (<5%) areas were tested in pools of five on the Roche cobas 6800 analyzer system. Routine SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR turnaround times between sample collection to result reporting were monitored and compared before and after sample pooling implementation. RESULTS: A total of 4,131 sample pools were tested over a 3-month period (during which 39,770 RT-PCR results were reported from the Roche system), allowing our laboratory to save 13,824 tests, equivalent to a conservation rate of 35%. A 48-hour or less turnaround time was generally maintained throughout the pooling period. CONCLUSIONS: Sample pooling offers a viable means to mitigate shortfalls of PCR testing supplies in the ongoing pandemic without significantly compromising overall turnaround times.","Chan, Clarence W; Kwon, Seunghyug; Matushek, Scott M; Ciaglia, Carol; Bethel, Cindy; Beavis, Kathleen G",Am J Clin Pathol,,614

METHODS: We conducted a diagnostic accuracy study where subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 401) and healthy volunteers (n = 100) were asked to self-swab from their oropharynx and mid-turbinate (OPMT), and self-collect saliva. The results of these samples were compared to an OPMT performed by a HCW in the same patient at the same session. RESULTS: In subjects confirmed to have COVID-19, the sensitivities of the HCW-swab, self-swab, saliva, and combined self-swab plus saliva samples were 82.8%, 75.1%, 74.3% and 86.5% respectively. All samples obtained from healthy volunteers were tested negative. Compared to HCW-swab, the sensitivities of a self-swab sample and saliva sample were inferior by 8.7% (95%CI: 2.4% to 15.0%, p = 0.006) and 9.5% (95%CI: 3.1% to 15.8%, p = 0.003) respectively. The combined detection rate of self-swab and saliva had a sensitivity of 2.7% (95%CI: -2.6% to 8.0%, p = 0.321). The sensitivity of both the self-collection methods are higher when the Ct value of the HCW swab is less than 30. The specificity of both the self-swab and saliva testing was 100% (95% CI 96.4% to 100%). CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that sensitivities of self-collected OPMT swab and saliva samples were inferior to a HCW swab, but they could still be useful testing tools in the appropriate clinical settings.","Tan, Seow Yen; Tey, Hong Liang; Lim, Ernest Tian Hong; Toh, Song Tar; Chan, Yiong Huak; Tan, Pei Ting; Lee, Sing Ai; Tan, Cheryl Xiaotong; Koh, Gerald Choon Huat; Tan, Thean Yen; Siau, Chuin",PLoS One,,614

Here, we explored 1962 high-quality genomes of early SARS-CoV-2 strains obtained from 42 countries before April 2020. The changing trends of genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 strains over time and country were subsequently identified. In addition, viral genotype mapping and phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify the variation features of SARS-CoV-2. Results showed that 57.89% of genetic variations involved in ORF1ab, most of which (68.85%) were nonsynonymous. Haplotype maps and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that amino acid variations in ORF1ab (p.5828P > L and p.5865Y > C, also NSP13: P504L and NSP13: Y541C) were the important characteristics of such clade. Furthermore, these variants showed more significant aggregation in the United States (P = 2.92E-66, 95%) than in Australia or Canada, especially in strains from Washington State (P = 1.56E-23, 77.65%). Further analysis demonstrated that the report date of the variants was associated with the date of increased infections and the date of recovery and fatality rate change in the United States. More importantly, the fatality rate in Washington State was higher (4.13%) and showed poorer outcomes (P = 4.12E-21 in fatality rate, P = 3.64E-29 in death and recovered cases) than found in other states containing a small proportion of strains with such variants. Using sequence alignment, we found that variations at the 504 and 541 sites had functional effects on NSP13. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2, gaining insights into amino acid variations in ORF1ab and COVID-19 outcomes.","Cao, Canhui; He, Liang; Tian, Yuan; Qin, Yu; Sun, Haiyin; Ding, Wencheng; Gui, Lingli; Wu, Peng",Infect Genet Evol,,614

In such situation, predicting as accurately as possible the future dynamics of the virus is a challenging problem for scientists and decision-makers. In this paper, four phenomenological epidemic models as well as Suspected-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model are investigated for predicting the cumulative number of infected cases in Saudi Arabia in addition to the probable end-date of the outbreak. The prediction problem is formulated as an optimization framework and solved using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The Generalized Richards Model (GRM) has been found to be the best one in achieving two objectives: first, fitting the collected data (covering 223 days between March 2nd and October 10, 2020) with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 3.2889%), the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.9953) and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE = 8827); and second, predicting a probable end date found to be around the end of December 2020 with a projected number of 378,299 at the end of the outbreak. The obtained results may help the decision-makers to take suitable decisions related to the pandemic mitigation and containment and provide clear understanding of the virus dynamics in Saudi Arabia.","Zreiq, Rafat; Kamel, Souad; Boubaker, Sahbi; Al-Shammary, Asma A; Algahtani, Fahad D; Alshammari, Fares",AIMS Public Health,,614

It is critical to find new treatments. Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 <300; and mechanical ventilation. All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Exposures: Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion. Results: All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion. Conclusions and Relevance: In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.","Shen, Chenguang; Wang, Zhaoqin; Zhao, Fang; Yang, Yang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Delin; Yang, Minghui; Xing, Li; Wei, Jinli; Xiao, Haixia; Yang, Yan; Qu, Jiuxin; Qing, Ling; Chen, Li; Xu, Zhixiang; Peng, Ling; Li, Yanjie; Zheng, Haixia; Chen, Feng; Huang, Kun; Jiang, Yujing; Liu, Dongjing; Zhang, Zheng; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei",JAMA,,614
519525,"Effects and safety of herbal medicines among community-dwelling residents during COVID-19 pandemic: A large prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT)",2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: In spring 2020, high numbers of children presented with acral pernio-like skin rashes, concurrent with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding their clinical characteristics/ infection status may provide prognostic information and facilitate decisions about management. METHODS: A pediatric-specific dermatology registry was created by the Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology (SPD) and Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) and was managed by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia using REDCap. RESULTS: Data from 378 children 0-18 years entered into the registry between April 13 and July 17, 2020 were analyzed. Data were drawn from a standardized questionnaire completed by clinicians which asked for demographics, description of acral lesions, symptoms before and after acral changes, COVID-19 positive contacts, treatment, duration of skin changes, laboratory testing including SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing, as well as histopathology. 229 (60.6%) were male with mean age of 13.0 years (± 3.6 years). Six (1.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Pedal lesions (often with pruritus and/or pain) were present in 96%. 30% (114/378) had COVID-19 symptoms during the 30 days prior to presentation. Most (69%) had no other symptoms and an uneventful course with complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children with acral pernio-like changes were healthy and all recovered with no short-term sequelae. We believe these acral changes are not just a temporal epiphenomenon of shelter in place during the spring months of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be a late phase reaction that needs further study.","Castelo-Soccio, Leslie; Lara-Corrales, Irene; Paller, Amy S; Bean, Eric; Rangu, Sneha; Oboite, Michelle; Flohr, Carsten; Ahmad, Regina-Celeste; Calberg, Valerie; Gilliam, Amy; Pope, Elena; Reynolds, Sean; Sibbald, Cathryn; Shin, Helen T; Berger, Emily; Schaffer, Julie; Siegel, Michael P; Cordoro, Kelly M",Pediatr Dermatol,,614
519596,Live-streamed ward rounds: a tool for clinical teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Test-trace-isolate programs are an essential part of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control that offer a more targeted approach than many other nonpharmaceutical interventions. Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of completeness in case detection and contact tracing and speed of isolation and quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0: 2.5, generation time: 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes in the proportion of cases detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Results from this model also indicate that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of the impact of test-trace-isolate are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history and adherence to isolation and quarantine, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the ""test"" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.","Grantz, Kyra H; Lee, Elizabeth C; D039,; Agostino McGowan, Lucy; Lee, Kyu Han; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Gurley, Emily S; Lessler, Justin",PLoS Med,,614
519711,Cuidar do Doente Reumático em Tempo de Pandemia: Muito Mais Que Apenas Medicina à Distância./ [Management of Rheumatic Diseases during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Beyond Telehealth Services],2020,"In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.","Garcia, Letícia Couto; Szabo, Judit K; de Oliveira Roque, Fabio; de Matos Martins Pereira, Alexandre; Nunes da Cunha, Catia; Damasceno-Júnior, Geraldo Alves; Morato, Ronaldo Gonçalves; Tomas, Walfrido Moraes; Libonati, Renata; Ribeiro, Danilo Bandini",J Environ Manage,,614

521008,My story in response to the stories of my patients’ experience of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: A relational psychoanalytic approach,2021,"Despite the substantial growth of telemedicine and the evidence of its advantages, the use of telemedicine in neurosurgery has been limited. Barriers have included medicolegal issues surrounding provider reimbursement, interstate licensure, and malpractice liability as well as technological challenges. Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has limited typical evaluation of patients with neurologic issues and resulted in a surge in demand for virtual medical visits. Meanwhile, federal and state governments took action to facilitate the rapid implementation of telehealth programs, placing a temporary lift on medicolegal barriers that had previously limited its expansion. This created a unique opportunity for widespread telehealth use to meet the surge in demand for remote medical care. After initial hurdles and challenges, our experience with telemedicine in neurosurgery at Penn Medicine has been overall positive from both the provider and the patients' perspective. One of the unique challenges we face is guiding patients to appropriately set up devices in a way that enables an effective neuroexamination. However, we argue that an accurate and comprehensive neurologic examination can be conducted through a telemedicine platform, despite minor weaknesses inherent to absence of physical presence. In addition, certain neurosurgical visits such as postoperative checks, vascular pathology, and brain tumors inherently lend themselves to easier evaluation through telehealth visits. In the era of COVID-19 and beyond, telemedicine remains a promising and effective approach to continue neurologic patient care.","Blue, Rachel; Yang, Andrew I; Zhou, Cecilia; De Ravin, Emma; Teng, Clare W; Arguelles, Gabriel R; Huang, Vincent; Wathen, Connor; Miranda, Stephen P; Marcotte, Paul; Malhotra, Neil R; Welch, William C; Lee, John Y K",World Neurosurg,,614
521364,Safety at the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic: How to Keep our Oncology Patients and Healthcare Workers Safe,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sedentary time poses a risk to health. Substituting physical activity for inactivity is obvious but this requires a behavior change. Interventions advocated to decrease uninterrupted physical inactivity (defined as Metabolic Equivalent of Task (METS) less than 1.5) are important. One such intervention is accomplished with the Gentle Jogger (GJ), a low risk motorized wellness device which produces effortless, rapid motion of the lower extremities simulating locomotion or fidgeting. GJ produces health benefits in type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. The purpose of this trial was to ascertain whether GJ increases METS above 1.5 to explain its effectiveness despite sedentary behavior or whether tapping is responsible. METHODS: A randomized single-arm trial was conducted. Subjects were randomized to begin the study in either the supine or seated postures and on the same day crossed over with the starting posture reversed. Oxygen consumption was measured at rest and during GJ. RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects were studied (15 women and 11 men) with a mean age of 44 ± 15 years and BMI 27.9 ± 5.0, 19 were overweight or obese, and 7 had normal BMI. GJ increased oxygen consumption and METS 15% in the seated posture and 13% in the supine posture. No individual receiving GJ achieved METS exceeding 1.5. CONCLUSIONS: In a moderately obese population, GJ in seated or supine posture did not exceed 1.5 METS. The values are comparable to those reported for sit-stand interventions and cannot explain the health benefits of GJ. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03602365 .

Needless to say, this pandemic has also had an effect on the administrations of most, if not all, the nations. This research paper seeks to draw a comparative analysis between the powers of the Executive in India and the United States of America during this pandemic. As we know, India follows a Parliamentary form of governance where the Prime Minister is the Head of the Government and a system of collective leadership is followed, whereas the USA follows a Presidential form of governance where the President is the Head of the State and the principle of individual leadership is followed. A comparative analysis of the two States’ powers of the Executive will enable an enhanced comprehension by highlighting important details about pandemic related legislations like the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, 2006 (USA) and the Epidemic Act of India, 1897;and help making abstract ideas more concrete. In this research paper, using the doctrinal method of research, we will analyse the background of the pandemic via medical papers and WHO mandates, and further delve into the executive powers of both, India and the USA during a pandemic by analysing constitutional provisions like that of the 10th Amendment of the Constitution of the USA and the Emergency Provisions under Articles 352 to 360 of the Indian Constitution and different legislations.

522100,Pediatric Faculty and Trainee Attitudes Toward the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"COVID-19, a disease induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2), has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. Though extensive research works have been reported in recent days on the development of effective therapeutics against this global health crisis, there is still no approved therapy against SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, plant-synthesized secondary metabolites (PSMs) have been prioritized to make a review focusing on the efficacy of plant-originated therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. Plant metabolites are a source of countless medicinal compounds, while the diversity of multidimensional chemical structures has made them superior to treat serious diseases. Some have already been reported as promising alternative medicines and lead compounds for drug repurposing and discovery. The versatility of secondary metabolites may provide novel antibiotics to tackle MDR (Multi-Drug Resistant) microbes too. This review attempted to find out plant metabolites that have the therapeutic potential to treat a wide range of viral pathogens. The study includes the search of remedies belonging to plant families, susceptible viral candidates, antiviral assays, and the mode of therapeutic action; this attempt resulted in the collection of an enormous number of natural therapeutics that might be suggested for the treatment of COVID-19. About 219 plants from 83 families were found to have antiviral activity. Among them, 149 plants from 71 families were screened for the identification of the major plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) that might be effective for this pandemic. Our investigation revealed that the proposed plant metabolites can serve as potential anti- SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further optimization and drug development processes to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics caused by viruses. This review will stimulate further analysis by the scientific community and boost antiviral plant-based research followed by novel drug designing.","Bhuiyan, Farhana Rumzum; Howlader, Sabbir; Raihan, Topu; Hasan, Mahmudul",Front.

Applying an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly 1.6 million firms in Japan, we simulate what would happen to production activities outside Tokyo when production activities that are not essential to citizens' survival in Tokyo were shut down for a certain period. We find that when Tokyo is locked down for a month, the indirect effect on other regions would be twice as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of 27 trillion yen in Japan, or 5.3% of its annual GDP. Although the production shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the lockdown would result in a reduction of the daily production in Japan by 86% in a month.","Inoue, Hiroyasu; Todo, Yasuyuki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14002v1.pdf,614

Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. RESULTS: Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic. There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.","Vigneswaran, Yalini; Prachand, Vivek N; Posner, Mitchell C; Matthews, Jeffrey B; Hussain, Mustafa",J Gastrointest Surg,,614
590201,Implementation of warfarin to direct oral anticoagulant conversion initiative in pharmacist‐run anticoagulation clinics during COVID‐19 pandemic,2021-06-08,"High blood pressure is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality globally. Many patients remain on single-drug treatment with poor control although guidelines recognize that most require combination therapy for blood pressure control. Our hypothesis is that a single-pill combination of four blood pressure- lowering agents each at a quarter dose may provide a simple, safe and effective blood pressure lowering solution which may also improve long term-adherence. The QUARTET (Quadruple UltrA-low-dose tReaTment for hypErTension) double-blind, active controlled, randomized clinical trial will examine whether ultra-low-dose quadruple combination therapy is more effective than guideline recommended standard care, in lowering blood pressure. QUARTET will enroll 650 participants with high blood pressure, either on no treatment or on monotherapy. Participants will be randomized 1:1 and allocated to intervention therapy of a single pill (quadpill) containing irbesartan 37.5 mg, amlodipine 1.25 mg, indapamide 0.625 mg and bisoprolol 2.5 mg or to control therapy of a single identical appearing pill containing irbesartan 150 mg. In both arms step up therapy of open-label amlodipine 5 mg will be provided if BP is >140/90 at 6 weeks. The primary outcome is the difference between groups in the change from baseline in mean unattended automated office systolic blood pressure at 12 weeks follow-up.

590202,Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthodontic practice by orthodontists and orthodontic residents in Nigeria,2020-08-05,"Summary Background Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. While a substantial effort has been made to quantify progress towards SDG3, less research has focused on tracking spending towards this goal. We used spending estimates to measure progress in financing the priority areas of SDG3, examine the association between outcomes and financing, and identify where resource gains are most needed to achieve the SDG3 indicators for which data are available. Methods We estimated domestic health spending, disaggregated by source (government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private) from 1995 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. For disease-specific health spending, we estimated spending for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis for 135 low-income and middle-income countries, and malaria in 106 malaria-endemic countries, from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2019, by source, disbursing development agency, recipient, and health focus area, including DAH for pandemic preparedness. Finally, we estimated future health spending for 195 countries and territories from 2018 until 2030. We report all spending estimates in inflation-adjusted 2019 US$, unless otherwise stated. Findings Since the development and implementation of the SDGs in 2015, global health spending has increased, reaching $7·9 trillion (95% uncertainty interval 7·8–8·0) in 2017 and is expected to increase to $11·0 trillion (10·7–11·2) by 2030. In 2017, in low-income and middle-income countries spending on HIV/AIDS was $20·2 billion (17·0–25·0) and on tuberculosis it was $10·9 billion (10·3–11·8), and in malaria-endemic countries spending on malaria was $5·1 billion (4·9–5·4). Development assistance for health was $40·6 billion in 2019 and HIV/AIDS has been the health focus area to receive the highest contribution since 2004. In 2019, $374 million of DAH was provided for pandemic preparedness, less than 1% of DAH. Although spending has increased across HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria since 2015, spending has not increased in all countries, and outcomes in terms of prevalence, incidence, and per-capita spending have been mixed. The proportion of health spending from pooled sources is expected to increase from 81·6% (81·6–81·7) in 2015 to 83·1% (82·8–83·3) in 2030. Interpretation Health spending on SDG3 priority areas has increased, but not in all countries, and progress towards meeting the SDG3 targets has been mixed and has varied by country and by target. The evidence on the scale-up of spending and improvements in health outcomes suggest a nuanced relationship, such that increases in spending do not always results in improvements in outcomes. Although countries will probably need more resources to achieve SDG3, other constraints in the broader health system such as inefficient allocation of resources across interventions and populations, weak governance systems, human resource shortages, and drug shortages, will also need to be addressed.

590732,Essential Versus Nonessential: The Ethics of Conducting Non-COVID Research in a Population of Persons Living With Serious Illness During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Introduction: There has been little systematic exploration of what affects timeliness of epidemic response, despite the potential for earlier responses to be more effective. Speculations have circulated that exposure to major epidemics helped health systems respond more quickly to COVID-19. This study leverages organizational memory theory to test whether health systems with any, more severe, more recent exposure to major epidemics enacted timelier COVID-19 policy responses. Methods: A dataset was constructed cataloguing 719 policies across 177 health systems in total, 12 of which had major epidemics within the last twenty years. Hypotheses testing used cluster robust regressions with WHO region fixed effects, controlling for several health system expenditure and political variables. Results: Results show that exposure to any major epidemics was nearly significant (p = 0.07) with approximately 20 days earlier response. As the number of total cases from major epidemics increase by one, this was associated with 0.0028 day earlier response (p < 0.001). A decrease of one year from last major epidemics was also associated with 0.4020 day earlier response (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that health systems do learn from past major epidemics. Policymakers ought to institutionalize lessons from COVID-19 to prevent erosion of organizational memory, and learn from other more severely affected health systems. Future studies can examine specific generalizable lessons and whether timelier responses correlated with lower health and economic impacts.","Tsuei, S.

Existing processes were challenged to manage loss of staffing at facilities along with added workloads for COVID related study support including conducting preclinical testing, initiating clinical trials, conducting bioanalysis and interactions with regulatory agencies, all in an ultra-rapid timeframes. A key factor of success was creative rethinking of processes and removing barriers – some of which hitherto had been considered immovable.

590798,Medical and Mental Health Services in US Assisted Living Settings During COVID-19: Challenges and Opportunities,2021-03-31,"The COVID-19 pandemic gave an opportunity to adopt many appropriate changes in the behavior of the people in India. The major gears of those behavior changes were the enforcement by the government, fear, motivation (self and induced), and self-experiences or realizations with time. If those changes are fitted in the Trans-Theoretical Model, Indian people have passed through the “Pre-Contemplation” to “Action” stage of behavior changes during different phases of this pandemic. Frequent hand hygiene, maintaining physical distancing, use of face mask, cough etiquettes, avoid greetings through physical contacts, fear in spitting and urination at public places, refrain from gatherings and avoiding outside food are some of the examples of those appropriate behaviors which were enforced or learnt during the COVID pandemic. The continuous lockdown made people understand the difference between “want” and “need,” the importance of local production, and the significance of social media and technology in routine life. The work-from-home strategy gave a chance to appreciate the work--life balance in a more applied way. The first-ever lifetime experience of unbelievable rejuvenating nature because of lack of human play taught people to appreciate nature. Although the current focus is on responding to the pandemic and on coping with its immediate effects, yet this is the time when there is an urgent need to create an enabling environment to support and sustain these COVID-19 appropriate behaviors (maintenance stage) to reap the maximum benefits out of them. Sustaining these appropriate behaviors is also important considering the bimodal distribution of the COVID-19 and possibility of advent of the second wave of COVID-19 in near future.","Gupta, Manoj Kumar; Bhardwaj, P.; Goel, A.; Saurabh, S.; Misra, S.",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195109/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2382_20,614
591326,Impact of a pandemic on surgical neuro-oncology—maintaining functionality in the early phase of crisis,2021-01-18,"Abstract: Importance The COVID-19 pandemic is currently accelerating. Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited and the prevalence of infection is high. Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk for severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC. Observation We present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus opinion of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic, though guiding data is scarce. The overarching goals of these approaches are to reduce the number of visits to a healthcare facility, reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies, and provide effective oncologic therapy. Patients with resectable disease can be treated with definitive non-operative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high. Non-operative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available. The order of treatments may be based on patient factors and clinical resources. Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate. For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results. Conclusions and Relevance The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is significantly elevated for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapting alternative treatment strategies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisciplinary cancer team.","Kumar, Sameera; Chmura, Steven; Robinson, Clifford; Lin, Steven H.; Gadgeel, Shirish M.; Donington, Jessica; Feliciano, Josephine; Stinchcombe, Thomas E.; Werner-Wasik, Maria; Edelman, Martin J.; Moghanaki, Drew",J Thorac Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360578/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1556086420303312?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1556086420303312; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.04.016,614

We analysed the possible association between the appearance of ‘de novo’ headache according to the type of mask used, the related factors and the impact of the cephalalgia on health professionals. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a tertiary hospital in Extremadura, Spain. We provided an online questionnaire to healthcare workers during the period of maximum incidence of COVID-19 in our setting. RESULTS: The subjects are n=306, 244 women (79.7%), with an average age of 43 years (range 23–65). Of the total, 129 (42.2%) were physicians, 112 (36.6%) nurses and 65 (21.2%) other health workers. 208 (79.7%) used surgical masks and 53 (20.3%) used filter masks. Of all those surveyed, 158 (51.6%) presented ‘de novo’ headache. The occurrence of a headache was independently associated with the use of a filter mask, OR 2.14 (95% CI 1.07 to 4.32); being a nurse, OR 2.09 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.72) or another health worker, OR 6.94 (95% CI 3.01 to 16.04); or having a history of asthma, OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.89). According to the type of mask used, there were differences in headache intensity, and the impact of a headache in the subjects who used a filter mask was worse in all the aspects evaluated. CONCLUSION: The appearance of ‘de novo’ headache is associated with the use of filter masks and is more frequent in certain healthcare workers, causing a greater occupational, family, personal and social impact.","Ramirez-Moreno, José María; Ceberino, David; Gonzalez Plata, Alberto; Rebollo, Belen; Macias Sedas, Pablo; Hariramani, Roshan; Roa, Ana M; Constantino, Ana B",Occup Environ Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-106956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33380516/,614

One such pandemic strain of coronavirus was recently identified in December 2019 and lead to a devastating outbreak in Wuhan city of China. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is highly contagious which causes symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to highlight the current understanding, research and therapeutic updates of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted for research papers and patents in context to COVID-19. All articles with respect to this subject was taken from various public repositories such as Google Scholar, Pubmed, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Springer, Web of Science, etc. Results: The present analysis showed that key areas of the inventions were the vaccines and diagnostic kits apart from the composition for the treatment of CoV. It was also observed that no specific vaccine treatments are available for the treatment of 2019-nCov; however, developing novel chemical or biological drugs and kits for early diagnosis, prevention, and disease management is the primary governing topic among the patented inventions. The present study also indicates potential research opportunities for the future, particularly to combat 2019-nCoV. The current focus of the researches has turned towards developing four potential treatments including development of candidate vaccine, development of novel potential drugs, repurposing of existing drugs and development of convalescent plasma therapy. The PCR based diagnosis is the gold standard for the COVID-19 testing but it require resource time, expertise and high associated cost hence the researchers are also developing different diagnosis methods for the COVID-19. Although vaccines are being developed by various companies and have passed the pre-clinical stages but still there exists no guarantee for these to become the effective vaccine. The current treatments which are being used for COVID-19 patients are not well established and have limited success.

The aim of this study was to explore potential inequalities in care pathways for people with young-onset and late on-set dementia (YOD/LOD), including their family carers, with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurring throughout the course of the study and enabling a comparison between pre-pandemic and COVID-19 times. Methods: People with YOD and LOD with their family carers were recruited via local support groups in the North West Coast region of England. Semi-structured interviews explored the experiences of people with YOD and LOD and family carers on their access to both health and social care services and community-based services. Transcripts were coded by two researchers and analysed using thematic analysis. Fifteen interviews were conducted with seven people with YOD or LOD and 14 family carers between January and March 2020. Some interviews were conducted only with the person with dementia, because they did not have a family carer, and others were conducted only with the family carer, because the person with dementia was in the severe stages of the condition. Results: Four themes emerged from the interviews: (1) Getting the ball rolling: the process of diagnosis; (2) Balancing the support needs of people with dementia and carers; (3) Barriers to accessing support; and (4) Facilitators to accessing support. Inequities existed for both YOD and LOD, with emerging evidence of unequal experiences in accessing care at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: People with YOD and LOD and their carers require better support in accessing services after a diagnosis. Greater understanding of the pathways through which inequalities materialise are needed, especially those that might have been disrupted or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Giebel, Clarissa; Sutcliffe, Caroline; Darlington-Pollock, Frances; Green, Mark A.; Akpan, Asan; Dickinson, Julie; Watson, James; Gabbay, Mark",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466948/,614

592433,Deferring Elective Urologic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: the Patients’ Perspective,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND: The innate immune system is recognized as an essential aspect of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important in inducing antiviral response, triggering downstream production of interferons (IFNs). Certain loss-of-function variants in TLR7 are associated with increased COVID-19 disease severity, and imiquimod (ImiQ) is known to have immunomodulating effects as an agonist of TLR7. Given that topical imiquimod (topImiQ) is indicated for various dermatologic conditions, it is necessary for dermatologists to understand the interplay between innate immunity mechanisms and the potential role of ImiQ in COVID-19, with a particular focus on TLR7. SUMMARY: Our objective was to survey recent peer-reviewed scientific literature in the PubMed database, examine relevant evidence, and elucidate the relationships between IFNs, TLR7, the innate immune system, and topImiQ in the context of COVID-19. Despite limited studies on this topic, current evidence supports the critical role of TLRs in mounting a strong immune response against COVID-19. Of particular interest to dermatologists, topImiQ can result in systemic upregulation of the immune system via activation of TLR7. KEY MESSAGE: Given the role of TLR7 in the systemic activation of the immune system, ImiQ, as a ligand of the TLR7 receptor, may have potential therapeutic benefit as a topical immunomodulatory treatment for COVID-19.","Szeto, Mindy D.; Maghfour, Jalal; Sivesind, Torunn E.; Anderson, Jarett; Olayinka, Jadesola T.; Mamo, Andrina; Runion, Taylor M.; Dellavalle, Robert P.",Dermatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511591/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000518471,614

They have worked as doctors in mental health departments, surgery departments and emergency departments, nurses and management staffs; (2)Based on interviews and literature, the questionnaire survey is conducted among 528 medical personnel from all over the country who have participated in the fight against COVID-19 in Wuhan; (3)Use the structural equation modeling to explore the influence mechanism of medical staff's psychological stress and mental health in the prevention and control of COVID-19. Results: The epidemic severity in hospital and the work intensity are the important psychological stressors for the front-line medical staff. Self-risk perception has a mediating effect on the severity of epidemic in hospitals and mental health of medical staff. Social identification has no moderating effect between the self-risk perception and the mental health.","Yinggui, Qiu; Qian, Wu; Rui, Chen; Cuiling, Guan",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420921004854; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420921004854?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102524,614
593284,The Indirect Consequences of the Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-01-19,"Infections of emerging and reemerging viruses (SARS-CoVs, influenza H1N1, etc.) largely and globally affect human health. Animal models often fail to reflect a physiological status because of species tropism of virus infection. Conventional cell lines are usually genetically and phenotypically different from primary cells. Developing an in vitro physiological model to study the infection of emerging viruses will facilitate our understanding of virus-host cell interactions, thereby benefiting antiviral drug discovery. In the current work, we first established normal airway epithelial cells (upper and lower airway track) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and air-liquid interface (ALI) techniques. These long-term cultures maintained differentiation potential. More importantly, these cells express two types of influenza virus receptors, α2-6-Gal- and α2-3-Gal-linked sialic acids, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoVs as well. These cells were permissive to the infection of pandemic influenza H1N1 (H1N1pdm). In contrast, the lung cancer cell line A549 and immortalized airway epithelial cells (16HBE) were not susceptible to H1N1 infection. A virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on 2D CRC cultures developed in a time-dependent manner. The pathological effects were also readily observed spreading from the apical layer to the basal layer of the 3D ALI culture. This integrated 2D CRC and 3D ALI cultures provide a physiological and personalized in vitro model to study the infection of emerging viruses. This novel model can be used for studying virus biology and host response to viral infection and for antiviral drug discovery.","Xia, Siyu; Liu, Jun; Yang, Yan; Wu, Ming; Ye, Lina; Chen, Si; Zhang, Tao; Zeng, Zhihong; Zhang, Kang; Cai, Kaihong; Long, Xiang; Gao, Wenbin; Fang, Shisong; Li, Hui",Stem Cells Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32695180/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2421689,614

593688,Case Series: Ocular Trauma Secondary to Masks during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Coronaviruses are etiological agents of extreme human and animal infection resulting in abnormalities primarily in the respiratory tract. Presently, there is no defined COVID-19 intervention and clinical trials of prospective therapeutic agents are still in the nascent stage. Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS), is an important medicinal plant in Ayurveda. The present study aimed to evaluate the antiviral potential of selected WS phytoconstituents against the novel SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and human ACE2 receptor using in silico methods. Most of the phytoconstituents displayed good absorption and transport kinetics and were also found to display no associated mutagenic or adverse effect(s). Molecular docking analyses revealed that most of the WS phytoconstituents exhibited potent binding to human ACE2 receptor, SAR-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins as well as the two main SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Most of the phytoconstituents were predicted to undergo Phase-I metabolism prior to excretion. All phytoconstituents had favorable bioactivity scores with respect to various receptor proteins and target enzymes. SAR analysis revealed that the number of oxygen atoms in the withanolide backbone and structural rearrangements were crucial for effective binding. Molecular simulation analyses of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and papain-like protease with Withanolides A and B, respectively, displayed a stability profile at 300 K and constant RMSDs of protein side chains and Cα atoms throughout the simulation run time. In a nutshell, WS phytoconstituents warrant further investigations in vitro and in vivo to unravel their molecular mechanism(s) and modes of action for their future development as novel antiviral agents against COVID-19.

Detecting specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is a powerful supplement for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and is important for epidemiological studies and vaccine validations. Herein, a rapid and quantitative detection method of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody was built based on the optofluidic point-of-care testing fluorescence biosensor. Without complicated steps needed, the portable system is suitable for on-site sensitive determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in serum. Under the optimal conditions, the whole detection procedure is about 25 min with a detection limit of 12.5 ng/mL that can well meet the diagnostic requirements. The method was not obviously affected by IgM and serum matrix and demonstrated to have good stability and reliability in real sample analysis. Compared to ELISA test results, the proposed method exhibits several advantages including wider measurement range and easier operation. The method provides a universal platform for rapid and quantitative analysis of other related biomarkers, which is of significance for the prevention and control of COVID-19 pandemic.","Song, Dan; Liu, Jiayao; Xu, Wenjuan; Han, Xiangzhi; Wang, Hongliang; Cheng, Yuan; Zhuo, Yuxin; Long, Feng",Talanta,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914021007219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517658/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122800; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914021007219?v=s5,614
593972,Assessment of Patient Experiences in Otolaryngology Virtual Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-08,"INTRODUCTION: the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. South Sudan, a low-income and humanitarian response setting, reported its first case of COVID-19 on April 5, 2020. We describe the socio-demographic and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in this setting. METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of data for 1,330 confirmed COVID-19 cases from the first 60 days of the outbreak. RESULTS: among the 1,330 confirmed cases, the mean age was 37.1 years, 77% were male, 17% were symptomatic with 95% categorized as mild, and the case fatality rate was 1.1%. Only 24.7% of cases were detected through alerts and sentinel site surveillance, with 95% of the cases reported from the capital, Juba. Epidemic doubling time averaged 9.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.7 - 13.4), with an attack rate of 11.5 per 100,000 population. Test positivity rate was 18.2%, with test rate per 100,000 population of 53 and mean test turn-around time of 9 days. The case to contact ratio was 1: 2.2. CONCLUSION: this 2-month initial period of COVID-19 in South Sudan demonstrated mostly young adults and men affected, with most cases reported as asymptomatic. Systems´ limitations highlighted included a small proportion of cases detected through surveillance, low testing rates, low contact elicitation, and long collection to test turn-around times limiting the country´s ability to effectively respond to the outbreak. A multi-pronged response including greater access to testing, scale-up of surveillance, contact tracing and community engagement, among other interventions are needed to improve the COVID-19 response in this setting.","Waya, Joy Luba Lomole; Lako, Richard; Bunga, Sudhir; Chun, Helen; Mize, Valerie; Ambani, Boniface; Wamala, Joseph Francis; Guyo, Argata Guracha; Gray, John Henry; Gai, Malick; Maleghemi, Sylvester; Kol, Matthew; Rumunu, John; Tukuru, Michael; Olu, Olushayo Oluseun",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.37.384.27486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796197/,614

594072,COVID-19 pandemic inpatient bed allocation planning – A Canada-wide approach,2020-12-26,"Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was first described in December 2019 in China leading to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It was named by the World Health Organization as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and it garnered unprecedented attention from public health researchers around the world, and studies analyzing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a possible therapy have arisen in the last 2 months. Objective To review the literature and describe updated facts about the ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, an important side effect that can be present in patients with COVID-19 treated with these drugs. Data Synthesis The most typical treatment regimen is 5 days of hydroxychloroquine at daily doses of 400 to 600 mg. There is no randomized clinical trial that can prove so far the efficacy of this medication, and few studies have evaluated adverse events potentially linked to their use in patients with COVID-19. While there is no concrete evidence on the incidence of ototoxicity using chloroquine in the short term, we need to consider that, as a pandemic disease, millions of patients with COVID-19 may receive this treatment, and ototoxicity can be a possible adverse event. Conclusion Despite the urgent global situation caused by the COVID-19, the risk of irreversible hearing loss may outweigh the unproven benefit of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, especially in patients with mild forms of COVID-19, who may be cured with supportive treatment. The potential hearing loss that can be caused by these medications may advise against their use in COVID-19 patients.","Monteiro, Eduardo Machado Rossi; Nascimento, Maria Fernanda Lima; Brito, Thayanne Rachel Cangussu; Lima, Marcos Correia; Sefair, Laura Rodrigues; Pedrosa, Maisa Mendes",Int Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1714142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32774508/,614

First, the number of excess deaths has contributed to an immense number of bereaved individuals. Second, recent literature has shown that circumstances associated with COVID-19 deaths may be contributing to increased risk for the development of prolonged grief disorder. OBJECTIVE: To best support those affected by loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to inform clinicians and researchers about the development, the nature and the treatment of prolonged grief disorder and employ sound research. METHOD: In this editorial, we discuss important themes regarding prolonged grief disorder in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, to gather and present useful information for clinicians and researchers. RESULTS: The following themes were addressed: 1. Harmonization in the diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder. 2. Screening tools and interventions. 3. Pharmacotherapy. 4. Special attention for the elderly. 5. Special attention for children and adolescents. 6. A causal system perspective for understanding grief and prolonged grief disorder. CONCLUSIONS: If those involved in bereavement research and care manage to collaborate, the tragic consequences of COVID-19 might catalyse improvement of care for those most impaired following the loss of a loved one.","Djelantik, A.

Notre objectif était de décrire la courbe épidémique chez les personnels hospitaliers et d’en préciser les déterminants ainsi que l’impact des mesures de prévention en comparant un centre adulte et pédiatrique. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude prospective a comparé un centre majoritairement adulte de 1500 lits et un centre principalement pédiatrique de 600 lits d’un groupe hospitalier universitaire, employant respectivement 7916 et 5362 personnes. Entre le 24/02/20 et le 10/04/20, tous les personnels hospitaliers symptomatiques ont été dépistés pour le SARS-CoV-2 par PCR sur un écouvillon nasopharyngé. Les personnels positifs ont été interrogés sur leur profession, leurs symptômes et leurs expositions professionnelles et non-professionnelles au SARS-CoV-2. Résultats Parmi 1344 personnels testés, 373 étaient positifs (28 %) et 336 (90 %) questionnaires ont été complétés (227 dans le centre adulte, 109 dans le centre pédiatrique). Trois membres du personnel ont été hospitalisés et aucun n’est décédé. La plupart avaient une activité de soins directs aux patients (234/336, 70 %) mais une minorité dans une unité dédiée au COVID-19 (75/336, 22 %). Le nombre de personnels hospitaliers infectés a atteint son pic au 23 mars puis a diminué progressivement, en parallèle d’une augmentation continue de la compliance aux mesures de prévention (incluant port du masque chirurgical systématique dans l’hôpital, renforcement de l’hygiène des mains et équipement de protection auprès des patients COVID-19 suspects ou confirmés). Ce contrôle de l’épidémie chez les soignants intervenait alors que le nombre de malades hospitalisés pour COVID-19 augmentait et que l’épidémie était à son pic dans la région. Les taux d’attaque étaient de 251/7916 (3,2 %) dans le centre adulte et de 122/5362 (2,3 %) dans le centre pédiatrique (p =0,002). Dans le centre adulte, les personnels hospitaliers rapportaient plus fréquemment avoir eu au moins un contact quotidien avec un patient COVID-19 sans protection individuelle par rapport au centre pédiatrique (50/227 [25 %] vs 25/109 [15 %], p =0,046). Dans les deux centres, les contacts avec des enfants gardés en collectivité en dehors du domicile diminuaient très significativement au cours de la période étudiée. Conclusion Le port universel du masque chirurgical, le renforcement de l’hygiène des mains et les mesures de protection individuelles incluant le masque chirurgical pour la plupart des soins directs aux patients COVID-19 ont permis de contenir l’épidémie de SARS-CoV-2 chez le personnel hospitalier et de protéger les soignants. Cela suggère par ailleurs une transmission du virus principalement liée aux gouttelettes. Les transmissions résiduelles semblaient dues à des expositions à des patients ou collègues non diagnostiqués mais pas au fait d’avoir des enfants gardés dans les structures d’accueil (crèches, écoles) maintenues ouvertes pour les personnels hospitaliers pendant l’épidémie.","Contejean, A.; Leporrier, J.; Canouï, E.; Alby-Laurent, F.; Lafont, E.; Frange, P.; Leruez-Ville, M.; Rozenberg, F.; Lortholary, O.; Kernéis, S.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X2030281X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X2030281X,614

OBJECTIVE: To determine the adjusted effect of body mass index (BMI), associated comorbidities, time, neighborhood-level sociodemographic factors, and other factors on risk for death due to COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large integrated health care organization. PATIENTS: Kaiser Permanente Southern California members diagnosed with COVID-19 from 13 February to 2 May 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable Poisson regression estimated the adjusted effect of BMI and other factors on risk for death at 21 days; models were also stratified by age and sex. RESULTS: Among 6916 patients with COVID-19, there was a J-shaped association between BMI and risk for death, even after adjustment for obesity-related comorbidities. Compared with patients with a BMI of 18.5 to 24 kg/m(2), those with BMIs of 40 to 44 kg/m(2) and greater than 45 kg/m(2) had relative risks of 2.68 (95% CI, 1.43 to 5.04) and 4.18 (CI, 2.12 to 8.26), respectively. This risk was most striking among those aged 60 years or younger and men. Increased risk for death associated with Black or Latino race/ethnicity or other sociodemographic characteristics was not detected. LIMITATION: Deaths occurring outside a health care setting and not captured in membership files may have been missed. CONCLUSION: Obesity plays a profound role in risk for death from COVID-19, particularly in male patients and younger populations. Our capitated system with more equalized health care access may explain the absence of effect of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities on death. Our data highlight the leading role of severe obesity over correlated risk factors, providing a target for early intervention.

There are rigorous containment measures on industries, non-essential business, transportation, and citizen mobility to check the spread. The lockdowns may have an advantageous impact on reducing the atmospheric pollutants. This study has analyzed the change in atmospheric pollutants, based on the Sentinel–5Ps and ground-station observed data during partial to complete lockdown period in 2020. Results revealed that the mean tropospheric NO(2) concentration substantially dropped in 2020 due to lockdown against the same period in 2019 by 18–40% over the major urban areas located in Europe (i.e. Madrid, Milan, Paris) and the USA (i.e. New York, Boston, and Springfield). Conversely, urban areas with partial to no lockdown measures (i.e. Warsaw, Pierre, Bismarck, and Lincoln) exhibited a relatively lower dropdown in mean NO(2) concentration (3 to 7.5%). The role of meteorological variability was found to be negligible. Nevertheless, the reduced levels of atmospheric pollutants were primarily attributed to the shutdown of vehicles, power plants, and industrial emissions. Improvement in air quality during COVID-19 may be temporary, but regulatory bodies should learn to reduce air pollution on a long-term basis concerning the trade-offs between the environment, society, and economic growth. The intersection of urban design, health, and environment should be addressed by policy-makers to protect public health and sustainable urban policies could be adopted to build urban resilience against any future emergencies.","Bar, Somnath; Parida, Bikash Ranjan; Mandal, Shyama Prasad; Pandey, Arvind Chandra; Kumar, Navneet; Mishra, Bibhudatta",Cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275121002080?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264275121002080; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127873/,614

596986,Care Delivery for Children With Epilepsy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An International Survey of Clinicians,2020-07-15,"High traffic volume is one of the main contributors to wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) and wildlife mortality on roads. Government shelter-in-place (SIP) orders have been used to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, resulting in unprecedented reductions in global traffic volumes. Using traffic and collision data from four US states (California, Idaho, Maine, and Washington), we investigated changes in total WVC, following the state and local SIP orders. From mid-March to mid-April 2020, these orders have resulted in up to 71%, 63%, 73%, and 72% reduction in driving, as measured by vehicle miles traveled (VMT), in CA, ID, ME, and WA respectively. The daily WVC rates from the 4 weeks prior to SIP orders going into effect, to the 4 weeks after, declined 34%, with 21, 36, 44, and 33% declines for CA, ID, ME, and WA, respectively. For mountain lions (Puma concolor) in CA, there was a 58% decline in mortality during the traffic reduction. The changes in WVC from 1 month pre-SIP orders to 1 month post-order only occurred in 2020 and not 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, or 2019, suggesting that the reductions were associated with the reductions in traffic. The measured declines in WVC reversed in ME and WA during May, June and July 2020, paralleling reversals in traffic volumes. A 34% reduction in WVC would potentially equate to 10s of millions fewer vertebrates killed on US roadways during one month of traffic reduction, representing an unintentional conservation action unprecedented in modern times.","Shilling, Fraser; Nguyen, Tricia; Saleh, Malak; Kyaw, Min Khant; Tapia, Karla; Trujillo, Gabrielle; Bejarano, Mireya; Waetjen, Dave; Peterson, Jon; Kalisz, Glen; Sejour, Raquel; Croston, Sarah; Ham, Eric",Biological Conservation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320721000653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580543/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006320721000653,614

Secondary objectives were to estimate degree of risk based on country of origin; to assess knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 control measures; and subjective well-being during the quarantine period. Design: Prospective cohort of arriving international travelers. Setting: Toronto Pearson Airport Terminal 1, Toronto, Canada. Participants: Passengers arriving on international flights. Inclusion criteria were those aged 18 or older who had a final destination within 100 km of the airport; spoke English or French; and provided consent. Excluded were those taking a connecting flight; who had no internet access; who exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival; or who were exempted from quarantine. Main outcome measures: Positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus on RT-PCR with self-administered nasal-oral swab, and general well-being using the WHO-5 index. Results: Of 16,361 passengers enrolled, 248 (1.5%, 95% CI 1.3%,1.5%) tested positive. Of these, 167 (67%) were identified on arrival, 67 (27%) on day 7, and 14 (6%) on day 14. The positivity rate increased from 1% in September to 2% in October. Average well-being score declined from 19.8 (out of a maximum of 25) to 15.5 between arrival and day 7 (p<0.001). Conclusions: A single arrival test will pick up two-thirds of individuals who will become positive, with most of the rest detected on the second test at day 7.

In cardiac and aortic surgery, as it is with most specialities, elective surgeries were halted. AIMS OF THE STUDY: We captured reflections, contingencies, and current practices across of high‐volume centers in cardiac and aortic surgery globally. We also aimed this study to assess decision on prioritization of the surgical patients, the need for personal protection equipment, and the choice of preoperative investigations in current dynamic and fluid climate. METHODS: A validated web‐based questionnaire was constructed and was circulated to the international surgeons amongst high volume cardiac and aortic surgery centers. Their intrinsic feedback on decision making, the impact of the lockdown, and perspectives for the future ahead of us all were noted. A mixed‐method approach was constructed. Qualitative data analysis was introduced to signify the impact globally. RESULTS: Overall, 23 centers from 18 countries participated in this international study. About 91.7% of the respondents stopped operating on elective patients during the pandemic. The majority of the surgeons agreed that acute aortic dissection (87.1%) should be operated as an emergency procedure and stable triple vessel disease (87.1%) to be considered as an elective procedure. Three‐fifth (60%) of the respondents relied on computerized tomography chest as a preoperative screening modality. CONCLUSION: In the present climate where there is a paucity of evidence, this will give an interim consensus for the cardiac surgeons. With the increase in the cumulative number of patients with COVID‐19, careful utilization of the resources regarding hospital beds and manpower is of paramount importance.","Idhrees, Mohammed; Bashir, Mohamad; Mousavizadeh, Mostafa; Hosseini, Saeid",J Card Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789915/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14910,614
598444,Bridging the Emergency Psychiatry and Telepsychiatry Care: Will COVID-19 lead to evolution of another model?,2020-09-23,"Vectors developed from adeno-associated virus (AAV) are powerful tools for in vivo transgene delivery in both humans and animal models, and several AAV-delivered gene therapies are currently approved for clinical use. However, AAV-mediated gene therapy still faces several challenges, including limited vector packaging capacity and the need for a safe, effective method for controlling transgene expression during and after delivery. Riboswitches, RNA elements which control gene expression in response to ligand binding, are attractive candidates for regulating expression of AAV-delivered transgene therapeutics because of their small genomic footprints and non-immunogenicity compared to protein-based expression control systems. In addition, the ligand-sensing aptamer domains of many riboswitches can be exchanged in a modular fashion to allow regulation by a variety of small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides. Riboswitches have been used to regulate AAV-delivered transgene therapeutics in animal models, and recently developed screening and selection methods allow rapid isolation of riboswitches with novel ligands and improved performance in mammalian cells. This review discusses the advantages of riboswitches in the context of AAV-delivered gene therapy, the subsets of riboswitch mechanisms which have been shown to function in human cells and animal models, recent progress in riboswitch isolation and optimization, and several examples of AAV-delivered therapeutic systems which might be improved by riboswitch regulation.","Tickner, Zachary J.; Farzan, Michael",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200913/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14060554,614

The objective of this study was to describe the PKPD relationship of chloroquine and its major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, in a P. vivax volunteer infection study. We analyzed data from 24 healthy subjects who were inoculated with blood‐stage P. vivax malaria and administered a standard treatment course of chloroquine. The PK of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine was described by a two‐compartment model with first‐order absorption and elimination. The relationship between plasma and whole blood concentrations of chloroquine and P. vivax parasitemia was characterized by a PKPD delayed response model, where the equilibration half‐lives were 32.7 h (95% CI: 27.4–40.5) for plasma data and 24.1 h (95% CI: 19.0–32.7) for whole blood data. The estimated parasite multiplication rate was 17 folds per 48 hours (95% CI: 14–20) and maximum parasite killing rate by chloroquine was 0.213 h(‐1) (95% CI: 0.196–0.230), translating to a parasite clearance half‐life of 4.5 h (95% CI: 4.1–5.0) and a parasite reduction ratio of 400 every 48 hours (95% CI: 320–500). This is the first study that characterized the PKPD relationship between chloroquine plasma and whole blood concentrations and P. vivax clearance using a semi‐mechanistic population PKPD modelling. This PKPD model can be used to optimize dosing scenarios and to identify optimal dosing regimens for chloroquine where resistance to chloroquine is increasing.","Abd‐Rahman, Azrin N.; Marquart, Louise; Gobeau, Nathalie; Kümmel, Anne; Simpson, Julie A.; Chalon, Stephan; Möhrle, Jörg J.; McCarthy, James S.",Clin Pharmacol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32415986/,614

Bell’s palsy, herpes-zoster, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and other neurological complaints in proximity to vaccination have received special public attention. We compared their rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. METHODS: Individuals ≥16 years vaccinated with at least one dose of BNT162b2 were eligible for this historical-cohort study in a health maintenance organization insuring 1.2 million citizens. Each vaccinee was matched to a non-vaccinated control by sex, age, population sector (general Jewish, Arab, ultra-orthodox Jewish) and comorbidities. Diagnosis of Covid-19 before or after vaccination was an exclusion criterion. The outcome was a diagnosis of: Bell’s palsy, GBS, herpes-zoster, or symptoms of numbness or tingling, coded in the visit diagnosis field using ICD-9 codes. Diagnoses of Bell’s palsy and GBS were verified by individual file review. RESULTS: Of 406,148 individuals vaccinated during the study period, 394,609 (97.2%) were eligible (11,539 excluded). 233,159 (59.1%) were matched with unvaccinated controls. Mean follow was 43±15.14 days. In vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals there were 23 versus 24 cases of Bell’s palsy (RR 0.96, CI 0.54-1.70), 1 versus 0 cases of GBS, 151 versus 141 cases of herpes-zoster (RR 1.07, CI 0.85-1.35), and 605 versus 497 cases of numbness or tingling (RR 1.22, CI 1.08-1.37), respectively.

Although recent studies suggested the effectiveness of state social distancing measures in the United States on curbing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among the general population, there is lack of evidence as to how these state orders may have affected nursing home patients or what potential negative health consequences they may have had. In this longitudinal study, we evaluated changes in state strength of social distancing restrictions from June to August of 2020, and their associations with the weekly numbers of new COVID-19 cases, new COVID-19 deaths, and new non-COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes of the US. We found that stronger state social distancing measures were associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes (case and death rates), reduced across-facility disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, but more deaths due to non-COVID-19 reasons among nursing home residents.","Li, Y.; Cheng, Z.; Cai, X.; Mao, Y.; Temkin-Greener, H.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594372/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.08.21251382v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.08.21251382,614

We investigated whether viral URTI is temporally associated with an increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration. Episodes of symptomatic RSV or rhinovirus URTI among children <5 years were identified from a longitudinal household study in rural Kenya. lytA and alu PCR were performed on nasopharyngeal samples collected twice-weekly, to measure the pneumococcal concentration adjusted for the concentration of human DNA present. Pneumococcal concentration increased with a fold-change of 3.80 (95%CI 1.95–7.40), with acquisition of RSV or rhinovirus, during 51 URTI episodes among 42 children. In repeated swabs from the baseline period, in the two weeks before URTI developed, within-episode variation was broad; within +/−112-fold range of the geometric mean. We observed only a small increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration during RSV or rhinovirus URTI, relative to natural variation. Other factors, such as host response to viral infection, may be more important than nasopharyngeal pneumococcal concentration in determining risk of invasive disease.","Morpeth, Susan C.; Munywoki, Patrick; Hammitt, Laura L.; Bett, Anne; Bottomley, Christian; Onyango, Clayton O.; Murdoch, David R.; Nokes, D.

This study was designed and conducted to assess the emotional, cognitive, and behavioural reactions of physicians to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods An online survey questionnaire using the google forms platform was constructed by the authors. The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020. Results We received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism. Conclusion Physicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment. Healthcare settings need to be ready for emergencies and should focus on reducing uncertainty in physicians. These factors may also be gainfully used in the mental health promotion of physicians in COVID-19 care roles.","Aneja, P.; Singh, I.; Singh, B.; Kundi, P. S.; Kathiravan, S.; Singh, S.

Remembering nurses who have died from Covid-19,2020-07-30,"Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most common causative agents of infections that affect renal transplant recipients. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has rapidly spread worldwide. The clinical presentation of this infection can vary from an asymptomatic course to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Little of studies reported the Coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and Cytomegalovirus. Method(s): We describe the first case of COVID-19 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) co-infection in kidney transplant recipient. Result(s): A 36 years old woman, with a clinical history of severe lupus erythematosus received a renal transplant from cadaveric donor on October 02, 2019. Her immunosuppressant regime included prednisone 5mg daily,tacrolimus0.15mg/kg/day and Sirolimus 1mg daily.Of note, the hydroxychloroquine was interrupted since six years ago due to toxic maculopathy.On july 23, 2020, she was hospitalized for recurrent CMV disease treated by intra veinous gancilovir 10 mg/kg/day for 60 days. On day 35 of hospitalization, she presented an isolated cough. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable, including breath sounds on chest auscultation. Her oxygen saturation was 98%. A routine blood test showed worsening lymphopenia, initially improved with the gancilovir therapy.She elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The liver enzymes were slightly increased and her serum creatinine was still within the normal range.However,cough disappeared after72 hours. In the meantime, a COVID-19 was diagnosed in the nurse who taked care of our patient.As part of contact tracing, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed for she and it was positive for SARS CoV-2.However, she had no complaints.Her physical examination and her laboratory testing were otherwise unremarkable. Conclusion(s): we report the first case of COVID-19 in kidney transplant patient in our country with excellent outcome despite the coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). So, it can be supposed that she might be protected by the antiviral therapy, ganciclovir or by the immunomodulatory effects of CMV.

We aimed to examine how laboratory errors may arise from factors, e.g., flexible working order, staff displacement, changes in the number of tests, and samples will reflect on the total test process (TTP) during the pandemic period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 12 months, 6 months before and during the pandemic, laboratory errors were assessed via quality indicators (QIs) related to TTP phases. QIs were grouped as pre-, intra- and postanalytical. The results of QIs were expressed in defect percentages and sigma, evaluated with 3 levels of performance quality: 25(th), 50(th) and 75(th) percentile values. RESULTS: When the pre- and during pandemic periods were compared, the sigma value of the samples not received was significantly lower in pre-pandemic group than during pandemic group (4.7σ vs. 5.4σ, P = 0.003). The sigma values of samples transported inappropriately and haemolysed samples were significantly higher in pre-pandemic period than during pandemic (5.0σ vs. 4.9σ, 4.3σ vs. 4.1σ; P = 0.046 and P = 0.044, respectively). Sigma value of tests with inappropriate IQC performances was lower during pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period (3.3σ vs. 3.2σ, P = 0.081). Sigma value of the reports delivered outside the specified time was higher during pandemic than pre-pandemic period (3.0σ vs. 3.1σ, P = 0.030). CONCLUSION: In all TTP phases, some quality indicators improved while others regressed during the pandemic period. It was observed that preanalytical phase was affected more by the pandemic.","Eren, Funda; Tuncay, Merve Ergin; Oguz, Esra Firat; Neselioglu, Salim; Erel, Ozcan",Biochem Med (Zagreb),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140836/; https://doi.org/10.11613/bm.2021.020713,614

This study aimed to determine the sufficiency of the hospital beds available to the healthcare system of Yamanashi, Japan, in accommodating hospitalized and severely ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In total, 60 hospitals, with > 20 beds each, were included in this study (n = 10,684). However, beds in the psychiatric and tuberculosis wards (n = 2,295), nonoperational beds (n = 376), and beds for patients in the recovery and chronic phases (n = 3,494) were excluded. The projected occupancy rate was calculated based on the estimated number of patients, including severely ill patients requiring hospitalization during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the number of hospitalized patients, we created an adjusted model to calculate the mean occupancy rate of beds for each medical area in the prefecture (Model 1), which is free of areal occupancy rate biases. Moreover, we created an adjusted model that places severely ill patients in the two advanced acute hospitals in Yamanashi, thereby calculating the bed occupancy rates in other hospitals with > 200 beds (Model 2). RESULTS: A total of 4,519 beds were analyzed. Although the existing infectious disease beds may not be able to accommodate the projected number of severely ill patients, the existing capacity can accommodate all patients projected to require hospitalization during the pandemic. In Model 1, the mean bed occupancy rate was 50%. Conversely, in Model 2, advanced acute hospital beds were insufficient for the projected number of severely ill patients, and the mean bed occupancy rate was 72.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustment of patients across the medical area borders enables the existing hospital beds to accommodate the estimated number of patients requiring hospitalization or those who are severely ill.","Kojin, Hiroyuki; Inoue, Osamu; Kinouchi, Hiroyuki",JMA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575500/; https://doi.org/10.31662/jmaj.2020-0034,614

Sudden onset loss of smell and/or taste has been increasingly reported as a symptom of COVID-19. However, prevalence of these symptoms, and its severity varies widely between studies, with little data on its duration and recovery rate. Since this significantly impacts the quality of life of patients, there is a need for a study to provide insight into the loss of smell or taste in terms of its correlation with other upper respiratory tract symptoms, natural history and resolution rates. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 718 mild to moderately symptomatic adult patients (≥ 18 years), admitted consecutively to Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Odisha, India between June 25 and July 24, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Prevalence, severity, duration and factors associated with altered smell or taste sensation, and their follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 718 patients included in the study at baseline [563 (78%) men; median age 34 years], 101 (14%) patients experienced either altered smell or taste, with 52 (7%) experiencing both altered smell and taste. Seventy-seven (10.7%) patients had altered smell and 76 patients had altered taste (10.5%). Of these, 71 (92%) and 73 (96%) regained their sense of smell and taste, respectively, by 14 days after their swab tested positive. Presence of fever (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.7–10.6, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.2–4.2, p = 0.009) and nasal obstruction (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.4–6.7, p = 0.006) were independently associated with increased likelihood of experiencing both altered taste and smell in multivariable models. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of altered smell and taste in Indians was much lower compared to Europeans and similar to East Asians. Majority regained these senses by 2 weeks.

The volume of cardiac surgery cases has to comply with the mandatory constraints of healthcare capacities. The treatment of Covid-19-positive patients must also be considered. Unfortunately, no scientific evidence is available on this issue. Therefore, this study aimed to offer some consensus-based considerations, derived from available scientific papers, regarding the organization and performance of cardiac surgery against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Key recommendations were extracted from recent literature concerning cardiac surgery. RESULTSː Reducing elective cardiac procedures should be based on frequent clinical assessment of patients on the waiting list (every one or two weeks) and the current local status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Screening tests at admission for every patient are broadly recommended. Where appropriate, alternative treatment methods can be considered, including percutaneous techniques and minimally invasive surgery, if performed by experienced cardiac surgery teams. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence on the strategies to organize cardiac surgery in the Covid-19 pandemic. Most authors agree on reducing elective operations based on patients’ clinical condition and the status of the Covid-19 pandemic. Admission screenings and the use of percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches should be preferred to reduce in-hospital stays.","Juraszek, Andrzej; Kuriata, Jarosław; Kołsut, Piotr; Hryniewiecki, Tomasz; Różewicz-Juraszek, Monika; Dziodzio, Tomasz; Kuśmierczyk, Mariusz",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836795/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-021-01419-9,614

A comparative analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) can expand the available knowledge regarding the virology and potential drug targets against these viruses. Interestingly, comparing HCV with SARS-CoV-2 reveals major similarities between them, ranging from the ion channels that are utilized, to the symptoms that are exhibited by patients. Via this comparative analysis, and from what is known about HCV, the most promising treatments for COVID-19 can focus on the reduction of viral load, treatment of pulmonary system damages, and reduction of inflammation. In particular, the drugs that show most potential in this regard include ritonavir, a combination of peg-IFN, and lumacaftor-ivacaftor. This review anaylses SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of the role of ion homeostasis and channels in viral pathomechanism.

Conclusion: This report describes a familial cluster of fatal COVID-19 infections and suggests a potential genetic predisposition for severe disease, emphasizing the importance of investigating family clusters of severe COVID-19 infection to determine host and viral factors that may predispose to a severe disease course. Such investigations could improve our understanding of the disease and guide preventive measures for at-risk populations.","Lowe, Adam; Chang, Donald D.; Creek, Grady",Ochsner J,https://doi.org/10.31486/toj.20.0056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612465/,614
604079,Are surgical and non-operating room intervention safe in the COVID-19 pandemic? A retrospective study,2021-09-16,"Introduction: 2019-novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has recently struck Northern Italy. Limited data are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy and infancy, mostly from China. Herein, our experience on a safe perinatal management of neonates born to COVID-19 mothers is reported. Method: Since late February through May 15, 2020, 375 pregnant women delivered at our City Hospital in Piacenza, at the epicenter of the Italian epidemic. Of these, 144 were tested via a SARS-CoV-2 quantitative rRT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab prior to delivery, firstly on the basis of epidemiological and clinical criteria, then adopting a universal screening approach. All newborns from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers were tested via nasopharyngeal swab at birth, on day 3 and/or day 7. In case of positive result, they were re-tested on day 14. Results: Fifteen women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All newborns except one were born at term. All of them were non-infected at birth, irrespective of mode of delivery; 13 out 15 remained negative; the two positive neonates became negative by day 14 of life. All of them have always remained asymptomatic. All newborns except two were allowed to have immediate bonding, permanent rooming-in, and direct breastfeeding. Conclusions: Our study supports the claim that COVID-19 in pregnancy is not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to non-COVID-19 pregnant women and/or with higher rates of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction. Intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 seems to be unlikely. Breastfeeding appears to be safe and protective for the neonate, once appropriate preventive measures are adopted.","Biasucci, Giacomo; Cannalire, Giuseppe; Raymond, Akamin; Capra, Maria Elena; Benenati, Belinda; Vadacca, Giovanni; Schiavo, Roberta; Pavesi, Cristiana; Bonini, Renza",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194893/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.565522,614

We investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, for its effect on viral infectivity. This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the 2013–2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V had heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The increased infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1 sequences at the EBOV interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality, consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.","Diehl, William E.; Lin, Aaron E.; Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Carvalho, Luiz Max; Kim, Kyusik; Kyawe, Pyae Phyo; McCauley, Sean M.; Donnard, Elisa; Kucukural, Alper; McDonel, Patrick; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Garber, Manuel; Rambaut, Andrew; Andersen, Kristian G.; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Luban, Jeremy",Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867416313976; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.014; http://www.cell.com/article/S0092867416313976/pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27814506/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416313976,614

Camostat and nafamostat are serine protease inhibitors that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in vitro but have not been characterised for chemoprophylaxis in animal models. Clinically, nafamostat is limited to intravenous delivery and while camostat is orally available, both drugs have extremely short plasma half-lives. This study sought to determine whether intranasal dosing at 5 mg/kg twice daily was able to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected to uninfected Syrian golden hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was above the limits of quantification in both saline- and camostat-treated hamsters 5 days after cohabitation with a SARS-CoV-2 inoculated hamster. However, intranasal nafamostat-treated hamsters remained RNA negative for the full 7 days of cohabitation. Changes in body weight over the course of the experiment were supportive of a lack of clinical symptomology in nafamostat-treated but not saline- or camostat-treated animals. These data are strongly supportive of the utility of intranasally delivered nafamostat for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and further studies are underway to confirm absence of pulmonary infection and pathological changes.","Neary, M; Box, H; Sharp, J; Tatham, L; Curley, P; Herriott, J; Kijak, E; Arshad, U; Hobson, JJ; Rajoli, RKR; Pertinez, H; Valentijn, A; Dhaliwal, K; McCaughan, F; Rannard, SP; Kipar, A; Stewart, JP; Owen, A",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268511/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.451654,614

Currently, no specific antiviral therapy against ZIKV is available, and treatments are palliative and mainly directed toward the relief of symptoms, such as fever and rash, by administering antipyretics, anti-histamines, and fluids for dehydration. Nevertheless, lately, search for antivirals has been a major aim in ZIKV investigations. To do so, screening of libraries from different sources, testing of natural compounds, and repurposing of drugs with known antiviral activity have allowed the identification of several antiviral candidates directed to both viral (structural proteins and enzymes) and cellular elements. Here, we present an updated review of current knowledge about anti-ZIKV strategies, focusing on host-directed antivirals as a realistic alternative to combat ZIKV infection.","Saiz, Juan-Carlos; de Oya, Nereida Jiménez; Blázquez, Ana-Belén; Escribano-Romero, Estela; Martín-Acebes, Miguel A.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v10090453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30149598/,614

Human complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role in the clearance of complement opsonized molecules and may facilitate the entry of pathogens into host cells. Distinct CR1 exon 29 variants have been found associated with CR1 expression levels, increased susceptibility and pathophysiology of several diseases. In this study, CR1 plasma levels were assessed by ELISA and CR1 variants in exon 29 by sequencing in a Brazilian cohort of 232 chronic CD patients and 104 healthy controls. CR1 levels were significantly decreased in CD patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001). The CR1 rs1704660G, rs17047661G and rs6691117G variants were significantly associated with CD and in high linkage disequilibrium. The CR1*AGAGTG haplotype was associated with T. cruzi infection (p = 0.035, OR 3.99, CI 1.1-14.15) whereas CR1*AGGGTG was related to the risk of chagasic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.028, OR 12.15, CI 1.13-113).

To date, only a few studies have addressed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited immunity in this immunocompromised population. METHODS: We assessed immunogenicity of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in at-risk dialysis patients and characterised systemic cellular and humoral immune responses in serum and saliva using interferon γ release assay and multiplex-based cytokine and immunoglobulin measurements. We further compared binding capacity and neutralization efficacy of vaccination-induced immunoglobulins against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Epsilon and Cluster 5 by ACE2-RBD competition assay. FINDINGS: Patients on maintenance haemodialysis exhibit detectable but variable cellular and humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern after a two-dose regimen of BNT162b2. Although vaccination-induced immunoglobulins were detectable in saliva and plasma, both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralization efficacy was reduced compared to a vaccinated non-dialysed control population. Similarly, T-cell mediated interferon γ release after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was significantly diminished. INTERPRETATION: Quantifiable humoral and cellular immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination in individuals on maintenance haemodialysis are encouraging, but urge for longitudinal follow-up to assess longevity of immunity. Diminished virus neutralization and interferon γ responses in the face of emerging variants of concern may favour this at-risk population for re-vaccination using modified vaccines at the earliest opportunity.

Therefore, it is not surprising that TRP channels have been implicated in numerous diseases, including hereditary disorders caused by defects in genes encoding TRP channels (TRP channelopathies). Most TRP channels are located at the cell surface, which makes them generally accessible drug targets. Early drug discovery efforts to target TRP channels focused on pain, but as our knowledge of TRP channels and their role in health and disease has grown, these efforts have expanded into new clinical indications, ranging from respiratory disorders through neurological and psychiatric diseases to diabetes and cancer. In this Review, we discuss recent findings in TRP channel structural biology that can affect both drug development and clinical indications. We also discuss the clinical promise of novel TRP channel modulators, aimed at both established and emerging targets. Last, we address the challenges that these compounds may face in clinical practice, including the need for carefully targeted approaches to minimize potential side-effects due to the multifunctional roles of TRP channels.","Koivisto, Ari-Pekka; Belvisi, Maria G.; Gaudet, Rachelle; Szallasi, Arpad",Nat Rev Drug Discov,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41573-021-00268-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526696/,614
606491,CO2 WHEN Could a Second Wave of COVID-19 Appear in Germany and How Strong Will IT be? a Simulation Analysis,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, Rwanda launched a 5-year hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination plan as per the World Health Organization global targets to eliminate HCV by 2030. To improve awareness of HCV status, strategies are needed to ensure easy access to HCV testing by as-yet unreached populations. HCV-self-testing, an innovative strategy, could further increase HCV testing uptake. This assessment explores perceptions around HCV self-testing among members of the public and healthcare workers in Rwanda. METHODS: A qualitative study was undertaken in Masaka District Hospital, comprising individual interviews, group interviews and participatory action research (PAR) activities. Purposive and snowball sampling methods guided the selection of informants. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. A thematic analysis approach was used to analyse the findings. RESULTS: The participants comprised 36 members of the public and 36 healthcare workers. Informants appreciated HCV self-testing as an innovative means of increasing access to HCV testing, as well as an opportunity to test privately and subsequently autonomously decide whether to seek further HCV care. Informants further highlighted the need to make HCV self-testing services free of charge at the nearest health facility. Disadvantages identified included the lack of pre/post-test counselling, as well as the potential psychosocial harm which may result from the use of HCV self-testing. CONCLUSION: HCV self-testing is perceived to be an acceptable method to increase HCV testing in Rwanda. Further research is needed to assess the impact of HCV self-testing on HCV cascade of care outcomes.

In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we evaluated the association between IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 and the clinical outcome of bronchiolitis in pediatric patients. METHODS: A total of 682 infants suffering from bronchiolitis, categorized based on the final clinical outcome as mild or severe, were genotyped for IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917. RESULTS: When infants were categorized exclusively based on the final clinical outcome, no association was established between IL28B SNPs and the severity of bronchiolitis. However, when stratified by sex, the homozygotes for the minor alleles of rs12979860 (T) and rs8099917 (G) were associated with a mild disease in girls but not in boys. CONCLUSION: SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 correlate with the severity of bronchiolitis and display a sex bias, where GG rs8099917 and TT rs12979860 genotypes are associated with a mild disease in girls but not in boys.

We employ queueing theory to model the inflow and outflow of patients and validate the approach through extensive simulation on real demographic and epidemiological data from the boroughs of New York City.

It has been listed by the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) as an important target for vaccine development. While initially the majority of MERS cases were hospital acquired, continued emergence of MERS is attributed to community acquisition, with camels likely being the direct or indirect source. However, the majority of patients do not describe camel exposure, making the route of transmission unclear. Here, using sensitive immunological assays and a cohort of camel workers (CWs) with well-documented camel exposure, we show that approximately 50% of camel workers (CWs) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 0% of controls were previously infected. We obtained blood samples from 30 camel herders, truck drivers, and handlers with well-documented camel exposure and from healthy donors, and measured MERS-CoV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and neutralizing antibody titers, as well as T cell responses. Totals of 16/30 CWs and 0/30 healthy control donors were seropositive by MERS-CoV-specific ELISA and/or neutralizing antibody titer, and an additional four CWs were seronegative but contained virus-specific T cells in their blood. Although virus transmission from CWs has not been formally demonstrated, a possible explanation for repeated MERS outbreaks is that CWs develop mild disease and then transmit the virus to uninfected individuals.

Nonetheless, this is the first comparative study between the use of Foistar (Camostat mesilate) and Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) on COVID-19 infection. Methods Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that were admitted to Seoul Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) where is the largest public medical center in South Korea between August 1 and September 20, 2020 were included The data of the patients with pneumonia who received Foistar (Foistar group) during their hospitalization period were primarily collected, and the patients who received Kaletra (Kaletra group) during their hospitalization period were matched to have a similar age group to that of Foistar group so that three times the number of Foistar group patients were randomly selected into Kaletra group and their body temperature, CRP level, WBC count, and event of diarrhea were collected, accordingly. Results A total of 29 patients (7 Foistar group and 22 Kaletra group) was included. The median age was 69, and all had mild COVID-19 (WHO ordinal scale 3 or 4) on admission. 6 patients out of 7 patients (85.71%) from Foistar group who exhibited elevated CRP levels (CRP >0.4mg/dL) on admission have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range. In Kaletra group, 11 out of 18 patients (61.11%) have controlled their CRP levels to the normal range, and only 1 of 2 patients (50.00%) who had normal CRP level has maintained his or her normal CRP level. The difference in the white blood cell counts was not significant between two groups. None of the patients in the study had hyperkalemia. Conclusion This study has found a probable association of controlling inflammatory reactions and fever in COVID-19 patients with Foistar (camostat mesilate) use. In addition, there was no significant adverse drug event found from this study upon the Foistar use. These results may encourage the use of Foistar as a treatment option for the patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.","Choi, J.-P.; Kim, H.-J.; Han, J.; Park, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.10.20240689v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.10.20240689,614

But studies in non-human primates indicate that reinfection of recovered patients is highly unlikely. It is also clear that primary immune responses or induced immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 remain in circulation for several months and at least temporarily confer immunity to protect from reinfection. In addition, negative virus culture analysis of re-positive suggests that positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions in recovered patients are more likely to be false-positive, or detection of genetic remnants of virus discharged from lesions of lungs or better sampling at the time of repeat analysis. However, emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants are likely to be causing the infections observed in some of the recovered patients.","Shrestha, Rupendra; Shrestha, Reena; Khadka, Ram Bahadur; Gyawali, Rabin",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.5538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508515/,614

Notwithstanding limitations in accuracy and resolution of the data available from public sources, we pinpoint significant trends exploiting information in curves and shapes with Functional Data Analysis techniques. These depict two starkly different epidemics; an “exponential” one unfolding in Lombardia and the worst hit areas of the north, and a milder, “flat(tened)” one in the rest of the country—including Veneto, where cases appeared concurrently with Lombardia but aggressive testing was implemented early on. We find that mobility and positivity can predict COVID-19 mortality, also when controlling for relevant covariates. Among the latter, primary care appears to mitigate mortality, and contacts in hospitals, schools and workplaces to aggravate it. The techniques we describe could capture additional and potentially sharper signals if applied to richer data.","Boschi, Tobia; Di Iorio, Jacopo; Testa, Lorenzo; Cremona, Marzia A.; Chiaromonte, Francesca",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462450/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04700v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95866-y,614
609880,Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the profession and psychological wellbeing of radiologists: a nationwide online survey,2021-02-17,"CONTEXT: Over the course of March and April 2020, New York City experienced a surge of a hundred and seventy thousand COVID-19 cases, overwhelming hospital systems and leading to an unprecedented need for palliative care services. OBJECTIVES: To present a model for rapid palliative care workforce expansion under crisis conditions, utilizing supervised advanced psychiatry trainees to provide primary palliative services in the acute care and emergency setting. METHODS: In response to the New York City COVID-19 surge, advanced psychiatry trainees at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center were rapidly trained and redeployed to a newly formed psychiatry-palliative care liaison team. Under the supervision of consultation-liaison psychiatrists (who also served as team coordinators), these trainees provided circumscribed palliative care services to patients and/or their families, including goals of care discussions and psychosocial support. Palliative care attendings remained available to all team members for more advanced, specialized supervision. RESULTS: The psychiatry-palliative care liaison team effectively provided palliative care services during the early phase and peak of New York City’s COVID-19 crisis, managing up to 16 new cases per day and provided longitudinal follow-up, thereby enabling palliative care specialists to focus on providing services requiring specialist-level palliative care expertise. CONCLUSION: By training and supervising psychiatrists and advanced psychiatry trainees in specific palliative care roles, palliative care teams could more effectively meet markedly increased service needs of varying complexity during the COVID-19 crisis. As new geographic regions experience possible COVID-19 surges in the coming months, this may serve as a model for rapidly increasing palliative care workforce.","Shalev, Daniel; Nakagawa, Shunichi; Stroeh, Oliver M.; Arbuckle, Melissa R.; Rendleman, Rebecca; Blinderman, Craig D.; Shapiro, Peter A.",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420304413; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.06.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32544648/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420304413?v=s5,614

People’s social behavior, reflected in their mobility data, plays a major role in spreading the disease. Therefore, we used the daily mobility data aggregated at the county level beside COVID-19 statistics and demographic information for short-term forecasting of COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States. The daily data are fed to a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the next two weeks. A significant average correlation was achieved (r=0.83 (p = 0.005)) between the model predicted and actual accumulated cases in the interval from August 1, 2020 until January 22, 2021. The model predictions had r > 0.7 for 87% of the counties across the United States. A lower correlation was reported for the counties with total cases of <1000 during the test interval. The average mean absolute error (MAE) was 605.4 and decreased with a decrease in the total number of cases during the testing interval. The model was able to capture the effect of government responses on COVID-19 cases. Also, it was able to capture the effect of age demographics on the COVID-19 spread. It showed that the average daily cases decreased with a decrease in the retiree percentage and increased with an increase in the young percentage.

Rapid pathogen detection, which is efficient and convenient, is the best approach for early confirmatory diagnosis. In this study, we first developed and evaluated a rapid recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) detection method for FCoV that can detect FCoV within 15 min at 39°C. The detection limit of that assay was 233 copies/μL DNA molecules per reaction. The specificity was high: it did not cross-react with canine distemper virus (CDV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), canine adenovirus (CAV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus (FHV), or feline parvovirus (FPV). This assay was evaluated using 42 clinical samples (30 diarrhea samples and 12 ascites samples). The coincidence rate between FCoV-RPA and RT-qPCR for detection in clinical samples was 95.2%.

Prevalent cancer cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2019 were linked with the provincial COVID‐19 surveillance system. We compared CS' cumulative incidence of being tested, testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), being hospitalized and dying of COVID‐19 with that of the general population; we compared COVID‐19 prognosis in CS and in patients without cancer. During the study period, 15 391 people (1527 CS) underwent real‐time polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV‐2, of whom 4541 (447 CS) tested positive; 541 (113 CS) died of COVID‐19. CS had higher age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of testing (1.28 [95% confidence interval, CI = 1.21‐1.35]), of positive test (IRR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.96‐1.18]) and of hospitalization and death (IRR 1.27 [95% CI = 1.09‐1.48] and 1.39 [95%CI = 1.12‐1.71], respectively). CS had worse prognosis when diagnosed with COVID‐19, particularly those below age 70 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of death 5.03; [95% CI = 2.59‐9.75]), while the OR decreased after age 70. The OR of death was higher for CS with a recent diagnosis, that is, <2 years (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.64‐5.21), or metastases (OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 0.88‐4.93).

611153,Guidelines and recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic: A word of caution,2020-06-06,"Mexico has experienced one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates in the world. A delayed implementation of social distancing interventions in late March 2020 and a phased reopening of the country in June 2020 has facilitated sustained disease transmission in the region. In this study we systematically generate and compare 30-day ahead forecasts using previously validated growth models based on mortality trends from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for Mexico and Mexico City in near real-time. Moreover, we estimate reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 based on the methods that rely on genomic data as well as case incidence data. Subsequently, functional data analysis techniques are utilized to analyze the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the state level to characterize the spatiotemporal transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2. The early estimates of the reproduction number for Mexico were estimated between R(t) ~1.1–1.3 from the genomic and case incidence data. Moreover, the mean estimate of R(t) has fluctuated around ~1.0 from late July till end of September 2020. The spatial analysis characterizes the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 into four groups with distinct epidemic trajectories based on epidemic growth rates. Our results show that the sequential mortality forecasts from the GLM and Richards model predict a downward trend in the number of deaths for all thirteen forecast periods for Mexico and Mexico City. However, the sub-epidemic and IHME models perform better predicting a more realistic stable trajectory of COVID-19 mortality trends for the last three forecast periods (09/21-10/21, 09/28-10/27, 09/28-10/27) for Mexico and Mexico City. Our findings indicate that phenomenological models are useful tools for short-term epidemic forecasting albeit forecasts need to be interpreted with caution given the dynamic implementation and lifting of social distancing measures.","Tariq, Amna; Banda, Juan M.; Skums, Pavel; Dahal, Sushma; Castillo-Garsow, Carlos; Espinoza, Baltazar; Brizuela, Noel G.; Saenz, Roberto A.; Kirpich, Alexander; Luo, Ruiyan; Srivastava, Anuj; Gutierrez, Humberto; Chan, Nestor Garcia; Bento, Ana I.; Jimenez-Corona, Maria-Eugenia; Chowell, Gerardo",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288969/,614

So, the need for a novel approach or model to overcome the problem becomes a necessity. In this paper, a mechanism is proposed called DBCMS (Drone Based Covid-19 Medical Service) for the safety of medical employees who are prone to Covid-19 infection. The proposed mechanism can effectively improve the treatment process of Covid-19 patients. Drones are nowadays commonly used in the field of medical emergency situations. The proposed model in this paper uses drone service to reduce the risk of infection to the doctors or other medical staff, thereby preventing the disease spread. This paper further assumes that the primary step is to isolate people at their home instead of admitting them to the hospitals, also called a situation of lockdown or curfew. Thus, in this way, the spread can be significantly reduced across the globe if DBCMS approach is implemented at cluster level.","Angurala, Mohit; Bala, Manju; Bamber, Sukhvinder Singh; Kaur, Rajbir; Singh, Prabhdeep",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666449620300116; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666449620300116?v=s5,614
611289,"Covid-19, anxiety, and anxiety-related disorders",2021-05-25,"SARS‐CoV‐2 remains a prominent threat to human lives despite the recent approval of vaccines and antibodies across the world. There is also a growing concern of mutations in the virus that demand effective strategies to combat infection. SARS‐CoV‐2 infects cells via its surface Spike glycoprotein (SgP), a homo‐trimeric assembly of S1 and S2 subunits, that binds to cell surface angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thereby gaining viral entry. SgP also utilizes the cell surface bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to enhance the efficiency of viral entry. The receptor‐binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit interacts with both the ACE2 receptor as well as the heparan sulfate (HS) chains of HSPGs. HS is a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that has been recognized as a crucial factor in the infectivity of numerous viruses. Our early work suggested that of the numerous structural possibilities, 3‐O‐sulfated (3‐OS) sequences of HS may be involved in better recognition of SgP (bioRxiv (2020) DOI:10.1101/2020.10.08.331751). Large‐scale computational analysis based on our in‐house developed genetic algorithm‐based dual filtering strategy indicated that HS more favorably interacts with the RBD compared to other electropositive regions in the SgP trimer. The results suggested that the RBD of SgP prefers to recognize optimal three‐dimensional factors governed by chain length and sulfation pattern of HS sequences. Microarray screening of 24 distinct HS sequences against the S1 and RBD domains resulted in only eight sequences displaying reasonable affinity for the RBD, which were significantly weaker for the S1 subunit. Of these, two containing 3‐O­S sequences exhibited some of the highest signals on the array. Competition studies using the same microarray in the presence of fondaparinux (a 3‐OS‐containing pentasaccharide) and HS06 (a non‐3‐OS variant of a HS hexasaccharide) led to the observation that HS06 is a more efficient competitor than fondaparinux. Advanced computational experiments indicated that RBD tends to bind more effectively with 3‐OS‐containing HS chains when more than one 3‐OS groups is present. In conclusion, our work provides additional insight into the structural requirements within HS for mediating efficient viral entry, while also offering new avenues for developing potential inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Chittum, John; Sankaranarayanan, Nehru; O'Hara, Connor; Desai, Umesh",FASEB J,https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.s1.01674,614

The microparticles are formed into chain-like microstructures in both the pure magnetic fluid and the inverse magnetic fluid by applying the external magnetic field. The fluorescence parameters of these self-assembled chain-like microstructures are measured and compared to those without the effect of magnetic field. It is found that the fluorescence in the pure magnetic fluid is weakened, because the scattering and illuminating areas are reduced in the microstructures. On the contrary, the fluorescence in the inverse magnetic fluid is enhanced, because more fluorescent nonmagnetic microparticles are enriched and become detectable under the effect of the magnetic dipole force and the magnetic levitational force, and their unnecessary scattering can be absorbed by the surrounding ferrofluid. The average enhancement of the fluorescence area ratio in the inverse magnetic fluid with 3 μm nonmagnetic microparticles reaches 112.92%. The present work shows that the inverse magnetic fluid has advantages such as low cost, no scattering effect, stable fluorescence intensity, and relatively low magnetic resistance. In the end, a prototype design for the novel detection of coronavirus disease 2019 based on the magnetic field induced self-assembly in the inverse magnetic fluid is proposed, which could support the epidemic prevention and control.","Li, Xiang; Dong, Zhi-Qiang; Yu, Peng; Wang, Lian-Ping; Niu, Xiao-Dong; Yamaguchi, Hiroshi; Li, De-Cai",Phys Fluids (1994),https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0048123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897247/,614

In this study, we present a simple and practical strategy to address these problems by conjugating ENF with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Site-specific attachment of a 2 kDa PEG at the N-terminus of ENF resulted in an ENF−PEG (EP) conjugate with high solubility (≥3 mg/mL) and long half-life in rats (T(1/2) = 16.1 h). This conjugate showed similar antiviral activity to ENF against various primary HIV-1 isolates (EC(50) = 6–91 nM). Mechanistic studies suggested the sources of the antiviral potency. The conjugate bound to a functional domain of the HIV gp41 protein in a helical conformation with high affinity (K(d) = 307 nM), thereby inhibiting the gp41-mediated fusion of viral and host-cell membranes. As PEG conjugation has advanced many bioactive proteins and peptides into clinical applications, the EP conjugate described here represents a potential new treatment for HIV infections that may address the unmet medical needs associated with the current ENF therapy.","Cheng, Shuihong; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Zhenxing; Lv, Xun; Gao, George F.; Shao, Yiming; Ma, Liying; Li, Xuebing",Eur J Med Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523416304159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240277/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.05.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523416304159,614

This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, several of them use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these nucleic-acid-based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, suggesting that a suitable RBD construct might serve as a more accessible vaccine ingredient. We describe a monomeric, glycan-engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 214 mg/l in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and, in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100 °C when lyophilized, up to 70 °C in solution and stable for over 4 weeks at 37 °C. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59-like adjuvant AddaVax, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ∼415 against replicative virus, comparing favorably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic.

612606,Determinants of Postponed Cancer Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from the Nationally Representative COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring in Germany (COSMO),2021-07-14,"Background Effective antiviral treatments are required to contain the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A previous report in 814 patients COVID-19 positive in Cuba provided preliminary therapeutic efficacy evidence with interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) from March 11 to April 14, 2020. This study, re-evaluates the contribution of IFN-2b on the evolution of all patients, after 98 days of the epidemic, in a period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. Method A prospective observational study was implemented to monitor a therapeutic intervention with IFN alpha-2b used in the national protocol for COVID-19 attending in Cuba. Were included patients with positive throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN alpha-2b The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital, secondary was the case fatality rate and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. Results From March 11th until June 17th, 2295 patients had been confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 2165 were treated with Heberon Alpha R and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. The benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed. Conclusions This second report confirm the preliminary evidences from first for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN alpha-2b for SARS-Cov-2 infection and postulated that Heberon Alpha R is the main component within the antiviral triad used as a therapeutic intervention in the Cuban protocol COVID-19.","Pereda, R.; Gonzalez, D.; Rivero, H.

612651,The PanSurg-PREDICT Study: Endocrine Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-04-20,"Unstructured Abstract The use of biphasic cuirass ventilator supported radiotherapy has never been documented. We present the first technical report here. A 57-year-old man with obstructive sleep apnea presented with a T0N1M0 right sided, human papillomavirus related head and neck cancer diagnosed with excisional lymph node biopsy. On further work-up, the cancer was found to originate in the right tonsil and was staged as T1N1. The patient started definitive treatment with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, but after 5 treatments, was no longer able to lay in a supine position for treatment. Diagnostic imaging work-up eventually revealed an idiopathic right sided hemi-diaphragm eventration. After consultation with cardiology, pulmonology and head and neck surgery, recommendation was made for tracheostomy in order to tolerate supine radiotherapy position, but the patient refused. Instead, CT simulation for radiotherapy re-planning was performed using a combination of biphasic cuirass ventilation, home continuous positive airway pressure and oxygen. The patient then tolerated definitive treatment to a dose of 69.96 Gray in 33 fractions with concurrent chemotherapy, with no unexpected side effects. Although complex, daily treatment set-up was consistent. Daily onboard imaging was precise and accurate. The patient continues to follow-up with radiation oncology, medical oncology and pulmonology. This is the first use of biphasic cuirass ventilator supported radiotherapy reported in the scientific literature. Although daily treatment set-up is complex, its use could be considered in patients unable to tolerate radiotherapy treatment positioning as an alternative to tracheostomy.","Clinkscales, William; Spence, Matthew; Gleysteen, John; Hayes, Neil; Izaguirre, Enrique; Wakefield, Daniel; Schwartz, David; Rhea, Isaac; Risquez, Cristobal; Sharma, Ankur",Pract Radiat Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2020.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187985002030206X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187985002030206X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32828918/,614

613304,Professional quality of life and caring behaviours among clinical nurses during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2021-07-06,"Implicit (‘unconscious’) approach–avoidance tendencies towards stimuli can be measured using the Approach Avoidance Task (AAT). We recently expanded a toolbox for analyzing the raw data of a novel, mobile version of the AAT (mAAT), that asks participants to move their phone towards their face (pull) or away (push) in response to images presented on the phone. We here tested the mAAT reaction time and the mAAT distance in a study with 71 Dutch participants that were recruited online and performed an experiment without coming to the laboratory. The participants used both the mAAT and (explicit) rating scales to respond to photographic images of food. As hypothesized, the rated wanting, rated valence and mAAT reaction time indicated a preference for palatable over unpalatable food, and for Dutch over Asian food. Additionally, as expected, arousal was rated higher for unpalatable than for palatable food, and higher for Dutch than for Asian food. The mAAT distance indicated that the unpalatable food images were moved across larger distances, regardless of the movement direction (pull or push), compared to the palatable food images; and the Dutch food images were moved across larger distances than the Asian food images. We conclude that the mAAT can be used to implicitly probe approach–avoidance motivation for complex images in the food domain. The new measure of mAAT distance may be used as an implicit measure of arousal. The ratings and the mAAT measures do not reflect the exact same information and may complement each other. Implicit measures, such as mAAT variables, are particularly valuable when response biases that can occur when using explicit ratings are expected.","Brouwer, Anne-Marie; van Beers, Jasper J.; Sabu, Priya; Stuldreher, Ivo V.; Zech, Hilmar G.; Kaneko, Daisuke",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206278/; https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10071440,614

PredictProtein was the first Internet server for protein predictions. It pioneered combining evolutionary information and machine learning. Given a protein sequence as input, the server outputs multiple sequence alignments, predictions of protein structure in 1D and 2D (secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane segments, disordered regions, protein flexibility, and disulfide bridges) and predictions of protein function (functional effects of sequence variation or point mutations, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, subcellular localization, and protein-, RNA-, and DNA binding). PredictProtein's infrastructure has moved to the LCSB increasing throughput; the use of MMseqs2 sequence search reduced runtime five-fold (apparently without lowering performance of prediction methods); user interface elements improved usability, and new prediction methods were added. PredictProtein recently included predictions from deep learning embeddings (GO and secondary structure) and a method for the prediction of proteins and residues binding DNA, RNA, or other proteins. PredictProtein.org aspires to provide reliable predictions to computational and experimental biologists alike.

614288,Non-evidenced based treatment: An unintended cause of morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19,2020-05-06,"Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure in patients with COVID-19. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells were screened to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial activation. It was found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Remarkablely, though the protein sequences of N proteins from coronaviruses are highly conserved, only NP from SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial activation. The NPs from other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HUB1-CoV and influenza virus H1N1 did not activate endothelial cells. These findings are well consistent with the results from clinical investigations showing broad endotheliitis and organ injury in severe COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide challenge for health-care systems. The leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 is hypoxic respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) have been largely overlooked as a therapeutic target in COVID-19, yet emerging evidence suggests that these cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing vascular inflammation and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a better mechanistic understanding of the vasculature is of utmost importance. In this study, we screened the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that potently activate human endothelial cells and found that nucleocapsid protein (NP) significantly activated human endothelial cells through TLR2/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, by screening a natural microbial compound library containing 154 natural compounds, simvastatin was identified as a potent inhibitor of NP-induced endothelial activation. Our results provide insights on SARS-CoV-2-induced vasculopathy and coagulopathy, and suggests that simvastatin, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, may benefit to prevent the pathogenesis and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients.","Qian, Yisong; Lei, Tianhua; Patel, Parth S; Lee, Chi H; Monaghan-Nichols, Paula; Xin, Hong-Bo; Qiu, Jianming; Fu, Mingui",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01396-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549987/,614

METHODS: The prevalence of birth defects in perinatal infants delivered after 28 weeks or more was analyzed in Hubei surveillance hospitals during 200l–2008. RESULTS: The incidence of birth defects in perinatal infants from 200l to 2008 was 120.0 per 10,000 births, and was increased by about 41% from 81. 1 in 2001 to 138.5 per 10,000 births in 2008. The incidence in the first 4 years (2005–2008) was much higher than the latter four (2001–2004) (χ(2)=77.64, P <0.05). The difference in prevalence between urban and rural was of no significance in 2008 (χ(2)=0.03, P >0.05), but that between male and female was significant (χ(2)=5.24, P <0.05), as the former prevalence was much higher. The prevalence of birth defects was slightly higher among mothers over 35 years old than those under 35 years old, but with no significance (χ(2)=1.98, P >0.05). The two leading birth defects were cleft lip and/or palate and polydactyly, followed by congenital heart disease, hydrocephaly, external ear malformation and neural tube defects. The prevalence of congenital heart disease was rising.

We examined characteristics of individuals who died from COVID-19 in Michigan by race stratified by their age, sex and comorbidity prevalence to illustrate and understand this disparity in mortality risk. METHODS: We evaluate COVID-19 mortality in Michigan by demographic and health characteristics, using individual-level linked death certificate and surveillance data collected by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services from March 16 to October 26, 2020. We identified differences in demographics and comorbidity prevalence across race among individuals who died from COVID-19 and calculated mortality rates by age, sex, race, and number of comorbidities. FINDINGS: Among the 6,065 COVID-19 related deaths in Michigan, Black individuals are experiencing 3·6 times the mortality rate of White individuals (p<0.001), with a mortality rate for Black individuals under 65 years without comorbidities that is 12·6 times that of their White counterparts (p<0.001). After accounting for age, race, sex, and number of comorbidities, we find that Black individuals in all strata are at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality than their White counterparts. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that Black populations are disproportionately burdened by COVID-19 mortality, even after accounting for demographic and underlying health characteristics.

Drastic lifestyle changes, social isolation and distancing, and individual and global financial crises resulted in robust populations forfeiting healthy habits and seeking comfort in alcoholic beverages, drugs and unhealthy diets. The inevitable consequences are increases in the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, acute alcoholic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis decompensation and ultimately liver-related mortality. The inaccessibility of regular clinical and sonographic monitoring systems has caused difficulties in the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) and has prevented prompt hepatocellular carcinoma detection and treatment. A dramatic reduction in the number of liver donors and the transformation of numerous transplantation centers into COVID-19 units drastically decreased the rate of orthotopic liver transplantation. The indirect, unavoidable effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the following years have yet to be determined. Substantial efforts in the management of patients with liver disease in order to overcome the inevitable COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality that will follow have yet to be initiated. Several questions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver disease remain. The most important question for general CLD patients is: How will the modification of clinical practice during this pandemic affect the outcomes of CLD patients?

Disease severity and mortality rates are higher in patients with underlying diabetes mellitus. Till date, there exists no effective vaccine or therapy against COVID-19. However, with limited clinical data, HCQ is being used for treatment and prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19. HCQ is also used as an anti-diabetic drug and has been approved in India as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on metformin and sulfonylurea combination in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Thus, although indiscriminate use of HCQ is fraught with danger, HCQ can be considered as a third-line add on anti-diabetic agent in people with T2DM amid the ongoing pandemic after having ruled out the contraindications to the use of this drug.","Pal, Rimesh; Bhasin, Manoj K; Bhadada, Sanjay K",Infect Disord Drug Targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526520666201013160803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050869/,614

Retrospective study in a specialized pedodontic center,2021,"People with obesity commonly face a pervasive, resilient form of social stigma. They are often subject to discrimination in the workplace as well as in educational and healthcare settings. Research indicates that weight stigma can cause physical and psychological harm, and that affected individuals are less likely to receive adequate care. For these reasons, weight stigma damages health, undermines human and social rights, and is unacceptable in modern societies. To inform healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public about this issue, a multidisciplinary group of international experts, including representatives of scientific organizations, reviewed available evidence on the causes and harms of weight stigma and, using a modified Delphi process, developed a joint consensus statement with recommendations to eliminate weight bias. Academic institutions, professional organizations, media, public-health authorities, and governments should encourage education about weight stigma to facilitate a new public narrative about obesity, coherent with modern scientific knowledge.","Rubino, Francesco; Puhl, Rebecca M.; Cummings, David E.; Eckel, Robert H.; Ryan, Donna H.; Mechanick, Jeffrey I.; Nadglowski, Joe; Ramos Salas, Ximena; Schauer, Phillip R.; Twenefour, Douglas; Apovian, Caroline M.; Aronne, Louis J.; Batterham, Rachel L.; Berthoud, Hans-Rudolph; Boza, Camilo; Busetto, Luca; Dicker, Dror; De Groot, Mary; Eisenberg, Daniel; Flint, Stuart W.; Huang, Terry T.; Kaplan, Lee M.; Kirwan, John P.; Korner, Judith; Kyle, Ted K.; Laferrère, Blandine; le Roux, Carel W.; McIver, LaShawn; Mingrone, Geltrude; Nece, Patricia; Reid, Tirissa J.; Rogers, Ann M.; Rosenbaum, Michael; Seeley, Randy J.; Torres, Antonio J.; Dixon, John B.",Nat Med,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0803-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32127716/,614

Over recent years, the question of concrete mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory properties of bifidobacteria has been addressed in both animal and human studies. A possible candidate for this role has been discovered recently. The PFNA cluster, consisting of five core genes, pkb2, fn3, aaa-atp, duf58, tgm, has been found in all gut-dwelling autochthonous bifidobacterial species of humans. The sensory region of the species-specific serine-threonine protein kinase (PKB2), the transmembrane region of the microbial transglutaminase (TGM), and the type-III fibronectin domain-containing protein (FN3) encoded by the I gene imply that the PFNA cluster might be implicated in the interaction between bacteria and the host immune system. Moreover, the FN3 protein encoded by one of the genes making up the PFNA cluster, contains domains and motifs of cytokine receptors capable of selectively binding TNF-α. The PFNA cluster could play an important role for sensing signals of the immune system. Among the practical implications of this finding is the creation of anti-inflammatory drugs aimed at alleviating cytokine storms, one of the dire consequences resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nezametdinova, Venera Z.; Yunes, Roman A.; Dukhinova, Marina S.; Alekseeva, Maria G.; Danilenko, Valery N.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502130/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179219,614

Methods This was a multinational retrospective cohort study including women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 from 76 centers from 25 different countries in Europe, United States, South America, Asia and Australia from 04 April 2020 till 28 October 2020. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity including admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome, including miscarriage, fetal loss, neonatal (NND) and perinatal (PND) death, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit. All these outcomes were assessed in high-risk compared to low-risk pregnancies. Pregnancies were considered as high risk in case of either pre-existing chronic medical conditions pre-existing pregnancy or obstetric disorders occurring in pregnancy. Fisher-test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. Results 887 singleton pregnancies tested positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR nasal and pharyngeal swab were included in the study. The risk of composite adverse maternal outcome was higher in high compared to low risk-pregnancies with an OR of 1.52 (95% CU 1.03-2.24; p= 0.035). Likewise, women carrying a high risk-pregnancies were also at higher risk of hospital admission (OR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.04; p= 0.002), presence of severe respiratory symptoms (OR: 2.13, 95% CI .41-3.21; p= 0.001), admission to ICU (OR: 2.63, 95% CI 1.42-4.88) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.65, 95% CI 1.19- 5.94; p= .002). When exploring perinatal outcomes, high-risk pregnancies were also at high risk of adverse perinatal outcome with an OR 0f 1.78 (95% CI .15-2.72; p= 0.009). However, such association was mainly due to the higher incidence of miscarriage in high risk compared to low risk pregnancies (5.3% vs 1.6%, p= 0.008), while there was no difference as regard as the other explored outcomes between the two study groups. At logistic regression analysis, maternal age (OR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, p= 0.023) and the presence of a high-risk pregnancies (OR: 4.21, 95% CI 3.90-5.11, p<0.001) were independently associated with adverse maternal outcome. Conclusions High-risk pregnancies complicated by SARS-COV-2 infection are at higher risk of adverse maternal outcome compared to low-risk gestations.","D'Antonio, Francesco; Sen, Cihat; Mascio, Daniele DI; Galindo, Alberto; Villalain, Cecilia; Herraiz, Ignacio; Arısoy, Resul; Ovayolu, Ali; Eroğlu, Hasan; Canales, Manuel Guerra; Ladella, Subhashini; Cojocaru, Liviu; Turan, Ozhan; Turan, Sifa; Hadar, Eran; Brzezinski-Sinai, Noa A.; Dollinger, Sarah; Uyaniklar, Ozlem; Ocakouglu, Sakine Rahimli; Atak, Zeliha; Premru-Srsen, Tanja; Kornhauser-Cerar, Lilijana; Druškovič, Mirjam; Ples, Liana; Gündüz, Reyhan; Ağaçayak, Elif; Schvartzman, Javier Alfonso; Malbran, Mercedes Negri; Liberati, Marco; Sebastiano, Francesca Di; Oronzi, Ludovica; Cerra, Chiara; Buca, Danilo; Cagnacci, Angelo; Ramone, Arianna; Barra, Fabio; Carosso, Andrea; Benedetto, Chiara; Cosma, Stefano; Pintiaux, Axelle; Daelemans, Caroline; Costa, Elena; Özel, Ayşegül; Muhçu, Murat; Jimenez Lopez, Jesús S; Alvarado, Clara; Piqueras, Anna Luengo; Oliva, Dolores Esteban; Schera, Giovanni Battista Luca; Volpe, Nicola; Frusca, Tiziana; Samardjiski, Igor; Simeonova, Slagjana; Papestiev, Irena Aleksioska; Hojman, Javier; Turkcuoglu, Ilgin; Cromi, Antonella; Laganà, Antonio Simone; Ghezzi, Fabio; Sirico, Angelo; Familiari, Alessandra; Scambia, Giovanni; Sukhikh, Zulfiya Khodjaeva Gennady T.; Gorina, Ksenia A.; de Sa, Renato Augusto Moreira; Vaz, Mariana; Feuerschuette, Otto Henrique May; Gatta, Anna Nunzia Della; Youssef, Aly; Donna, Gaetana Di; Martinez-Varea, Alicia; Loscalzo, Gabriela; Roselló, José Morales; Stefanovic, Vedran; Nupponen, Irmeli; Nelskylä, Kaisa; Ayala, Rodrigo; Molpeceres, Rebeca Garrote; Vázquez, Asunción Pino; Sandri, Fabrizio; Cataneo, Ilaria; Lenzi, Marinella; Haberal, Esra Tustas; Huertas, Erasmo; Sanchez, Amadeo; Arango, Pedro; Bermejo, Amanda; Alcantara, María Monica Gonzalez; Göynümer, Gökhan; Okuyan, Erhan; Madalina, Ciuhodaru; Guisan, Ana Concheiro; Schulte, Alejandra Martínez; Esposito, Valentina; De Robertis, Valentina; Zdjelar, Snezana; Lackovic, Milan; Mihajlovic, Sladjana; Jekova, Nelly; Saccone, Gabriele; Aslan, Mehmet Musa; Dedda, Maria Carmela Di; Chalid, Maisuri; Canache, Jose Enrique Moros; Daskalakis, George; Antsaklis, Panos; Vega, Enrique Criado; Cueto, Elisa; Taccaliti, Chiara; Aykanat, Alicia Yeliz; Özlem Genç, Şerife; Froessler, Bernd; Radulova, Petya Angelova; Morano, Danila; Bianchi, Beatrice; Marino, Maria Giulia Lombana; Meccariello, Gabriella; Rohatgi, Bindu; Schiattarella, Antonio; Morlando, Maddalena; Colacurci, Nicola; Villasco, Andrea; Biglia, Nicoletta; Marques, Ana Luiza Santos; Gatti, Alessandra; Luvero, Daniela; Angioli, Roberto; Pittaro, Alejandro; Lila, Albert; Zlatohlávková, Blanka",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589933321000240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33621713/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933321000240?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100329,614

619491,"The COVID-19 pandemic: How predictive analysis, artificial intelligence and GIS can be integrated into a clinical command system to improve disaster response and preparedness()",2020-11-02,"Abstract Cities play an important role in fostering and amplifying the transmission of airborne diseases (e.g., influenza) because of dense human contacts. Before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city, how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown. This research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns, because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement. Previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (e.g., city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement. This article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of Portland, Oregon. To achieve this goal, we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies, and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies based on geo-social interaction patterns in containing the epidemic outbreak at the source. This research can provide evidence to inform public health approaches to determine effective scales in the design of disease control strategies.","Luo, Wei; Gao, Peng; Cassels, Susan","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198971517303551; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971517303551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30983651/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.06.008,614

To characterize pre-hospital cardiac arrest careduring COVID-19 in Detroit, we analyzed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) rate of ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) and patient characteristics before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: OHCA data was analyzed between March 10th, 2020 – April 30th,2020 and March 10th, 2019 – April 30th,2019. ROSC, patient demographics, arrest location, initial rhythms, bystander CPR and field termination were compared before and during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare arrest characteristics between years, and the odds of achieving vs. not achieving ROSC. 2020 vs. 2019 as a predictor for ROSC was assessed with logistic regression. RESULTS: 471 patients were included. Arrests increased to 291 during the pandemic vs. 180 in 2019 (62% increase). Age (mean difference + 6; 95% CI: +2.4 to +9.5), arrest location (nursing home OR = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.42–4.31; public place OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.25–0.88), BLS response (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47–0.99), and field termination of resuscitation (OR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.36–4.07) differed significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. No significant difference was found in the confounder-adjusted odds of ROSC in 2020 vs 2019 (OR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.34–1.11). CONCLUSION: OHCA increased by 62% during COVID-19 in Detroit, without a significant change in prehospital ROSC. The rate of ROSC remained similar despite the implementation of an early termination of resuscitation protocol in response to COVID-19.","Mathew, Shobi; Harrison, Nicholas; Chalek, Adam D.; Gorelick, Damon; Brennan, Erin; Wise, Stefanie; Gandolfo, Lauren; O'Neil, Brian; Dunne, Robert",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740572/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721002102?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721002102; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.03.025,614
621262,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Patient’s Decision about Bariatric Surgery: Results of a National Survey,2021-07-26,"OBJECTIVE: Real-time locating systems (RTLS) enable contact tracing and hand hygiene reminders, to improve hospital safety. Successful implementation requires healthcare personnel (HCP) to carry RTLS tags continuously. We assessed for determinants of HCP’s willingness to use RTLS tags during routine inpatient care, and evaluated concerns using mixed-methods analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the 330-bed purpose-built National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore, from January 15 through February 4, 2020. The anonymous survey comprised 24 questions based on constructs from behavioral models and an open-ended question. Principal component analysis was performed to derive the latent factor structure applied in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Concerns were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of 260 HCP (nurses [40.8%], ancillary and administrative staff [23.1%], allied health professionals [18.5%], and physicians [17.7%]), 75% were willing to use the RTLS tag. After adjusting for age, gender, healthcare professional group, and duration of practice, the acceptance of the use of the RTLS tag (adjusted OR 11.28 [95% CI 4.39–29.00], P < .001) was highly associated with the willingness to use the RTLS tag. HCP who perceived the tag to be easy to use (adjusted OR 2.80 [95% CI 1.37–5.72], P = .005), were also more willing to use the tag. HCP were willing to carry the RTLS tag for the purpose of contact tracing despite privacy concerns. CONCLUSION: More communications on the intentions and data protection standards of the RTLS, and accessory enhancements for HCP’s convenient and sustained use of the RTLS tag are crucial, to optimize RTLS’s usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Huiling; Huang, Zhilian; Yeo, Jeanette Y P; Wang, Yinchu; Chow, Angela",JAMIA Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505000/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaa072,614

621763,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Screening in the U.S.,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Migrants globally, including refugees and asylum seekers, have experienced adverse clinical and socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For approximately 56,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) and Reception Sites (RS) in Greece, living in severely substandard living conditions, prevention measures have been impossible with limited provision in terms of routine testing, surveillance, and access to healthcare. These migrant populations have experienced prolonged lockdowns and restricted movement since the pandemic began. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on refugees and asylum seekers in reception facilities in Greece and explore implications for policy and practice. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of policy documents and national surveillance data was conducted to identify COVID-19 outbreaks and estimate incidence among asylum seekers and refugees residing in these camps during the first 9 months of the epidemic in Greece (26th February – 15th November 2020). Incidence proportion (IP) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was calculated for three population groups (refugees and asylum seekers in RICs, refugees and asylum seekers in RSs, and the general population in Greece) during three time periods (first wave, second wave, and overall across the 9-month period). FINDINGS: Twenty-five COVID-19 outbreaks were identified in refugee and asylum seeker reception facilities, with 6 (85.7%) of 7 RICs and 18 (56.3%) of 32 RSs reporting at least one outbreak during the study period. The overall 9-month COVID-19 IP among refugee and asylum seeker populations residing in RSs on the Greek mainland was 1758 cases per 100,000 population; in RICs the incidence was 2052 cases per 100,000 population. Compared to the general population the risk of COVID-19 infection among refugees and asylum seekers in reception facilities was 2.5 to 3 times higher (p-value<0.001). The risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was higher among refugee and asylum seeker populations in RSs on the Greek mainland (IP ratio: 2.45; 95% CI: 2.25–2.68) but higher still among refugee and asylum seeker populations in RICs in the Greek islands and the land border with Turkey (IP ratio: 2.86; 95% CI: 2.64–3.10), where living conditions are particularly poor. INTERPRETATION: We identified high levels of COVID-19 transmission among refugees and asylum seekers in reception facilities in Greece. The risk of COVID-19 infection among these enclosed population groups has been significantly higher than the general population of Greece, and risk increases as living conditions deteriorate. These data have immediate implications for policy and practice. Strategies are now needed to ensure refugee and asylum seeker populations are included in national response plans to reduce transmission in at-risk groups for COVID-19, alongside inclusion in plans for COVID-19 vaccine roll out.","Kondilis, Elias; Papamichail, Dimitris; McCann, Sophie; Carruthers, Elspeth; Veizis, Apostolos; Orcutt, Miriam; Hargreaves, Sally",EClinicalMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258570/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100958,614

622360,Non communicable diseases persist despite being overshadowed by Covid-19 globally,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND: In Egypt, several infectious diseases of zoonotic origin have emerged in recent years like H1N1, MERSCoV and H5N1, the latter now endemic. Responding to these diseases requires a workforce trained in multi-disciplinary approaches to zoonotic disease research and control. It is difficult to deliver multidisciplinary and one health training globally because of the limited number of higher education programs that support such training. In low and middle-income countries where the impacts of emerging zoonotic diseases are felt more directly there is enthusiasm for such training and the use of e-technology can foster international, long-term collaborations. OBJECTIVES: To provide health training for infectious diseases research and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration. METHODS: We designed and simultaneously held two training workshops, one focused on pediatric infectious diseases and another on emerging infectious diseases to meet the objective. Both workshops had pre- and post-workshop activities for multi-disciplinary methods with an emphasis on the use of mobile technologies to enhance emerging infectious diseases surveillance and research for public health professionals in Egypt. Faculty and scientists from all universities in Egypt and from the National Research Center were invited to participate. RESULTS: 85 participants attended, 31 abstracts were submitted, and over a 3 year period 3 international grant applications were submitted, and 4 abstracts were presented at international conferences. An online forum was developed to continue building collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: Interactive on-site workshops are suitable for providing multi-disciplinary training for disease surveillance, research and disease control. Participants shared the opinion that grant proposal and scientific manuscript writing were important skills that they felt they did not have. Long term investments in workshops of this nature are needed to build upon the excitement generated by these activities.","Roess, Amira; Lahm, Sally; Kabbash, Ibrahim; Saad-Hussein, Amal; Shaalan, Ashraf; Rasslan, Ossama; Mohamed, Mohamed",Annals of global health,https://doi.org/10.29024/aogh.2372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779513/,614

Several nanobodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, we identified an extended network of pairwise interactions between RBD and nanobodies H11-H4, H11-D4, and Ty1 by performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Simulations of the nanobody-RBD-ACE2 complex revealed that H11-H4 more strongly binds to RBD without overlapping with ACE2 and triggers dissociation of ACE2 due to electrostatic repulsion. In comparison, Ty1 binding results in dissociation of ACE2 from RBD due to an overlap with the ACE2 binding site, whereas H11-D4 binding does not trigger ACE2 dissociation. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V1 and 501.V2 variants resulted in a negligible effect on RBD-ACE2 binding. However, the 501.V2 variant weakened H11-H4 and H11-D4 binding while strengthening Ty1 binding to RBD. Our simulations indicate that all three nanobodies can neutralize 501Y.V1 while Ty1 is more effective against the 501.V2 variant.","Golcuk, Mert; Hacisuleyman, Aysima; Erman, Burak; Yildiz, Ahmet; Gur, Mert",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.23.441186,614

Here, we established and validated a clinical predictor of infection based on routine admission hematological parameters. The diagnostic model was developed by comparing 85 consecutive patients with symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR with 85 symptomatic, SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. Abnormal hematological parameters significantly (p < 0.05) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were used to derive a “cumulative score” between 0 and 16. The model was validated in an independent cohort of 170 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Several routine hematology parameters were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A “cumulative score” score ≥7 discriminated COVID-19-postive patients from controls with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100% (p < 0.001). The high sensitivity of the predictive model was confirmed in the prospective validation set, and the cumulative score (i) predicted SARS-CoV-2 positivity even when the first oro-nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR result was reported as a false negative in both cohorts and (ii) resulted to be independent from disease severity. The cumulative score based on routine blood parameters can be used to predict an early and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, thereby facilitating triage and optimizing early management and isolation from the COVID-19 free population, particularly useful in overcrowding situations and in resource-poor settings.","Soloperto, Rossana; Guiotto, Giovanna; Tozzi, Giuseppe; Fumi, Maurizio; Tozzi, Angelo",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573908/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11091566,614

Studies investigating the early mental health impact of the pandemic on general population and vulnerable groups, such as healthcare workers, revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, among others, and found several risk and protective factors. Along with these findings, the risk of substance use, suicide, domestic violence, and complicated grief may increase. We further discuss interventions that can be applied at a governmental, institutional, and individual level to minimize the mental health consequences of the pandemic, such as using telehealth to provide remote support or practicing self-care. These interventions should be maintained after the initial outbreak, as current disturbances may impact long-term well-being.

Previously we showed that GL inhibits Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in vitro by interfering with an early step of the EBV replication cycle (possibly attachment/penetration). Here we tested the effects of 15 GL derivatives against EBV infection by scoring the numbers of cell expressing viral antigens and quantifying EBV DNA copy numbers in superinfected Raji cells. The derivatives were made either by transformation of GL on carboxyl and hydroxyl groups or by conjugation of amino acid residues into the carbohydrate part. We identified seven compounds active against EBV and all showed dose-dependent inhibition as determined by both assays. Among these active compounds, the introduction of amino acid residues into the GL carbohydrate part enhanced the antiviral activity in three of the seven active compounds. However, when Glu(OH)-OMe was substituted by Glu(OMe)-OMe, its antiviral activity was completely abolished. Introduction of potassium or ammonium salt to GL reduced the antiviral activity with no significant effect on cytotoxicity. The α-isomer (18α-GL) of 18β-GL was as potent as the β-form, but its sodium salt lost antiviral activity. The metabolic product of GL, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA or GA), was 7.5-fold more active against EBV than its parental compound GL but, concomitantly, exhibited increased cytotoxicity resulting in a decreased therapeutic index.","Lin, Jung-Chung; Cherng, Jaw-Ming; Hung, Man-Shan; Baltina, Lidia A.; Baltina, Lia; Kondratenko, Rimma",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354208002064; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354208002064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18423902/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.01.160,614

In this study, reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) was combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) forming a novel detection tool which could simultaneously detect IBV and NDV visually. Primers targeted the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of IBV genome and the conserved region of NDV large polymerase gene (LP). The specificity and sensitivity of this multiple reverse transcription-LAMP-LFD (mRT-LAMP-LFD) assay were compared with those of conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR), quantification RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and RT-LAMP monitored by electrophoresis. No non-specific amplifications were observed when the assays were tested with unrelated viruses. According to the sensitivity study, when detecting IBV or NDV alone, the lowest detection limits of mRT-LAMP-LFD were 10(0.8) IBV RNA copies/reaction and 10(0.7) NDV RNA copies/reaction. Furthermore, when detecting IBV and NDV simultaneously, the lowest detection limit was the same as that of the single detection assays. In the clinical sample study, mRT-LAMP-LFD performed the best among these assays. When tested with IBV or NDV single infected samples, the mean detection rates were 98.65% and 97.25%, respectively.

Rep. 20 (2020) 101256],2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: The corona virus is transmitted in three ways: by direct contact with an infected person, by droplets, and by air. Transmission control according to official guidelines can be prevented by keeping a distance, wearing a mask and washing hands. Sharing a space with several members of the immediate or extended family increases the risk of transmission in all three ways. In Traditional Bosnian families two or three generations live in one household. The family doctor is informed with living conditions of the residents and has the opportunity to monitor the rate of secondary transmission from the index case, and then recommend additional preventative and treatment measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the first occurrence of the symptoms and to monitor possible intrafamilial transmission of the disease through clinical examinations and microbiological-serological tests. METHODS: The study was conducted in a family medicine clinic in the region of northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina from March to December 2020. Patients with symptoms that could indicate the presence of COVID-19 disease were registered. If COVID-19 was proven, the patient became an index case. The other members of the family would be monitored for the secondary transmission via laboratory (PCA SARS-CoV-2 and IgM and IgG antibodies) and clinical parameters. RESULTS: Characteristics of 25 index cases were analyzed. All 25 of them were middle-aged men that worked outside the home. In 25 households, there was a total of 123 members that shared a home with the index patient. Secondary transmission developed in 76 out of 123 family members (61.8%). Only one patient had a severe form of the disease and was hospitalized. 2 patients died. CONCLUSION: Intrafamiliar transmission of Covid-19 in households of Bosnia and Herzegovina is high. The secondary attack rate of SARS- CoV-2 in households is 61,8%. In the surveyed households, family members use common rooms with an infected patient, and the customs of family gatherings are maintained, without the implementation of protective measures. The family medicine team has the opportunity to apply appropriate preventive action, education and early prehospital treatment as well as adequate selection for the hospital admission.","Salihefendic, Nizama; Zildzic, Muharem; Huseinagic, Haris; Ahmetagic, Sead; Salihefendic, Dzenita; Masic, Izet",Mater Sociomed,https://doi.org/10.5455/msm.2021.33.4-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012342/,614

The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) serves as a useful animal model for studying SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing therapeutic strategies. A holistic approach for distinguishing differences in gene signatures during disease progression is lacking. The present study discovered gene expression profiles of short-term (3 days) and long-term (14 days) ferret models after SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 infection using a bioinformatics approach. Through Gene Ontology (GO) and MetaCore analyses, we found that the development of stemness signaling was related to short-term SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, pathways involving extracellular matrix and immune responses were associated with long-term SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some highly expressed genes in both short- and long-term models played a crucial role in the progression of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 infection, including DPP4, BMP2, NFIA, AXIN2, DAAM1, ZNF608, ME1, MGLL, LGR4, ABHD6, and ACADM. Meanwhile, we revealed that metabolic, glucocorticoid, and reactive oxygen species-associated networks were enriched in both short- and long-term infection models.

Brazilian data from 2016 are used to build a network with more than five thousand cities (nodes) and twenty-seven states with the edges representing the weekly flow of people between cities via terrestrial transports. Nodes are systematically isolated (removed from the network) either at random (failures) or guided by specific strategies (targeted attacks), and the impacts are assessed with three metrics: the number of components, the size of the giant component, and the total remaining flow of people. We propose strategies to identify which regions should be isolated first and their impact on people mobility. The results are compared with the so-called reactive strategy, which consists of isolating regions ordered by the date the first case of COVID-19 appeared. We assume that the nodes’ failures abstract individual municipal and state initiatives that are independent and possess a certain level of unpredictability. Differently, the targeted attacks are related to centralized strategies led by the federal government in agreement with municipalities and states. Removing a node means completely restricting the mobility of people between the referred city/state and the rest of the network. Results reveal that random failures do not cause a high impact on mobility restraint, but the coordinated isolation of specific cities with targeted attacks is crucial to detach entire network areas and thus prevent spreading. Moreover, the targeted attacks perform better than the reactive strategy for the three analyzed robustness metrics.","Freitas, Vander L.S.; Moreira, Gladston J.P.; Santos, Leonardo B.L.",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194438/,614

Significant outbreaks, like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have continued to reveal the capacity gap in autopsy practice, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite the importance of autopsy in investigating previous infectious disease outbreaks, health systems in SSA still assign a lesser priority to autopsy and forensic practice. Some of the critical factors hindering routine clinical autopsy are the lack of experts and facilities, and a health system that focuses less on postmortem examination. Societal traditions and cultural beliefs against the practice of autopsy and manipulation of the dead body are also significant barriers. Nevertheless, strengthening the role of autopsy in clinical practice may help clinicians to more quickly address clinical questions associated with highly infectious outbreaks.","Mawalla, William F.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665910720300852?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2665910720300852,614

Studies of human respiratory infections have been limited by the scarcity of functional models that mimic in vivo physiology and pathophysiology. In the last decades, organoid models have emerged as potential research tools due to the possibility of reproducing in vivo tissue in culture. Despite being studied for over one year, there is still no effective treatment against COVID-19, and investigations using pulmonary tissue and possible therapeutics are still very limited. Thus, human lung organoids can provide robust support to simulate SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication and aid in a better understanding of their effects in human tissue.

Despite this higher risk, PAD and AAA patients are often suboptimality treated. This study assessed the CV profile of PAD and AAA patients, quantifying the survival benefits of target-based risk-factors modification even in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: PAD and AAA patients admitted for any reason to the Vascular Unit from January 2019 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Biochemical and CV profiles as well as ongoing medical therapies were recorded. Benefits of CV risk-factors control were estimated using the SMART-REACH model. A follow-up visit during the year 2020 was scheduled. Results: A total of 669 patients were included. Of these, 190 showed AAA and 479 PAD at any stage. Only 54% of PAD and 41% of AAA patients were on lipid-lowering drugs with non-optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels for most of them. A better control of all modifiable CV risk-factors based on the current guidelines would offer an absolute risk reduction of the mean 10-year CV risk by 9% in PAD and 14% in AAA. Unfortunately, the follow-up visit was lost because of COVID-19 limitations. Conclusions: Lipid profiles of PAD and AAA patients were far from guideline-based targets, and medical management was suboptimal. In our center, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on the strict surveillance required in these very high-risk patients. The achievement of guideline-based therapeutic targets would definitively confer additional significant benefits in reducing the CV risk in these patients.","Natale, Francesco; Capasso, Raffaele; Casalino, Alfonso; Crescenzi, Clotilde; Sangiuolo, Paolo; Golino, Paolo; Loffredo, Francesco S.; Cimmino, Giovanni",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34209552/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57070672,614
625492,The Impact of COVID-19 on Syringe Services Programs in the United States,2020-04-24,"Background: Cybersecurity is increasingly becoming a prominent concern among healthcare providers in adopting digital technologies for improving the quality of care delivered to patients. The recent reports on cyber attacks, such as ransomware and WannaCry, have brought to life the destructive nature of such attacks upon healthcare. In complement to cyberattacks, which have been targeted against the vulnerabilities of information technology (IT) infrastructures, a new form of cyber attack aims to exploit human vulnerabilities; such attacks are categorised as social engineering attacks. Following an increase in the frequency and ingenuity of attacks launched against hospitals and clinical environments with the intention of causing service disruption, there is a strong need to study the level of awareness programmes and training activities offered to the staff by healthcare organisations. Objective: The objective of this systematic review is to identify commonly encountered factors that cybersecurity postures of a healthcare organisation, resulting from the ignorance of cyber threat to healthcare. The systematic review aims to consolidate the current literature being reported upon human behaviour resulting in security gaps that mitigate the cyber defence strategy adopted by healthcare organisations. Additionally, the paper also reviews the organisational risk assessment methodology implemented and the policies being adopted to strengthen cybersecurity. Methods: The topic of cybersecurity within healthcare and the clinical environment has attracted the interest of several researchers, resulting in a broad range of literature. The inclusion criteria for the articles in the review stem from the scope of the five research questions identified. To this end, we conducted seven search queries across three repositories, namely (i) PubMed(®)/MED-LINE; (ii) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and (iii) Web of Science (WoS), using key words related to cybersecurity awareness, training, organisation risk assessment methodologies, policies and recommendations adopted as counter measures within health care. These were restricted to around the last 12 years. Results: A total of 70 articles were selected to be included in the review, which addresses the complexity of cybersecurity measures adopted within the healthcare and clinical environments. The articles included in the review highlight the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats stemming from exploiting IT infrastructures to more advanced attacks launched with the intent of exploiting human vulnerability. A steady increase in the literature on the threat of phishing attacks evidences the growing threat of social engineering attacks. As a countermeasure, through the review, we identified articles that provide methodologies resulting from case studies to promote cybersecurity awareness among stakeholders. The articles included highlight the need to adopt cyber hygiene practices among healthcare professionals while accessing social media platforms, which forms an ideal test bed for the attackers to gain insight into the life of healthcare professionals. Additionally, the review also includes articles that present strategies adopted by healthcare organisations in countering the impact of social engineering attacks. The evaluation of the cybersecurity risk assessment of an organisation is another key area of study reported in the literature that recommends the organisation of European and international standards in countering social engineering attacks. Lastly, the review includes articles reporting on national case studies with an overview of the economic and societal impact of service disruptions encountered due to cyberattacks. Discussion: One of the limitations of the review is the subjective ranking of the authors associated to the relevance of literature to each of the research questions identified. We also acknowledge the limited amount of literature that focuses on human factors of cybersecurity in health care in general; therefore, the search queries were formulated using well-established cybersecurity related topics categorised according to the threats, risk assessment and organisational strategies reported in the literature.","Nifakos, Sokratis; Chandramouli, Krishna; Nikolaou, Charoula Konstantina; Papachristou, Panagiotis; Koch, Sabine; Panaousis, Emmanouil; Bonacina, Stefano",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372354/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21155119,614
625683,COVID-19 pandemic in Japan,2020-11-17,"ABSTRACT: The current outbreak of the highly transmittable and life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved rapidly and posed a global health emergency. Many clinical trials are now being conducted to test possible therapies. To assist this, virtual screening via molecular docking was performed on several FDA-approved drugs, previously used in epidemics, and the top ten compounds were selected. These ten well-characterized drugs, previously used to treat malaria and Ebola infections, were screened based on their interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor and 3C-like protease. Compared to the other nine medicines, brincidofovir, an ether lipid ester analog of cidofovir with potent antiviral activity, showed the highest docking scores and binding interactions. Therefore, brincidofovir is worth further investigations and clinical trials as a possible therapeutic agent for the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2.

626204,"Symptoms of ADHD Predict Lower Adaptation to the COVID-19 Outbreak: Financial Decline, Low Adherence to Preventive Measures, Psychological Distress, and Illness-Related Negative Perceptions",2021,"The sudden emergence of severe respiratory disease, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has recently become a public health emergency. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed its close resemblance to the earlier reported SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, initial testing of the drugs used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been ineffective in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present review looks to highlight the differences in genomic, proteomic, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies of SARS-CoV-2. We have carried out sequence analysis of potential drug target proteins in SARS-CoV-2 and, compared them with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS viruses. Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 has also been done. A detailed structural analysis of drug target proteins was performed to gain insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and the development of structure-guided therapeutic approaches. The cytokine profiling and inflammatory signalling are different in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also highlighted possible therapies and their mechanism of action followed by clinical manifestation. Our analysis suggests a minimal variation in the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for a drastic change in the structures of target proteins, makes available drugs ineffective.","Naqvi, Ahmad Abu Turab; Fatima, Kisa; Mohammad, Taj; Fatima, Urooj; Singh, Indrakant K.; Singh, Archana; Atif, Shaikh Muhammad; Hariprasad, Gururao; Hasan, Gulam Mustafa; Hassan, Md.

In the current emergency phase, the problem of infections in residential structures for the elderly is taking on considerable importance in relation to the significant prevalence rates of COVID-19. SAFETY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES: Prevention and control measures for SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes should be planned before a possible outbreak of COVID-19 occurs and should be intensified during any exacerbation of the same. Each facility should identify a properly trained contact person—also external—for the prevention and control of infections, who can refer to a multidisciplinary support committee and who is in close contact with the local health authorities. The contact person should collaborate with professionals in order to prepare a prevention and intervention plan that considers national provisions and scientific evidence, the requirements for reporting patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, the indications for the management of suspected, probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Adequate risk management in residential structures implies the establishment of a coordination committee with dedicated staff, the implementation of a surveillance program for the rapid recognition of the outbreaks, the identification of suitable premises and equipment, the application of universal precautions, the adaptation of care plans to reduce the possibility of contagion among residents, the protection of operators and staff training initiatives.","Scopetti, Matteo; Santurro, Alessandro; Tartaglia, Riccardo; Frati, Paola; Fineschi, Vittorio",Int J Qual Health Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32720688/; https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa085,614
626846,Adherence of home‐based Wu Qin Xi programs during the COVID‐19 epidemic in Shanghai,2020-08-21,"SARS-CoV-2 has made >190-million infections worldwide, thus it is pivotal to understand the viral impacts on host cells. Many viruses can significantly alter host chromatin(1), but such roles of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. Here, we characterized the three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture and epigenome landscapes in human cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealing remarkable restructuring of host chromatin architecture. High-resolution Hi-C 3.0 uncovered widespread A compartmental weakening and A-B mixing, together with a global reduction of intra-TAD chromatin contacts. The cohesin complex, a central organizer of the 3D genome, was significantly depleted from intra-TAD regions, supporting that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts cohesin loop extrusion. Calibrated ChIP-Seq verified chromatin restructuring by SARS-CoV-2 that is particularly manifested by a pervasive reduction of euchromatin modifications. Built on the rewired 3D genome/epigenome maps, a modified activity-by-contact model(2) highlights the transcriptional weakening of antiviral interferon response genes or virus sensors (e.g., DDX58) incurred by SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, pro-inflammatory genes (e.g. IL-6) high in severe infections were uniquely regulated by augmented H3K4me3 at their promoters. These findings illustrate how SARS-CoV-2 rewires host chromatin architecture to confer immunological gene deregulation, laying a foundation to characterize the long-term epigenomic impacts of this virus.","Wang, Ruoyu; Lee, Joo-Hyung; Xiong, Feng; Kim, Jieun; Al Hasani, Lana; Yuan, Xiaoyi; Shivshankar, Pooja; Krakowiak, Joanna; Qi, Chuangye; Wang, Yanyu; Eltzschig, Holger K.; Li, Wenbo",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312624/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.453146,614

We report the details of a second family cluster of MERS-CoV infections from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We present the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological details of 3 patients from a family cluster of MERS-CoV infections. RESULTS: The first patient developed respiratory symptoms and fever 14 days after admission to hospital for an unrelated reason. He died 11 days later with multi-organ failure. Two of his brothers presented later to another hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever. MERS-CoV infection in the latter 2 patients was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. All 3 patients had fever, cough, shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. No hospital or other social contacts are known to have acquired the infection. It appears that the index patient in this cluster acquired MERS-CoV infection whilst in hospital from an unrecognized mild or asymptomatic case. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV acquisition from unrecognized mild or asymptomatic cases may be a more important contributor to ongoing transmission than previously appreciated.","Omrani, Ali S.; Matin, Mohammad Abdul; Haddad, Qais; Al-Nakhli, Daifullah; Memish, Ziad A.; Albarrak, Ali M.",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971213002257; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971213002257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23916548/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2013.07.001,614

627123,Suicidal behaviors and ideation during emerging viral disease outbreaks before the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic rapid review,2020-10-02,"INTRODUCTION: Molecular diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infection characteristically involves the sampling of the throat or nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). However, these procedures are invasive, require necessary skills for sample collection, cause patient discomfort, and are non-conducive for extensive scale testing. Saliva is increasingly being suggested as an alternate diagnostic sample in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. OBJECTIVES: This scoping review was done with the objective of exploring the evidence on the role of saliva as an alternate diagnostic sample in SARS‐CoV‐2 condition. METHODS: Thorough search of the literature in major databases was undertaken in June 2020 using free text and MESH terms, followed by PRISMA to identify 17 studies for data extraction. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was summarised for study characteristics, salivary sampling characteristics, viral load, and longevity of virus in saliva. The literature supports that saliva offers a simple sample collection method compared to technique-sensitive NPS and has the advantage of point-of-care testing for initial screening in community or hospital-based set-up. The additional highlights of this review are heterogeneity in the current literature and the gaps in methodology. Therefore, a robust study design to generate higher levels of evidence has been proposed.","Kapoor, Priyanka; Chowdhry, Aman; Kharbanda, Om Prakash; Bablani Popli, Deepika; Gautam, Kamini; Saini, Vikram",BDJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41405-021-00064-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500385/,614
627222,The “Great Lockdown”: Inactive workers and mortality by Covid‐19,2021-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases are of great economic importance in commercial pig production, causing both clinical and subclinical disease, with influence on welfare, productivity, and antibiotic use. The causes of these diseases are often multifactorial and laboratory diagnostics are seldom routinely performed. The aim of the present study was to explore the benefits of monthly pathogen monitoring in nursery and finisher herds and to examine association between laboratory results and observed clinical signs, including coughing and diarrhoea. Three monthly samplings were conducted in three different age groups in six nursery and four finisher production units. For each unit, two pens were randomly selected in each age group and evaluated for coughing and diarrhoea events. Furthermore, faecal sock and oral fluid samples were collected in the selected pens and analysed for 18 respiratory and enteric viral and bacterial pathogens using the high-throughput real-time PCR BioMark HD platform (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, USA). RESULTS: In total, 174 pens were sampled in which eight coughing events and 77 diarrhoeic events were observed. The overall findings showed that swine influenza A virus, porcine circovirus 2, porcine cytomegalovirus, Brachyspira pilosicoli, Lawsonia intracellularis, Escherichia coli fimbria types F4 and F18 were found to be prevalent in several of the herds. Association between coughing events and the presence of swine influenza A virus, porcine cytomegalovirus (Cq ≤ 20) or a combination of these were found. Furthermore, an association between diarrhoeic events and the presence of L. intracellularis (Cq ≤ 24) or B. pilosicoli (Cq ≤ 26) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The use of high-throughput real-time PCR analysis for continuous monitoring of pathogens and thereby dynamics of infections in a pig herd, provided the veterinarian and farmer with an objective knowledge on the distribution of pathogens in the herd. In addition, the use of a high-throughput method in combination with information about clinical signs, productivity, health status and antibiotic consumption, presents a new and innovative way of diagnosing and monitoring pig herds and even to a lower cost than the traditional method.","Goecke, Nicole B.; Kobberø, Maja; Kusk, Thomas K.; Hjulsager, Charlotte K.; Pedersen, Ken Steen; Kristensen, Charlotte S.; Larsen, Lars E.",Porcine Health Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32922832/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-020-00161-3,614
628406,Suicide and the agent–host–environment triad: leveraging surveillance sources to inform prevention,2021-03-05,"Direct‐acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represent a class of drugs targeting viral proteins and have been demonstrated to be very successful in combating viral infections in clinic. However, DAAs suffer from several inherent limitations, including narrow‐spectrum antiviral profiles and liability to drug resistance, and hence there are still unmet needs in the treatment of viral infections. In comparison, host targeting antivirals (HTAs) target host factors for antiviral treatment. Since host proteins are probably broadly required for various viral infections, HTAs are not only perceived, but also demonstrated to exhibit broad‐spectrum antiviral activities. In addition, host proteins are not under the genetic control of viral genome, and hence HTAs possess much higher genetic barrier to drug resistance as compared with DAAs. In recent years, much progress has been made to the development of HTAs with the approval of chemokine receptor type 5 antagonist maraviroc for human immunodeficiency virus treatment and more in the pipeline for other viral infections. In this review, we summarize various host proteins as antiviral targets from a medicinal chemistry prospective. Challenges and issues associated with HTAs are also discussed.","Ji, Xingyue; Li, Zhuorong",Med Res Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32060956/; https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21664,614

629489,Psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on LGBT people in Chile,2021-01-02,"Background: Contact tracing and lockdown are health policies being used worldwide to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19). While easing lockdown, the UK National Health Service (NHS) launched its Track and Trace Service at the end of May 2020, and aims by end of June 2020 also to include app-based notification and advice to self-isolate for those who have been in contact with a person known to have COVID-19. To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. Objectives: To measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE) - the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Methods: Observational study of 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% of whom completed a novel questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation -- related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. Results: 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded ""no"", 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6/10 (OR for 1-2/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48 - 0.67]; OR for 3-4/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64 - 0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app; belief of previous recovery from COVID-19 infection OR 0.727 [0.585 - 0.908]). Conclusions: In this large UK-wide questionnaire of wellbeing in lockdown, a willingness for app-based contact tracing is 60% - close to the estimated 56% population uptake, and substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for an app-based contact-tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic. Given this marginal level of support over an appropriate age range, the impacts of difficulty comprehending government advice and a policy of not testing to confirm self-reported COVID-19 infection during lockdown indicate that uncertainty in communication and diagnosis in adopted public health policies will negatively impact the effectiveness of a government contact tracing app.","Bachtiger, P.; Adamson, A.; Quint, J.

Spain has suffered one of the largest nationwide bursts, particularly in the highly populated areas of Madrid and Barcelona (two of the five largest conurbations in Europe). We used segmented regression analyses to identify shifts in the evolution of the effective reproduction number (Rt) reported for 16 Spanish administrative regions. We associate these breaking points with a timeline of key containment measures taken by national and regional governments, applying time lags for the time from contagion to case detection, with their associated errors. Results show an early decrease of Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown; a generalized, sharp decrease in Rt associated with such lockdown; a low impact of the strengthened lockdown, with a flattening of Rt evolution in high-incidence regions, and even increases in Rt at low-incidence regions; and an increase in Rt associated to the relaxation of the lockdown measures in ten regions. These results evidence the importance of generalized lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread, and the limited effect of the subsequent application of a stricter lockdown (restrictions to all non-essential economic activities). Most importantly, they highlight the importance of maintaining strong social distancing measures and strengthening public health control during lockdown de-escalation.","Santamaría, Luis; Hortal, Joaquín",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720357867?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181975/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720357867; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142257,614

To date, there is no specific treatment proven effective against this viral disease. In addition, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent MERS-CoV infection thus far. Therefore, our current review focuses on the most recent studies in search of an effective MERS vaccine. Overall, vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV are mainly based upon the viral spike (S) protein, due to its vital role in the viral infectivity, although several studies focused on other viral proteins such as the nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, and non-structural protein 16 (NSP16) have also been reported. In general, the potential vaccine candidates can be classified into six types: viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, nanoparticle-based vaccine, inactivated-whole virus vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine, which are discussed in detail. Besides, the immune responses and potential antibody dependent enhancement of MERS-CoV infection are extensively reviewed.

Methods Following Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective qualitative analysis of transcribed interviews obtained by six undergraduate students participating in the Oakland University Ideas to Business Program (I2B) was conducted. Students interviewed nine local physical therapy clinical managers throughout Michigan using 12 questions developed by content experts. Questions aimed to ascertain the perceived opportunities and barriers to implementing HOP-UP-PT into each respondent's practice setting, clinic demographics, and suggested price point of a prevention-focused continuing education. Interview data was analyzed using the constant comparative method to identify themes and concepts. Results Sixty-seven percent of respondents (n=6) reported practicing in an outpatient setting; 56% of respondents (n=5) indicated 50% or more of their clients were 65 years and older; and 67% of respondents (n=6) suggested a price point of $200-$500 for an eight-hour HOP-UP-PT training course. Three concepts (community involvement and partnership, administrative barriers to an innovative delivery model, and foundational physical therapy [PT] skills utilized in a novel approach) and eight themes (community altruism, referral source expansion, integrated community relationships, current payment methodology challenges, favorability of clinic setting and type, minimal additional training required, willingness to pay for certification training, and prevention-focused or upstream mindset) were identified. Conclusion Physical therapy clinical managers identified a willingness to expand current rehabilitation models and incorporate prevention-focused care delivery into the existing care delivery approach. However, barriers and opportunities must be addressed in advance of a program roll-out to achieve optimal outcomes and cost savings within the healthcare system.","Naccarato, Alicia; Wilson, Christopher M; Arena, Sara K",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084684/,614

We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 44 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from children attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment using the WHO algorithm, swine flu hospital pathway for children (SFHPC), Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) and Childrens Observation and Severity Tool (COAST). We recorded 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We collected data from 1530 children, including 26 (1.7%) with an adverse outcome. C-statistics were 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.87) for the WHO algorithm, 0.80 (0.71-0.90) for POPS, 0.76 (0.67-0.85) for COAST, and 0.71 (0.59-0.82) for SFHPC. Using pre-specified thresholds, the WHO algorithm had the highest sensitivity (0.85) and lowest specificity (0.75), but POPS and COAST could optimise sensitivity (0.96 and 0.92 respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.25 and 0.38 respectively) by using a threshold of any score above zero instead of the pre-specified threshold. Conclusion: Existing triage tools have good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in children with suspected COVID-19. POPS and COAST could achieve an appropriate balance of sensitivity and specificity for supporting decisions to discharge home by considering any score above zero to be positive.","Biggs, Katie; Thomas, Ben; Goodacre, Steve; Lee, Ellen; Sutton, Laura; Bursnall, Matthew; Loban, Amanda; Waterhouse, Simon; Simmonds, Richard; Marincowitz, Carl; Schutter, Jose; Connelly, Sarah; Sheldon, Elena; Hall, Jamie; Young, Emma; Bentley, Andrew; Challen, Kirsty; Fitzsimmons, Chris; Harris, Tim; Lecky, Fiona; Lee, Andrew; Maconochie, Ian; Walter, Darren",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.01.20185793v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20185793,614

Recent studies have reported astroviruses in bats in Europe and in several locations in China. We sampled 1876 bats from 17 genera at 45 sites from 14 and 13 provinces in Cambodia and Lao PDR respectively, and tested them for astroviruses. Our study revealed a high diversity of astroviruses among various Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera bats. Evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for astroviruses in bats was found. Furthermore, additional Pteropodid hosts were detected. The astroviruses formed distinct phylogenetic clusters within the genus Mamastrovirus, most closely related to other known bat astroviruses. The astrovirus sequences were found to be highly saturated indicating that phylogenetic relationships should be interpreted carefully. An astrovirus clustering in a group with other viruses from diverse hosts, including from ungulates and porcupines, was found in a Rousettus bat. These findings suggest that diverse astroviruses can be found in many species of mammals, including bats.","Lacroix, Audrey; Duong, Veasna; Hul, Vibol; San, Sorn; Davun, Holl; Omaliss, Keo; Chea, Sokha; Hassanin, Alexandre; Theppangna, Watthana; Silithammavong, Soubanh; Khammavong, Kongsy; Singhalath, Sinpakone; Afelt, Aneta; Greatorex, Zoe; Fine, Amanda E.; Goldstein, Tracey; Olson, Sarah; Joly, Damien O.; Keatts, Lucy; Dussart, Philippe; Frutos, Roger; Buchy, Philippe",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816304877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871796/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816304877; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.11.013,614

Thus, the aims of this study were twofold: (1) to compare inspiratory and expiratory airway lumen area (IAA and EAA, respectively) on computed tomography (CT) among supine and standing positions; and (2) to investigate if IAA and EAA are associated with lung function abnormality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Forty-eight patients with COPD underwent both low-dose conventional (supine position) and upright CT (standing position) during inspiration and expiration breath-holds and a pulmonary function test (PFT) on the same day. We measured the IAA and EAA in each position. RESULTS: For the trachea to the third-generation bronchi, the IAA was significantly larger in the standing position than in the supine position (4.1–4.9% increase, all p < 0.05). The EAA of all bronchi was significantly larger in the standing position than in the supine position (9.7–62.5% increases, all p < 0.001). The correlation coefficients of IAA in the standing position and forced expiratory volume in 1 s were slightly higher than those in the supine position. The correlation coefficients of EAA or EAA/IAA in the standing position and residual volume, and the inspiratory capacity/total lung capacity ratio were higher than those in the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: Airway lumen areas were larger in the standing position than in the supine position. IAAs reflect airway obstruction, and EAAs reflect lung hyperinflation.

631540,The role of pandemic‐related pregnancy stress in preference for community birth during the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the United States,2021-03-06,"Although most influenza infections are self-limited, few other diseases exert such a huge toll of suffering and economic loss. Despite the importance of influenza, there had been, until recently, little advance in its control since amantadine was licensed almost 40 years ago. During the past decade, evidence has accrued on the protection afforded by inactivated vaccines and the safety and efficacy in children of live influenza-virus vaccines. There have been many new developments in vaccine technology. Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management. Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic. The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza. Improvements in animal and human surveillance, new approaches to vaccination, and increasing use of vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat annual influenza outbreaks are essential to reduce the global toll of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.","Nicholson, Karl G; Wood, John M; Zambon, Maria",Lancet,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673603148544; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673603148544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14643124/,614

Coronaviruses induce an MS-like disease in rodents, are neuroinvasive in humans and can infect primary cultures of human astrocytes and microglia. Infection of the human astrocytic cell line U-373MG by the OC43 strain of human coronavirus caused an upregulation of IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 mRNA expression. This virus also modulated the activity of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 and augmented nitric oxide production in both U-373MG cells and the human microglial cell line CHME-5.

632751,Frequency and Pattern of Outpatient Dental Visits during the COVID-19 Pandemic at Hospital and Community Clinics,2021-09-30,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, is a respiratory virus primarily transmitted person to person through inhalation of droplets or aerosols, laden with viral particles. However, as recent studies have shown, virions can remain infectious for up to 72 h on surfaces, which can lead to transmission through contact. Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end (E2E) study showed that the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces includes using an Isohelix swab collection tool, DNA/RNA Shield as a preservative, an automated system for RNA extraction, and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as the detection assay. Using this E2E approach, this study showed that, in some cases, noninfectious viral fragments of SARS-CoV-2 persisted on surfaces for as long as 8 days even after bleach treatment. Additionally, debris associated with specific built environment surfaces appeared to inhibit and negatively impact the recovery of RNA; Amerstat demonstrated the highest inhibition (>90%) when challenged with an inactivated viral control. Overall, it was determined that this E2E protocol required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm(2) to successfully detect virus from test surfaces. Despite our findings of viral fragment longevity on surfaces, when this method was employed to evaluate 368 samples collected from various built environmental surfaces, all samples tested negative, indicating that the surfaces were either void of virus or below the detection limit of the assay. IMPORTANCE The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) pandemic has led to a global slowdown with far-reaching financial and social impacts. The SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus is primarily transmitted from person to person through inhalation of infected droplets or aerosols. However, some studies have shown that virions can remain infectious on surfaces for days and can lead to human infection from contact with infected surfaces. Thus, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the efficiency of protocols to recover SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces in built environments. This end-to-end study showed that the effective combination for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces required a minimum of 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm(2) to successfully detect virus from surfaces. This comprehensive study can provide valuable information regarding surface monitoring of various materials as well as the capacity to retain viral RNA and allow for effective disinfection.","Parker, Ceth W.; Singh, Nitin; Tighe, Scott; Blachowicz, Adriana; Wood, Jason M.; Seuylemezian, Arman; Vaishampayan, Parag; Urbaniak, Camilla; Hendrickson, Ryan; Laaguiby, Pheobe; Clark, Kevin; Clement, Brian G.; O’Hara, Niamh B.; Couto-Rodriguez, Mara; Bezdan, Daniela; Mason, Christopher E.; Venkateswaran, Kasthuri",mSystems,https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00771-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024053/,614

A mixed-methods study,2021-06-23,"OBJECTIVES: The long-term dynamics of antibody responses in patients with influenza A(H7N9) virus infection are not well understood. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal serological follow-up study in patients who were hospitalized with A(H7N9) virus infection, during 2013–2018. A(H7N9) virus-specific antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization (NT) assays. A random intercept model was used to fit a curve to HAI antibody responses over time. HAI antibody responses were compared by clinical severity. RESULTS: Of 67 patients with A(H7N9) virus infection, HAI antibody titers reached 40 on average 11 days after illness onset and peaked at a titer of 290 after three months, and average titers of ≥80 and ≥40 were present until 11 months and 22 months respectively. HAI antibody responses were significantly higher in patients who experienced severe disease, including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, compared with patients who experienced less severe illness. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survived severe disease mounted higher antibody responses that persisted for longer periods compared with those that experienced moderate disease. Studies of convalescent plasma treatment for A(H7N9) patients should consider collection of donor plasma from survivors of severe disease between 1 and 11 months after illness onset.","Chen, Junbo; Zhu, Huachen; Horby, Peter W.; Wang, Qianli; Zhou, Jiaxin; Jiang, Hui; Liu, Liwei; Zhang, Tianchen; Zhang, Yongli; Chen, Xinhua; Deng, Xiaowei; Nikolay, Birgit; Wang, Wei; Cauchemez, Simon; Guan, Yi; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Yu, Hongjie",J Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320300256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31954742/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320300256; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2019.11.024,614

We have studied whether such an altered Golgi complex can carry out the glycosylation and transport to the plasma membrane (PM) of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) glycoproteins in double-infected cells. Double-immunofluorescence staining showed that approximately 90% of the cells became infected with both viruses. Almost the same final yield of infectious SFV was obtained from double-infected cells as from cells infected with SFV alone. The rate of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the GC to the plasma membrane of the SFV glycoproteins was analysed by immunofluorescence, surface radioimmunoassay and pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, endoglycosidase H digestion and SDS-PAGE. The results showed that: the SFV glycoproteins were readily transported to the cell surface in double-infected cells, whereas the UUK glycoproteins were retained in the GC; the transport to the PM was retarded by approximately 20 min, due to a delay between the ER and the central Golgi; E1 of SFV appeared at the PM in a sialylated form. These results indicate that the morphologically altered GC had retained its functional integrity to glycosylate and transport plasma membrane glycoproteins.","Gahmberg, N; Pettersson, R F; Kääriäinen, L",EMBO J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3545812/,614

To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced 10 complete genomes of MERS-CoVs isolated from 2 live and 8 dead dromedaries from different regions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Phylogenetic analysis revealed one novel clade A strain, the first detected in the UAE, and nine clade B strains. Strain D998/15 had a distinct phylogenetic position within clade A, being more closely related to the dromedary isolate NRCE-HKU205 from Egypt than to the human isolates EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012. A comparison of predicted protein sequences also demonstrated the existence of two clade A lineages with unique amino acid substitutions, A1 (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012) and A2 (D998/15 and NRCE-HKU205), circulating in humans and camels, respectively.

MethodsWe undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set. ResultsWe analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, consciousness, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.34 (0.34-0.35) for scores above four points.

634708,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Self-Reported Management of Chronic Conditions,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe infections, including bacteremia and sepsis. The spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) highlights the need for novel treatment options. Sodium new houttuyfonate (SNH) is an analogue of houttuynin, the main antibacterial ingredient of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro activity of SNH and its potential for synergy with antibiotics against hospital-associated MRSA. METHODOLOGY: A total of 103 MRSA clinical isolates recovered in two hospitals in Beijing were evaluated for susceptibility to SNH, oxacillin, cephalothin, meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin, minocycline, netilmicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by broth microdilution. Ten isolates were evaluated for potential for synergy between SNH and the antibiotics above by checkerboard assay. Time-kill analysis was performed in three isolates to characterize the kill kinetics of SNH alone and in combination with the antibiotics that engendered synergy in checkerboard assays. Besides, two reference strains were included in all assays. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SNH inhibited all test strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 16 to 64 µg/mL in susceptibility tests, and displayed inhibition to bacterial growth in concentration-dependent manner in time-kill analysis. In synergy studies, the combinations of SNH-oxacillin, SNH-cephalothin, SNH-meropenem and SNH-netilmicin showed synergistic effects against 12 MRSA strains with median fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of 0.38, 0.38, 0.25 and 0.38 in checkerboard assays. In time-kill analysis, SNH at 1/2 MIC in combination with oxacillin at 1/128 to 1/64 MIC or netilmicin at 1/8 to 1/2 MIC decreased the viable colonies by ≥2log(10) CFU/mL. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SNH demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against 103 hospital-associated MRSA isolates. Combinations of sub-MIC levels of SNH and oxacillin or netilmicin significantly improved the in vitro antibacterial activity against MRSA compared with either drug alone. The SNH-based combinations showed promise in combating MRSA.","Lu, Xi; Yang, Xinyi; Li, Xue; Lu, Yun; Ren, Zhitao; Zhao, Longyin; Hu, Xinxin; Jiang, Jiandong; You, Xuefu",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23844154/,614

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with microembolism or microvascular endothelial injuries. Here, we report that syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a component of the endothelial glycocalyx, may be a biomarker of severity classification for COVID-19 related to endothelial injury. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We analyzed the data of COVID-19 patients for 1 year from February 2020 at Yokohama City University Hospital and Yokohama City University Medical Center Hospital. We selected COVID-19 patients who required admission care, including intensive care, and analyzed the classification of severe and critical COVID-19 retrospectively, using various clinical data and laboratory data with SDC-1 by ELISA. RESULTS: We analyzed clinical and laboratory data with SDC-1 in five severe COVID-19 and ten critical COVID-19 patients. In the two groups, their backgrounds were almost the same. In laboratory data, the LDH, CHE, and CRP levels showed significant differences in each group (P = 0.032, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.007, respectively) with no significant differences in coagulation-related factors (platelet, PT-INR, d-dimer, ISTH score; P = 0.200, 0.277, 0.655, and 0.36, respectively). For the clinical data, the SOFA score was significantly different from admission day to day 14 of admission (p < 0.0001). The SDC-1 levels of critical COVID-19 patients were significantly higher on admission day and all-time course compared with the levels of severe COVID-19 patients (P = 0.009 and P < 0.0001, respectively).

At the same time, for some of these young people, particularly those with supportive living situations, sheltering in place and online schooling has afforded them the opportunity to freely explore and consolidate their gender, protected from the strains of socially induced anxieties, and anticipated or experienced negative, hostile messages from their surrounding environment (ie, school or public meeting places). Culling from emerging data on the psychosocial effects of the pandemic on TGE children and youth, an argument is made for an understanding of these young people's experiences as both stress-inducing and resilience-building, each existing in dialectic tension with the other. Providers are called on to hold both in mind to fortify the biopsychosocial well-being of transgender and gender expansive children and youth.

635997,Management of primary cutaneous lymphomas during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-01-09,"Since the first case of COVID-19 in the U.S. on January 20, 2020, the disease caused by the new strain of coronavirus has spread exponentially across the country. While the spread of this disease can be significantly slowed if people practice ""social distancing,"" it is difficult to break old habits and acquire new behaviors at the needed speed. The purpose of this study is to challenge how health risk messages are currently communicated (specifically by considering how the Center of Disease Control (CDC) communicates its recommendations for social distancing) and suggest an alternative way. We tested and applied the use of a robust behavioral intervention known as ""if-then"" plans (plans that spell out in advance how one wants to achieve a goal they have previously set) to encourage the acquisition of a new behavior (e.g., social distancing) during this time of crisis. Using a longitudinal mixed design (within-/between-subjects study) daily diary study, we hypothesized and observed (via multilevel modeling) that those randomized into the experimental group (those who created and practiced if-then plans) demonstrated increased social distancing over time, whereas engagement in social distancing did not change in the control condition (those who observed the CDC guidelines). These results were sustained in a 3-week follow-up examination for those who were strongly committed to the goal to social distance. Such evidence suggests that risk communication messaging that includes if-then plans is an effective way of acquiring new behaviors.

Age is a strong predictor of Covid-19 mortality. Crude death rates have been used to compare the response of countries, however, this measure does not account for age structure. We report age-adjusted mortality and rates at similar timeframes, ~100 days from the 50th confirmed case, for 51 countries, as well as 50 states in the US and the District of Columbia. We found age-adjusted mortality rate at ~ 100 days is 18 times greater in New Jersey (largest mortality in the U.S.), compared to Maine (lowest mortality in the U.S). Similar patterns were present in world countries. In Japan, the age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.1; while in Peru was 47.6 at ~ 100 days of Covid-19 transmission (476 times higher). Europe, Latin America, and the US, resulted in highest age-adjusted mortality rates worldwide during the first 100 days of transmission. The data suggest that measures taken by different territories might be a factor for the different mortality rates across regions and countries worldwide. Age-adjustments are needed to compare mortality between populations with different age-structures. This article is protected by copyright.

637581,Barrier resuscitation by lay rescuers during COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-29,"In the opinion of the medical societies of hygiene and pediatrics undersigning the present statement, the analyses published to date regarding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the course of CoVid-19 show that children play a much less significant role in the spread of the virus than do adults. According to the findings available to date, not only do children and adolescents less frequently fall ill with CoVid-19, they also generally become less severely ill than do adults. The vast majority of infections in children and adolescents are asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic. Even the first analyses from China demonstrated that children and adolescents play a subordinate role in the transmission of the virus – not only to other children and adolescents, but also to adults. Taking into account regional infection rates and available resources, daycare centers, kindergartens and elementary schools promptly should be reopened. For children, this should be possible without excessive restrictions, such as clustering into very small groups, implementation of barrier precautions, maintaining appropriate distance from others or wearing masks. A factor more decisive than individual group size is the issue of sustaining the constancy of respective group members and the avoidance of intermixing. Children can be taught basic rules of hygiene such as handwashing and careful hygiene behavior when coming into contact with others during mealtimes and/or when using sanitary facilities. Independent of the prevention measures implemented for children and adolescents, the protection of teachers, educators and caregivers is crucial, (e.g., the maintenance of appropriate distance from others, use of medical masks, situation-dependent hand disinfection, when necessary, supported by regular pool testing). Children over the age of 10 and adolescents up to school graduation age are more capable of actively understanding and conforming to specific hygiene rules. For this group, maintaining appropriate distance from others (1.5 meters), wearing a mouth-and-nose protection (whenever they are not sitting in their assigned classroom seats) and consistent education regarding the basic rules of infection prevention may provide increased options for normalizing teaching activities. Children and adolescents suspected of infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be tested immediately in order to either confirm or rule out such an infection. Evidence of individual infections in children or students must not automatically lead to the closure of the entire daycare center or school. A detailed analysis of the chain of infection is a prerequisite for a balanced approach to infection control. The opening of schools and children’s facilities should be accompanied by specifically structured, model surveillance studies that further clarify outstanding questions about infectious disease events and hygiene control. These prospective, concomitant examinations will be essential for the purpose of evaluating and verifying the effectiveness of the required hygiene measures.","Walger, Peter; Heininger, Ulrich; Knuf, Markus; Exner, Martin; Popp, Walter; Fischbach, Thomas; Trapp, Stefan; Hübner, Johannes; Herr, Caroline; Simon, Arne",GMS Hyg Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32547911/; https://doi.org/10.3205/dgkh000346,614
638220,Impact of COVID-19 on medical students’ mental wellbeing in Jordan,2021-06-17,"Background: Cancer patients (pts) have higher risk of serious COVID-19 symptoms, morbidity and mortality than general population. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials excluded patients with metastatic cancer or undergoing immunosuppressive therapies;therefore, the effectiveness of vaccines are unknown in this population. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the correlation between cancer type, its treatment and vaccine efficacy. Trial design: Methods: This is a prospective study conducted by the Oncology Unit of Cremona (Cr) Hospital, enrolling pts from Oncology, Hematology, Radiotherapy (RT) and Palliative Care divisions. The trial aims to evaluate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines [BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)], incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, antibodies (Abs) response and onset of adverse events (AEs) in a consecutive population of 300 cancer pts, undergoing antiblastic therapies, starting from March 2021. A vaccination point was set up by Cr Hospital, dedicated to cancer pts treated with chemotherapy (CT), TKIs, RT, hormones. Only pts in follow-up or treated with adjuvant hormone are excluded. CT was suspended at least 5 days before and 3 days after vaccination;targeted therapy, immunotherapy and RT are not interrupted. Primary endpoint: Number of symptomatic pts affected by COVID-19, diagnosed 7-60 days after the 2nddose of vaccines. The infection is defined according to the FDA criteria combined with a positive nasopharyngeal swab. Secondary endpoints: Abs variation at different timepoints compared to baseline;vaccine-related adverse events;duration of abs, up to 12 months after 2nd dose;correlation between effectiveness of vaccines and antiblastic treatments, tumor burden, PS ECOG. Statistical analysis: The primary objective will be tested by non-inferiority one-single proportion test, compared with the value of 95% observed in the vaccine registration trials. The hypothesis of vaccine inferiority in the trial population is rejected if a rate of protection conferred by the vaccine is observed in 89% of the sample size.

With the rapid increase in the number of infections, an increase is observed in the number of children with COVID‐19. Most research findings are regarding adult cases, which are not always transferrable to children. Evidence‐based studies are still expected to formulate clinical decisions for pediatric patients. In this review, we included 2597 pediatric patients that reported recently and evaluated the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of children with COVID‐19. We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults; it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%). Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to occur in pediatric patients. Our analysis may contribute to determine the spectrum of disease in children and to develop strategies to control the disease transmission.","Cui, Xiaojian; Zhang, Tongqiang; Zheng, Jiafeng; Zhang, Jiayi; Si, Ping; Xu, Yongsheng; Guo, Wei; Liu, Zihui; Li, Wenliang; Ma, Jia; Dong, Cuicui; Shen, Yongming; Cai, Chunquan; He, Sijia",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418216/,614
638271,Effects of COVID-19 pandemic in the field of orthopaedics,2020-04-09,"The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in use or in advanced clinical development are based on the viral spike protein (S) as their immunogen. S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described that act against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies will depend upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving, circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, while avoiding the risk of antibody dependent enhancement as observed with other Coronavirus vaccines. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer that is arrested in the closed state to prevent exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with the receptor. We compared this with a range of other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induce a long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody response as well as T-cell responses. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralising responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, virus-inhibiting immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.","Carnell, George W.; Ciazynska, Katarzyna A.; Wells, David A.; Xiong, Xiaoli; Aguinam, Ernest T.; McLaughlin, Stephen H.; Mallery, Donna; Ebrahimi, Soraya; Ceron-Gutierrez, Lourdes; James, Leo C.; Doffinger, Rainer; Heeney, Jonathan L.; Briggs, John A.

Rigorous control measures were introduced and could only be relaxed once the outbreak was declared over. Each day after the apparent outbreak end, we estimated the risk of future cases occurring, to inform decision-making. METHODS: Probabilistic transmission networks were reconstructed and transmission parameters (the reproduction number R and overdispersion parameter k) were estimated. We estimated the reporting delay during the outbreak (Scenario 1). We also considered a counterfactual scenario with less effective interventions characterized by a longer reporting delay (Scenario 2). Each day, we estimated the risk of future cases under both scenarios. RESULTS: The values of R and k were estimated to be 1.30 (95% credible interval: 0.57,3.80) and 0.38 (0.12,1.20), respectively. The mean reporting delays considered were 2.5 days (Scenario 1) and 7.8 days (Scenario 2). The inferred probability of future cases occurring declined more quickly in Scenario 1 than Scenario 2. CONCLUSIONS: Following outbreak containment, rigorous control measures allowed the outbreak to be declared over quickly.

BACKGROUND: The index system for the evaluation of infectious disease specialist nurses’ core competence has not been established. DESIGN: A two-round Delphi survey was conducted to seek opinions from experts about the index system for the evaluation of infectious disease specialist nurses’ core competence. METHODS: The study adopted several research methods, including literature retrieval, theoretical analysis and qualitative research. Based on the above method, the draft of core competence evaluation index system of infectious disease specialist nurses was constructed. A Delphi survey was used for the study of 30 infectious disease experts from 8 provinces and cities around China. A modified recommendation for the Conducting and Reporting of Delphi studies (CREDES) was also used to guide this study. A STROBE checklist was used. RESULTS: The Core Competence Evaluation Index System of Infectious Disease Nurses is composed of 6 primary indicators, namely, Nursing Abilities for Infectious Diseases, Infection Prevention and Control Abilities, Responsiveness to Infectious Diseases, Professional Development Abilities, Communication and Management Abilities, and Professionalism and Humanistic Accomplishment, 16 secondary indicators and 47 tertiary indicators. The authority coefficient, judgment coefficient and familiarity degree of Delphi experts were 0.923, 0.933 and 0.913 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation index system of core competence of diseases specialist nurses is scientific and reliable. It can be reference for future training and assessment of Chinese infectious disease specialist nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Infectious disease specialist nurses are the main force for infectious disease nursing. Their core competence is related to the quality of infectious disease nursing and treatment. The core competence of the nurses is important for identification of training strategies and can be regarded as reference for nurse assessment and promotion. The construction of the index system is based on the consensus of infectious disease experts, which is not only helpful to standardize the training strategies and selection standards of infectious disease specialist nurses in the future, but also meet the society’s needs in clinical infectious disease nursing.","Wu, Chao; Wu, Ping; Li, Pei; Cheng, Feixia; Du, Yanling; He, Shizhe; Lang, Hongjuan",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376141/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06402-2,614

Tobacco smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death world-wide and a major risk factor for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections and appears to be related to poorer outcomes among those with COVID-19. Non-smokers with second-hand smoke exposure also experience significant adverse respiratory effects. Smoking imposes enormous health- and non-health-related costs to societies. The benefits of smoking cessation, in both prevention and management of respiratory disease, have been known for decades and, to this day, cessation support remains one of the most important cost-effective interventions that health professionals can provide to people who smoke. Cessation at any age confers substantial health benefits, even in smokers with established morbidities. As other treatments for chronic respiratory disease advance and survival rates increase, smoking cessation treatment will become even more relevant. While smoking cessation interventions are available, the offer of these by clinicians and uptake by patients remain limited.","McRobbie, Hayden; Kwan, Benjamin",Addiction,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140508/; https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15309,614

640220,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on epilepsy practice in India: A tripartite survey,2021-01-08,"Throughout March and April 2020, debate raged about how best to allocate limited intensive care unit (ICU) resources in the face of a growing COVID-19 pandemic. The debate was dominated by utility-based arguments for saving the most lives or life-years. These arguments were tempered by equity-based concerns that triage based solely on prognosis would exacerbate existing health inequities, leaving disadvantaged patients worse off. Central to this debate was the assumption that ICU admission is a valuable but scarce resource in the pandemic context. In this paper, we argue that the concern about achieving equity in ICU triage is problematic for two reasons. First, ICU can be futile and prolong or exacerbate suffering rather than ameliorate it. This may be especially true in patients with COVID-19 with emerging data showing that most who receive access to a ventilator will still die. There is no value in admitting patients with poor prognostic indicators to ICU to meet an equity target when intensive critical care is contrary to their best interests. Second, the focus on ICU admission shifts focus away from important aspects of COVID-19 care where there is greater opportunity for mitigating suffering and enhancing equitable care. We propose that the focus on equity concerns during the pandemic should broaden to include providing all people who need it with access to the highest possible standard of end-of-life care. This requires attention to culturally safe care in the following interlinked areas: palliative care, communication and decision support and advanced care planning.","Ballantyne, Angela; Rogers, Wendy A; Entwistle, Vikki; Towns, Cindy",J Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32571847/; https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106460,614

In spite of many reports about the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of some species of this genus, anticancer researches on one of the Iranian species S. litwinowii have not yet been conducted. The cytotoxic properties of total methanol extract of S. litwinowii and its fractions were investigated on different cancer cell lines including AGS, HeLa, MCF-7, PC12 and NIH 3T3. Meanwhile, the role of apoptosis in this toxicity was explored. The cells were cultured in DMEM medium and incubated with different concentrations of herb plant extracts. Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using propidium iodide staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). Scutellaria litwinowii inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among solvent fractions of S. litwinowii, the methylene chloride fraction was found to be more toxic compared to other fractions.

640993,Healthcare providers experience of working during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study,2020-10-06,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the advantages of student satisfaction with and functionality of three digital teaching concepts during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic compared to a conventional lecture setup. METHODS: This cross‐sectional study was a survey‐based e‐learning research among dental students in the clinical study phase of a department of prosthetic dentistry at a German university hospital. A total of 44 questions were answered in four main sections: 1. general technical components; 2. acceptance; 3. evaluation and functionality; and 4. overall evaluation and grades of the various digital concepts. The use of Zoom conference, livestream, and prerecorded PowerPoint was compared to the conventional lecture setup (control group/CG). Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test, followed by an exploratory data analysis and Cronbach's alpha test (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Students were very satisfied with the provision, quality, and benefit of the digital concepts. The asynchronous concept was significantly more satisfying than the synchronous concepts in many aspects but was less successful in interactions. In the overall evaluation and grading, the asynchronous concept was rated significantly better than the other synchronous concepts (p ≤ 0.007), followed by Zoom conference, conventional lecture (CG), and livestream, while Zoom conference and the conventional lecture showed no significant difference (p = 0.784). CONCLUSIONS: Students significantly preferred the asynchronous concept to the synchronous concepts. The results suggested that asynchronous concepts are an effective and functional form of distance education during a pandemic. In general, digital teaching concepts are currently widely accepted for maintaining university education.","Goob, Janosch; Erdelt, Kurt; Güth, Jan‐Frederik; Liebermann, Anja",J Dent Educ,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046898/,614

Mass gatherings take place when a large number of people from different locations visit a particular region during a short time period. Such activity plays a crucial role in the epidemic spread as traveling facilitates the spread of an epidemic between disparate locations and crowded conditions can accelerate the disease transmission. An additional component that affects disease spread is the seasonality in transmission. In this paper, we study the interplay between the periodic natures of seasonal transmission and of an annual mass gathering event. We find that the timing of the gathering relative to the peak in transmissibility can have a profound impact on the likelihood of an outbreak.","Xu, Fei; Connell McCluskey, C.",Math Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905600/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2019.03.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556418303894; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556418303894,614

Knowledge and practices acquired this way can rapidly become outdated. Providing high-quality care to patients requires surgeons to keep their knowledge up to date in line with evolving new evidence. The principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM) and its application to surgery, evidence-based surgery (EBS), are pivotal in updating and refining surgical practice. Changing from the conventional practice of surgical education to a structured evidence-based format requires a transformative process in all the levels of surgical practice encompassing trainees and trainers. Equally important is providing an optimal environment to review the evidence and deliver the surgical teaching and incorporate effective assessment tools to monitor the process. In this article, we revisit the levels of evidence and explore the different issues related to EBS such as barriers to EBS, incorporation of EBS to the surgical curriculum and discuss practical ways to implement EBS in the surgical curriculum.","Husnoo, Nilofer; Johnston, Judith; Harikrishnan, Athur",Indian J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334975/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-021-03038-z,614

641466,Antimicrobial Peptides and Physical Activity: A Great Hope against COVID 19,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: To understand a causal role of modifiable lifestyle factors in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression (a putative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] receptor) across 44 human tissues/organs, and in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity, we conducted a phenome-wide two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. METHODS: More than 500 genetic variants were used as instrumental variables to predict smoking and alcohol consumption. Inverse-variance weighted approach was adopted as the primary method to estimate a causal association, while MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) were performed to identify potential horizontal pleiotropy. RESULTS: We found that genetically predicted smoking intensity significantly increased ACE2 expression in thyroid (β=1.468, p=1.8×10(−8)), and increased ACE2 expression in adipose, brain, colon, and liver with nominal significance. Additionally, genetically predicted smoking initiation significantly increased the risk of COVID-19 onset (odds ratio=1.14, p=8.7×10(−5)). No statistically significant result was observed for alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates an important role of smoking, measured by both status and intensity, in the susceptibility to COVID-19.

It appears in November 2019 in Hubei province (in China), and more specifically in the city of Wuhan, then spreads in the whole world. As the number of cases increases with unprecedented speed, many parts of the world are facing a shortage of resources and testing. Faced with this problem, physicians, scientists and engineers, including specialists in Artificial Intelligence (AI), have encouraged the development of a Deep Learning model to help healthcare professionals to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images and to determine the severity of the infection in a very short time, with low cost. In this paper, we propose CVDNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify COVID-19 infection from normal and other pneumonia cases using chest X-ray images. The proposed architecture is based on the residual neural network and it is constructed by using two parallel levels with different kernel sizes to capture local and global features of the inputs. This model is trained on a dataset publically available containing a combination of 219 COVID-19, 1341 normal and 1345 viral pneumonia chest x-ray images. The experimental results reveal that our CVDNet. These results represent a promising classification performance on a small dataset which can be further achieve better results with more training data.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May–August 2020 among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases residing in a COVID-19 hotspot of urban Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and availing health services from primary care facility. Telephonic interviews of participants were conducted to determine their health literacy using HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviour as per World Health Organization recommendations, and compliance to prescribed pharmacological and physical activity recommendations for chronic disease. RESULTS: All the 605 diagnosed patients of chronic diseases availing services from primary care facility were contacted for the study, yielding response rate of 68% with 412 agreeing to participate. Insufficient health literacy was observed for 65.8% participants. Only about half of participants had scored above median for COVID-19 awareness (55.1%) and preventive behavior (45.1%). Health literacy was observed to be significant predictor of COVID-19 awareness [aOR: 3.53 (95% CI: 1.81–6.88)]; COVID-19 preventive behavior [aOR: 2.06, 95%CI; 1.14–3.69] and compliance to pharmacological management [aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.47–6.35] but not for physical activity.

643516,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dermatologic practice: an Italian survey,2021-05-14,"Biomarkers have important roles in various physiological functions and disease pathogenesis. As a nucleocytoplasmic DNA virus, Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) causes high economic losses in the mariculture industry. Aptamer-Q5-complexed major capsid protein (MCP) in the membrane of SGIV-infected cells can be used as a specific molecular probe to investigate the crucial events of MCP endocytosis into SGIV-infected host cells during viral infection. Chlorpromazine blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and MCP endocytosis into SGIV-infected cells decreased significantly when the cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine. The disruption of cellular cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin also significantly reduced MCP endocytosis. In contrast, inhibitors of key regulators of caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis, including genistein, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), myosin II, Rac1 GTPase, and protein kinase C (PKC), had no effect on MCP endocytosis. The endocytosis of the biomarker MCP is dependent on low pH and cytoskeletal actin filaments, as shown with various inhibitors (chloroquine, ammonia chloride, cytochalasin D). Therefore, MCP enters SGIV-infected host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is dependent on dynamin, cholesterol, low pH, and cytoskeletal actin filaments. This is the first report of a specific aptamer-based probe used to analyze MCP endocytosis into SGIV-infected host cells during viral infection. This method provides a convenient strategy for exploring viral pathogenesis and facilitates the development of diagnostic tools for and therapeutic approaches to viral infection.","Yu, Qing; Liu, Mingzhu; Wu, Siting; Wei, Xinxian; Xiao, Hehe; Yi, Yi; Cheng, Hao; Wang, Shaowen; Zhang, Qin; Qin, Qiwei; Li, Pengfei",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32636813/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01206,614

He was transferred to the designated hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. The patient was diagnosed as a mild COVID-19 case on January 16. After medical treatment, this patient recovered and left the hospital on February 18. Viral RNA from the specimen of the patient was extracted using the QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Amplicon-based enrichment and sequencing approach were applied. The viral genome was reverse-transcribed and amplified using ULSEN® 2019-nCoV Whole Genome Kit (Micro Future). The sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina Nextera® XT Library Prep Kit. The final viral-enriched libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The whole genome sequence of this COVID-19 virus strain, designated SCSR-455, was assembled and obtained using Geneious v11.0.3 (https://www.geneious.com). The published genomes from GISAID and the genome of SCSR-455 were aligned with the reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1, Genbank: NC_045512, GISAID: EPI_ISL_402125) (1) using MAFFT v7.4 (2). The maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny was estimated with IQ-TREE v1.6.12 (3) with 1000 bootstraps and the best-fit model autodetected. The genomes of SCSR-455 had the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 8782T and 28144C which represent the Pangolin A lineage (4). The A lineage was prevalent during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (5). So far, however, it has been less frequently detected than the B lineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SCSR-455 was located in the Pangolin lineage A.27 which was designated in February 2021. This lineage of COVID-19 viruses was first detected in Denmark on December 14, 2020 and then transmitted to several other countries, including Belgium, France, Netherlands, Nigeria, Rwanda, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), and Turkey (Figure 1). Apart from 8782T and 28144C, viruses in the A.27 lineage had 21 SNPs (A361G, C1122T, C2509T, A9204G, A11217G, C16466T, A18366G, A20262G, C21614T, G22468T, T22917G, A23063T, C23520T, C23525T, G23948T, G25218T, T25541C, C27247T, A28273T, G28878A, and G29742A) compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. The genomes of SCSR-455 shared all these lineage-defining SNPs with the A.27 lineage strains and also had another 6 SNPs, including C3096T, C5974T, C12241T, C16293T, C19895T, and C21658T. The genomes of 4 strains of the A.27 lineage, collected in France (EPI_ISL_934974), Rwanda (EPI_ISL_1020288), and the UK (EPI_ISL_769875 and EPI_ISL_769876), respectively, shared 26 SNPs with SCSR-455. These 4 strains were phylogenetically most closely related to SCSR-455 within the A.27 lineage (Figure 1). A total of 7 amino acid mutation sites (L18F, L452R, N501Y, A653V, H655Y, D796Y, and G1219V) that correspond to the features of the A.27 lineage were detected in the spike protein of SCSR-455. The A.27 is the first sub-lineage of the A lineage that evolved to obtain N501Y mutation in the spike protein, despite the amino acid mutation D614G which might increase viral transmissibility (6) not being identified. Residue 501 is a key contact residue within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N501Y mutation has been shown to enhance binding affinity to human and murine hACE2 (7–8). N501Y has been associated with some faster-growing COVID-19 virus lineages throughout the world (e.g., the UK lineage B.1.1.7, also known as the 501Y.V1;and the South African lineage B.1.351, also known as the 501Y.V2). The A.27 lineage shared only one amino acid mutation, N501Y, with the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 lineage. In Addition, the A.27 lineage obtained the L452R mutation, which might alter the antibody recognition sites, and D796Y, which might be associated with changes in ligand binding surface. The strain SCSR-455 is the first imported A.27 lineage variant in China. Previous investigations showed that the A lineage was less prevalent than the B lineage. Given the importance of N501Y in the sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, ongoing epidemiological and genomic surveillance are needed to monitor the potential expanded transmission of the A lineage. Further laboratory investigations are required to test the efficiency of the existing vaccines against this newly described A.27 lineage.","Liu, Li; Luo, Tao; Lei, Gaopeng; Feng, Yuliang; Zhao, Xiang; Yang, Huiping; Xu, Jianan; Pan, Ming; Zhou, Linlin",China CDC Wkly,https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2021.155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594977/,614

In this paper, we investigate the growth in employment between the eve of the Great Recession and the eve of COVID‐19 across several dimensions. We analyse which sectors, demographic groups and regions accounted for the rise. We also investigate how job ‘quality’ – in both financial and non‐financial terms – has changed. We find that almost all demographic groups and regions saw a rise in employment, especially those with low pre‐existing employment rates and those near the bottom of the income distribution. Hourly pay growth was very weak over the period, with the median actually slightly falling.

METHODS: One IgM(+) and IgG(−), 32 IgM(+) and IgG(+), 38 IgM(−) and IgG(+), and 40 IgM(−) and IgG(−) patients were included. Demographic data were collected. IgM and IgG antibodies, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocyte subsets in serum were determined at weeks 0, 2 and 4. RESULTS: The hs-CRP and IL-6 levels of all patients were within the normal ranges. The number of patients with all lymphocyte subset testing items within normal ranges was 12/110 (10.9%) at week 0, 15/110 (13.6%) at week 2 and 18/110 (16.4%) at week 4. The percentages of CD8 + cells, NK cells and B lymphocytes in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group were quite different from those in the IgM(−) and IgG(+) group and the IgM(−) and IgG(−) group, with much higher percentages of CD8 + cells and much lower percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Twelve IgM(+) patients in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group converted to IgM(−), and the percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes in these patients were significantly increased at week 4. CONCLUSIONS: The changes of serum IgM and IgG are closely related to immunity in patients in the recovery stage. However, immunity does not recover when the patients test negative for these antibodies.","Shen, Yinfeng; Ba, Yuanming; Hu, Yaling; Wang, Linqun; Li, Weinan",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385239/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00011-020-01429-8,614

Hospitals all over the world have reduced the number of non-emergency surgeries in order to utilize the staff and resources in a more efficient way. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is most transmitted via respiratory droplets, but risk of transmission is hugely increased while doing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). Laparoscopy remains the preferred surgical approach for most surgical indications. There is theoretical possibility of generation of aerosols contaminated with COVID-19 from leaked CO2 and smoke generation after energy device use. The aim of this paper is to review available evidence evaluating the risk of spread of COVID-19 during necessary laparoscopic procedures and to compile guidelines from relevant professional organizations to minimize this risk.","Gupta, Nikhil; Agrawal, Himanshu",Int J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.05.076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32479915/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919120304593; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919120304593?v=s5,614

In order to assist difficult triage decisions, clinicians require clear guidelines on how to prioritise patients. Existing guidelines show significant variability in their development, interpretation, implementation and an urgent need for a robust synthesis of published guidance. To understand how to manage which patients are admitted to ICU, and receive mechanical ventilatory support, during periods of high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic review was performed. Databases of indexed literature (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Global Health) and grey literature (Google.com and MedRxiv), published from 1 January until 2 April 2020, were searched. Search terms included synonyms of COVID-19, ICU, ventilation, and triage. Only formal written guidelines were included. There were no exclusion criteria based on geographical location or publication language. Quality appraisal of the guidelines was performed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II (AGREE II) and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument Recommendation EXcellence (AGREE REX) appraisal tools, and key themes related to triage were extracted using narrative synthesis. Of 1902 unique records identified, nine relevant guidelines were included. Six guidelines were national or transnational level guidance (UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, Italy, and Sri Lanka), with one state level (Kansas, USA), one international (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) and one specific to military hospitals (Department of Defense, USA). The guidelines covered several broad themes: use of ethical frameworks, criteria for ICU admission and discharge, adaptation of criteria as demand changes, equality across health conditions and healthcare systems, decision-making processes, communication of decisions, and guideline development processes. We have synthesised the current guidelines and identified the different approaches taken globally to manage the triage of intensive care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is limited consensus on how to allocate the finite resource of ICU beds and ventilators, and a lack of high-quality evidence and guidelines on resource allocation during the pandemic. We have developed a set of factors to consider when developing guidelines for managing intensive care admissions, and outlined implications for clinical leads and local implementation.","Tyrrell, Carina S B; Mytton, Oliver T; Gentry, Sarah V; Thomas-Meyer, Molly; Allen, John Lee Y; Narula, Antony A; McGrath, Brendan; Lupton, Martin; Broadbent, Jo; Ahmed, Aliko; Mavrodaris, Angelique; Abdul Pari, Anees Ahmed",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-215518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334908/,614

This is a complex interaction which involves the production of people capable of making technical advances, the physical opportunities for the deployment of those trained individuals in this task as well as cultural and social factors which will motivate the innovators to produce the advances we need to maintain the momentum of our continually improving situation. One particular aspect of the social situation which may be singled out for special attention is that of the ethics of the society in which people make and use the products of the innovation process. The ethical aspects of biotechnological activities has commanded a great deal of attention recently both from the professional and societal stake-holders. This paper, therefore examines in some detail the ethical aspects of the technology/society interface as it applies, in particular, to the development of animal and plant cell biotechnology. It focuses on the role of the regulatory agency and on the need for biotechnologists to acquire professional status so that they may develop a more trustworthy relationship with society.","Spier, R.E",J Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9828457/,614

At our university hospital (2012–2016), we retrospectively applied in 4245 women who had OGTT between 22 and 30 weeks of gestation (reference standard: WHO criteria) the proposals in which OGTT is performed only in high-risk women; in all (Option 1) or high-risk (Option 1-Sel) women with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 4.7–5.0 mmol/L; in all (Option 2) or high-risk (Option 2-Sel) women without history of HIP and with FPG 4.7–5.0 mmol/L. We also tested FPG measurement alone in all high-risk women. Measuring FPG alone had a sensitivity of 49% (95% confidence interval 45–54) applying universal screening. Option 2 appeared to have the best balance considering the needed OGTT (17.3%), sensitivity (72% (67–76)) and rates of a composite outcome (true negative cases: 10.6%, false positive cases: 24.4%; true positive cases: 19.5%; false negative cases: 10.2%). Consideration of a history of HIP and measuring first FPG can avoid more than 80% of OGTTs and identify women with the highest risk of adverse HIP-related events.","Nachtergaele, Charlotte; Vicaut, Eric; Tatulashvili, Sopio; Pinto, Sara; Bihan, Hélène; Sal, Meriem; Berkane, Narimane; Allard, Lucie; Baudry, Camille; Portal, Jean-Jacques; Carbillon, Lionel; Cosson, Emmanuel",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494289/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10030397,614

647852,COVID-19 Vaccination for Persons With Severe Mental Illnesses: An Indian Perspective,2021-08-24,"Objective: To summarize significant research contributions on managing pandemics with health informatics published in 2020. Methods: An extensive search using PubMed and Scopus was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published in 2020 that examined health informatics systems used during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The selection process comprised three steps: 1) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors; 2) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final selection of three best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. Results: Selected best papers represent the important and diverse ways that health informatics supported clinical and public health responses to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Selected papers represent four groups of papers: 1) Use of analytics to screen, triage, and manage patients; 2) Use of telehealth and remote monitoring to manage patients and populations; 3) Use of EHR systems and administrative systems to manage internal operations of a hospital or health system; and 4) Use of informatics methods and systems by public health authorities to capture, store, manage, and visualize population-level data and information. Conclusion: Health informatics played a critical role in managing patients and populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care and public health organizations both leveraged available information systems and standards to rapidly identify cases, triage infected individuals, and monitor population trends. The selected best papers represent a fraction of the body of knowledge stemming from COVID-19, most of which is focused on pandemic response.

648216,LB767 A multicenter analysis of patients using telemedicine for dermatological conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-30,"BACKGROUND The primary aim of this study was to compare the 25(OH)D level between patients with COVID-19 and the reference population. The secondary aim was to determine the association of 25(OH)D level with COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality. METHODS The COVID-19-positive group comprised 520 hospitalized patients and the reference population comprised 15,789 COVID-19-negative patients. The 25(OH)D level was categorized as vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D < 20 ng/mL) and severe vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D < 12 ng/mL). RESULTS While the incidence of vitamin D deficiency was similar in both groups, the incidence of severe vitamin D deficiency was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in the reference population (68.3% [n = 355] vs. 55.1% [n = 8,692], p < 0.001). Severe vitamin D deficiency in patients with COVID-19 was higher in the intensive care unit (ICU) group than in the non-ICU group (75.3% [n = 183] vs. 62% [n = 172], p = 0.001). The incidence of severe vitamin D deficiency was 65.4% (n = 280) in survivors and 81.5% (n = 75) in nonsurvivors (p = 0.003). However, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed no relationship between 25(OH)D level and in-hospital mortality. The median survival times of patients with and without severe vitamin D deficiency were not different, as shown by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. CONCLUSION Severe vitamin D deficiency is more common in patients with COVID-19 and may play a significant role in worsening the prognosis of these patients. However, the 25(OH)D level was not observed to effect COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality.","Güven, Mehmet; Gültekin, Hamza",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370620/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2021.1935361,614

More than three decades later, the goal has not been achieved, although spectacular advances have been made, with wild polio virus reported in only 2 countries in 2019. In spite of such progress, novel challenges have been added to the equation, most importantly outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio cases resulting from reversion to neurovirulence of attenuated vaccine virus, and insufficient coverage of vaccination. In the context of the latest discussions on malaria eradication, the GPEI experience provides more than a few lessons to the malaria field when considering a coordinated eradication campaign. The WHO Strategic Advisory Committee on Malaria Eradication (SAGme) stated in 2020 that in the context of more than 200 million malaria cases reported, eradication was far from reach in the near future and, therefore, efforts should remain focused on getting back on track to achieve the objectives set by the Global Technical Strategy against Malaria (2016–2030). Acknowledging the deep differences between both diseases and the stages they are in their path towards eradication, this paper draws from the history of GPEI and highlights relevant insights into what it takes to eradicate a pathogen in fields as varied as priority setting, global governance, strategy, community engagement, surveillance systems, and research. Above all, it shows the critical need for openness to change and adaptation as the biological, social and political contexts vary throughout the time an eradication campaign is ongoing.","González-Silva, Matiana; Rabinovich, N.

On day 7 after admission, despite the treatments, her respiratory and hemodynamic status deteriorated. Computed tomography revealed massive ascites and free air as well as wall defects of the transverse colon. An emergency laparotomy was undertaken in the intensive-care unit, and 17 cm of the transverse colon was resected. Histopathological findings revealed two perforation sites of 25 and 7 mm in diameter, necrosis of the intestinal mucosa around the perforation sites, and the microcirculatory thrombosis in the mesentery vessels which was suspected of having been induced by COVID-19-related coagulopathy.

Flavivirus infections underlie multiple human diseases and thus exert an immense burden on public health worldwide. Mounting evidence indicates that host autophagy is subverted to modulate the life cycles of flaviviruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The diverse interplay between autophagy and flavivirus infection not only regulates viral growth in host cells but also counteracts host stress responses induced by viral infection. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of autophagy in the flavivirus life cycle. We also discuss the impacts of virus-induced autophagy on the pathogeneses of flavivirus-associated diseases and the potential use of autophagy as a therapeutic target for curing flavivirus infections and related human diseases.","Ke, Po-Yuan",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19123940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30544615/,614

One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.","Bassolas, A.; Sousa, S.; Nicosia, V.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.08.20148742; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.08.20148742v1?rss=1,614

However, most studies have focused on the effect of COVID-19 on kidney function, whereas data regarding kidney function on the COVID-19 prognosis is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between eGFR on admission and the mortality rate of COVID-19. Methods We recruited 336 adult consecutive patients (male 57.1%, mean age 55.0 {+/-}15.9) that were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the tertiary care university hospital. Data were collected from the electronic health records of the hospital. On admission, eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula. Acute kidney injury was defined according to the KDIGO criteria. Binary logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between eGFR on admission and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Results Baseline eGFR was under 60 mL/min/1.73m2 in 61 patients (18.2%). Acute kidney injury occurred in 29.1% of the patients. In-hospital mortality was calculated as 12.8%. Age-adjusted and multivariate logistic regression analysis (p:0.005, odds ratio:0.974, CI:0.956-0.992) showed that baseline eGFR was independently associated with mortality. Additionally, age-adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in patients with an eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Conclusions On admission eGFR seems to be a prognostic marker for mortality in patients with COVID-19; We recommend to determine eGFR in all patients on admission and use it as an additional tool for risk stratification. Close follow-up should be warranted in patients with reduced eGFR.","Trabulus, S.; Karaca, C.; Balkan, I. I.; Dincer, M. T.; Murt, A.; Ozcan, S. G.; Karaali, R.; Mete, B.; Bakir, A.; Kuskucu, M.

Design Case control analysis with cases stratified by HIV-1 and tuberculosis status. Setting A single-centre observational case-control study of adults admitted to a South African hospital with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection or alternative diagnosis. Participants 104 adults with RT-PCR-proven SARS-CoV2 infection of which 55 (52.9%) were male and 31 (29.8%) HIV-1 co-infected. 40 adults (35.7% male, 30.9% HIV-1 co-infected) admitted during the same period with no RT-PCR or serological evidence of SARS-CoV2 infection and assigned alternative diagnoses. Additional in vitro data from prior studies of 72 healthy controls and 118 HIV-1 uninfected and infected persons participants enrolled to a prior study with either immune evidence of tuberculosis sensitization but no symptoms or microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Results Two or more co-morbidities were present in 57.7% of 104 RT-PCR proven COVID-19 presentations, the commonest being hypertension (48%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (39%), obesity (31%) but also HIV-1 (30%) and active tuberculosis (14%). Amongst patients dually infected by tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2, clinical features could be dominated by either SARS-CoV-2 or tuberculosis: lymphopenia was exacerbated, and some markers of inflammation (D-dimer and ferritin) elevated in singly SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were even further elevated (p less than 0.05). HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2 co-infection resulted in lower absolute number and proportion of CD4 lymphocytes, with those in the lowest peripheral CD4 percentage strata exhibiting absent or lower antibody responses against SARS-CoV2. Death occurred in 30/104 (29%) of all COVID-19 patients and in 6/15 (40%) of patients with coincident SARS-CoV-2 and tuberculosis. Conclusions In this South African setting, HIV-1 and tuberculosis are common co-morbidities in patients presenting with COVID-19. In environments in which tuberculosis is common, SARS-CoV-2 and tuberculosis may co-exist with clinical presentation being typical of either disease. Clinical suspicion of exacerbation of co-existent tuberculosis accompanying SARS-CoV-2 should be high.","du Bruyn, E.; Stek, C.; Daroowala, R.; Said-Hartley, Q.; Hsiao, M.; Goliath, R.

Because of its lethality, it is important to understand the current strain’s effects and mechanisms not only in the respiratory system but also in other affected organ systems as well. Past coronavirus outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV inflicted life-threatening acute kidney injuries (AKI) on their hosts leading to significant mortality rates, which went somewhat overlooked in the face of the severe respiratory effects. Recent evidence has emphasized renal involvement in SARS-CoV-2, stressing that kidneys are damaged in patients with COVID-19. The mechanism by which this virus inflicts AKI is still unclear, but evidence from other coronavirus strains may hold some clues. Two theories exist for the proposed mechanism of AKI: 1) the AKI is a secondary effect to reduced blood and oxygen levels causing hyperinflammation and 2) the AKI is due to cytotoxic effects. Kidneys express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 target receptor as well as collectrin, an ACE2 homologue that localizes to the primary cilium, an organelle historically targeted by coronaviruses. Although the available literature suggests that kidney damage is leading to higher mortality rates in patients with COVID-19, especially in those with preexisting kidney and cardiovascular diseases, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still being investigated. Here, we present brief literature review supporting our proposed hypothesis of a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection and cilia.","Buqaileh, Raghad; Saternos, Hannah; Ley, Sidney; Aranda, Arianna; Forero, Kathleen; AbouAlaiwi, Wissam A.",Physiol Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00015.2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855870/,614

Counteracting the activities of the E3 ligases, the deubiquitylating enzymes have been suggested as another important mechanism to modulate the ubiquitination process, and are implicated in cancer as well. In this article, we review the emerging roles of USP28 in cancer pathways as revealed by recent studies. We discuss the major mechanisms by which USP28 is involved in the cancer-related pathways, whereby USP28 regulates physiological homeostasis of ubiquitination process, DNA-damage response, and cell cycle during genotoxic stress. We further review the studies where USP28 was targeted for treating multiples cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, intestinal cancers, gliomas, and bladder cancer. As a result, the clinical significance of targeting USP28 for cancer therapy merits further exploration and demonstration.","Wang, Xiaofang; Liu, Zhiyi; Zhang, Li; Yang, Zhaozhi; Chen, Xingxing; Luo, Jurui; Zhou, Zhirui; Mei, Xin; Yu, Xiaoli; Shao, Zhimin; Feng, Yan; Fu, Shen; Zhang, Zhen; Wei, Dongping; Jia, Lijun; Ma, Jinli; Guo, Xiaomao",Cell Death Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-017-0208-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29415985/,614
650690,Primary drivers and psychological manifestations of stress in frontline healthcare workforce during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States,2021-01-10,"This paper argues that diverse disciplines within the human sciences have converged in identifying the conditions that human beings need to thrive and the programs, policies, and practices that are needed to foster well-being. In the interest of promoting this view, we suggest that this convergence might usefully be labeled “The Nurture Consilience.” We review evidence from evolutionary biology, developmental, clinical, and social psychology, as well as public health and prevention science indicating that, for evolutionary reasons, coercive environments promote a “fast” life strategy that favors limited self-regulation, immediate gratification, and early childbearing. However, this trajectory can be prevented through programs, practices, and policies that (a) minimize toxic social and biological conditions, (b) limit opportunities and influences for problem behavior, (c) richly reinforce prosocial behavior, and (d) promote psychological flexibility. The recognition of these facts has prompted research on the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of evidence-based interventions. To fully realize the fruits of this consilience, it is necessary to reform every sector of society. We review evidence that free-market advocacy has promoted the view that if individuals simply pursue their own economic well-being it will benefit everyone, and trace how that view led business, health care, education, criminal justice, and government to adopt practices that have benefited a small segment of the population but harmed the majority. We argue that the first step in reforming each sector of society would be to promote the value of ensuring everyone's well-being. The second step will be to create contingencies that select beneficial practices and minimizes harmful ones.","Biglan, Anthony; Johansson, Magnus; Van Ryzin, Mark; Embry, Dennis",Clin Psychol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858377/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272735820300817; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735820300817?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101893,614

The virus can reactivate, causing herpes zoster (HZ, shingles) and leading to significant morbidity but rarely mortality, although in immunocompromised hosts, VZV can cause severe disseminated and occasionally fatal disease. We discuss VZV diseases and the decrease in their incidence due to the introduction of live-attenuated vaccines to prevent varicella or HZ. We also focus on acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (FDA approved drugs to treat VZV infections), brivudine (used in some European countries) and amenamevir (a helicase-primase inhibitor, approved in Japan) that augur the beginning of a new era of anti-VZV therapy. Valnivudine hydrochloride (FV-100) and valomaciclovir stearate (in advanced stage of development) and several new molecules potentially good as anti-VZV candidates described during the last year are examined. We reflect on the role of antiviral agents in the treatment of VZV-associated diseases, as a large percentage of the at-risk population is not immunized, and on the limitations of currently FDA-approved anti-VZV drugs. Their low efficacy in controlling HZ pain and post-herpetic neuralgia development, and the need of multiple dosing regimens requiring daily dose adaptation for patients with renal failure urges the development of novel anti-VZV drugs.","Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672709/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26041132,614

The objective of this project was to determine the feasibility and potential benefits of an education initiative in which the principles of EOL care were taught to senior-level nursing students and practicing nurses. To assess feasibility, data regarding recruitment rates, retention rates, and implementation issues were collected. Workshop effectiveness was evaluated through use of the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium-Knowledge Assessment Test survey, which evaluates knowledge levels regarding EOL care principles. A mixed-effects linear model was used to test for changes from the preworkshop to postworkshop scores. Demographic information and satisfaction data were also collected. Nineteen students and 24 nurses participated (total N = 43). There was a statistically significant time difference (P = .0001), with the postworkshop scores being higher (43.5 ± 0.93) versus the preworkshop scores (41.2 ± 0.93). However, no statistically significant workshop date difference (P = .3146) emerged. Satisfaction data were positive. Retention for the second workshop was negatively affected by COVID-19.

Researchers quickly advanced in research to try to understand this COVID-19 and sough solutions for the front-line professionals fighting this fatal disease. One of the tools to aid in the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this disease is computed tomography (CT). CT images provide valuable information on how this new disease affects the lungs of patients. However, the analysis of these images is not trivial, especially when researchers are searching for quick solutions. Detecting and evaluating this disease can be tiring, time-consuming, and susceptible to errors. Thus, in this study, we aim to automatically segment infections caused by COVID19 and provide quantitative measures of these infections to specialists, thus serving as a support tool. We use a database of real clinical cases from Pedro Ernesto University Hospital of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The method involves five steps: lung segmentation, segmentation and extraction of pulmonary vessels, infection segmentation, infection classification, and infection quantification. For the lung segmentation and infection segmentation tasks, we propose modifications to the traditional U-Net, including batch normalization, leaky ReLU, dropout, and residual block techniques, and name it as Residual U-Net. The proposed method yields an average Dice value of 77.1% and an average specificity of 99.76%. For quantification of infectious findings, the proposed method achieves results like that of specialists, and no measure presented a value of ρ < 0.05 in the paired t-test.

The objective is to describe the demand-based series of RT-PCR determinations received at a Microbiology Service at a third-level reference hospital for a health area for three months spanning from the onset of the epidemic by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the total of the RT-PCR requested in the Microbiology Service analyzed from 02/25/2020 to 05/26/2020 (90 days) has been carried out. They have been grouped by epidemiological weeks and by the petitioner service. A descriptive analysis was carried out by age, gender and number of requests for each patient. In the tests carried out, a confidence level of 95% (p <0.05) was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 27,106 requests was received corresponding to 22,037 patients. Median age 53.7 (RIC 40.9-71.7) years, women: 61.3%. Proportion of patients with any positive RT-PCR: 14%. Of the total requests for RT-PCR, positive 3,710.

The current study aimed to evaluate patient-reported disease severity and quality of life in Arabic patients with psoriasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Arabic psoriatic patients were invited to complete an online survey that collected patients’ demographics, self-assessed Simplified Psoriasis Index (saSPI) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Disease severity and quality of life were compared in relation to patients’ demographics. Correlation between patient-reported measures was calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation test. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients with psoriasis, from 12 Arabic-speaking countries, participated in the study. The mean (95% CIs) saSPI-severity score was 10.9 (9.6–12.2). Female patients reported higher saSPI-psychosocial impact scores compared to males (P=0.04) while patients with longer disease duration reported higher saSPI-past history and interventions scores (P=0.0001). The mean (95% CIs) DLQI score was 11.2 (10.2–12.1). Patients with severe disease reported significantly higher DLQI scores [18.5 (10.5–2)] (P=0.0001). DLQI was strongly correlated with saSPI-psychosocial impact score (rho= 0.63).

As relevant literature about food-sourced vitamin increases, continuous synthesis is warranted. To supplement existing information, this perspective review discussed food-sourced vitamins for consumer diet and health needs, scoping from vitamin absorption, metabolic functions, utilization, to balancing nutritional requirements. Relevant literatures were identified through a search of databases like Google Scholar, Web of Science, the Interscience Online Library, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. We demonstrated that vitamins whether from plant- and animal-based sources are prerequisites for the metabolic functions of the human body. The fat- and water-soluble classification of vitamins remains consistent with their respective absorption and dissolution potentials, underpinned by numerous physiological functions. Vitamins, largely absorbed in the small intestine, have their bioavailability dependent on the food composition, its associated interactions, as well as alignment with their metabolic functions, which involves antioxidants, coenzymes, electron acceptor/donor, and hormones. Moreover, vitamin deficiencies, in every form, pose a serious threat to human health. Vitamin toxicities remain rare, but can still occur mainly from supplementation, although it appears much less in water-soluble vitamins of which some excesses get readily removed by the human body, different from the fat-soluble ones that are stored in tissues and organs. Besides discussions of absorption, transport, and cellular uptake of vitamins, this perspective review also included approaches to meeting vitamin requirements and therapeutic strategies against micronutrient deficiency and COVID-19.

However, it is still a challenging task due to the variability of pathological lung appearances and shapes. In this paper, we proposed a novel segmentation algorithm based on random forest (RF), deep convolutional network, and multi-scale superpixels for segmenting pathological lungs from thoracic CT images accurately. A pathological thoracic CT image is first segmented based on multi-scale superpixels, and deep features, texture, and intensity features extracted from superpixels are taken as inputs of a group of RF classifiers. With the fusion of classification results of RFs by a fractional-order gray correlation approach, we capture an initial segmentation of pathological lungs. We finally utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy to deal with segmentation refinement combining contour correction of left lungs and region repairing of right lungs. Our algorithm is tested on a group of thoracic CT images affected with interstitial lung diseases. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a high segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 96.45% and PPV of 95.07%. Compared with several existing lung segmentation methods, our algorithm exhibits a robust performance on pathological lung segmentation. Our algorithm can be employed reliably for lung field segmentation of pathologic thoracic CT images with a high accuracy, which is helpful to assist radiologists to detect the presence of pulmonary diseases and quantify its shape and size in regular clinical practices.","Liu, Caixia; Zhao, Ruibin; Xie, Wangli; Pang, Mingyong",Neural Process Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837245/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11063-020-10330-8,614

METHODS: Retrospective single-centre cohort study. Services location, IVIs scheduling, utilization of staff, data recording methods, ophthalmic examination and surgical procedures were analysed; a new Intravitreal Injection Centre (IVIC) was developed according to Lean principles. Mean number of daily IVIs performed, mean time between registration and discharge, mean turnover time in between patients, percentages of performed IVIs on the monthly scheduled IVIs and of patients rating their experience ⩾8/10 via standardized feedback questionnaires were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: The mean IVIs number per day increased from 20 ± 4.08 to 50 ± 7.07, and the mean time between registration and discharge of a patient decreased from 240 ± 14.14 to 60 ± 8.16 min (p = 0.00057 and p < 0.00001, respectively). Mean turnover time in between patients decreased from 10 ± 1.41 to 8 ± 2 min (p = 0.055).

The impact assessment is completed by means of a computable general equilibrium model as this allows quantification of both the direct and indirect economic and environmental impact of simulated shocks. The results show that different fiscal policy types can steer an economy into a more circular direction. However, depending on the policy type, the impact on the SOE’s macroeconomic structure and level of circularity differs. Furthermore, common claims attributed to a CE (e.g. local job creation or decreased import dependence) can be, but are not always, valid. Hence, policy-makers must prioritize their most important macroeconomic goals and opt for an according fiscal policy. Finally, this paper finds that the CO(2) equivalent emissions calculated from a production (or territorial) perspective increase, while they decrease from a consumption perspective. This is explained by the substitution of international activities by local circular activities. This comparative analysis advocates for the consumption approach to assess the CE’s impact on CO(2) equivalent emissions.

654598,Harm reduction in an emergency response to homelessness during South Africa’s COVID-19 lockdown,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) is the main target of most hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific entry inhibitors. Unfortunately, these agents also block NTCP transport of bile acids into hepatocytes, and thus have the potential to cause adverse effects. We aimed to identify small molecules that inhibit HBV entry while maintaining NTCP transporter function. METHODS: We characterized a series of cyclosporine (CsA) derivatives for their anti-HBV activity and NTCP binding specificity using HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP and primary human hepatocytes. The four most potent derivatives were tested for their capacity to prevent HBV entry, but maintain NTCP transporter function. Their antiviral activity against different HBV genotypes was analysed. RESULTS: We identified several CsA derivatives that inhibited HBV infection with a sub-micromolar IC(50). Among them, SCY446 and SCY450 showed low activity against calcineurin (CN) and cyclophilins (CyPs), two major CsA cellular targets. This suggested that instead, these compounds interacted directly with NTCP to inhibit viral attachment to host cells, and have no immunosuppressive function. Importantly, we found that SCY450 and SCY995 did not impair the NTCP-dependent uptake of bile acids, and inhibited multiple HBV genotypes including a clinically relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first example of small molecule selective inhibition of HBV entry with no decrease in NTCP transporter activity. It suggests that the anti-HBV activity can be functionally separated from bile acid transport. These broadly active anti-HBV molecules are potential candidates for developing new drugs with fewer adverse effects.

It carries a grave prognosis and a high early mortality rate. It is often distinguished from other similar pulmonary pathologies based on the clinical course, laboratory findings, bronchoalveolar lavage testing, and pathology report. We detail a 77-year-old lady with no prior pulmonary disease, smoking history, or occupational and environmental exposures present to the emergency department found to be in acute hypoxic respiratory failure with impressive progressive radiographic findings. The presumptive diagnosis of Hamman-Rich syndrome was made based on a combination of factors after ruling out other similar clinical entities, especially in the setting of an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Qian; Raza, Ahmad; Chan, Vincent; Minalyan, Artem; Madara, John",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32963907/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9866,614

Clinical assessment tools represent a practical method to measure the impact of treatment on disease activity and on the quality of life of patients. However, the use of these tools in the LA clinical practice setting is limited. METHODS: A selected panel of Latin American experts in fields related to atopic dermatitis were provided with a series of relevant questions to address prior to the multi-day conference. Within this conference, each narrative was discussed and edited by the entire group, through numerous drafts and rounds of discussion, until a consensus was achieved. RESULTS: The panel proposes specific and realistic recommendations for implementing control tools for AD care in LA. In creating these recommendations, the authors strove to address all barriers to the widespread use of these tools. CONCLUSION: This article includes a narrative analysis of barriers to AD control in LA and provides necessary recommendations to integrate and increase the use of validated AD control assessment tools throughout the region.","Sanchez, Jorge; Cherrez-Ojeda, Ivan; Galvan, Cesar; Garcia, Elizabeth; Hernández-Mantilla, Natalia; Londoño Garcia, Angela; McElwee, Elizabeth; Rico Restrepo, Mariana; Rivas, Enrique; Hidalgo, Benjamin",Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449071/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13555-021-00595-9,614

Zinc biofortification of wheat has been realized in the field by ergonomically applying Zn to foliar two and three times, which increased grain Zn from 18 mg/kg (control) to 34 and 64 mg/kg. A total of 180 quails were divided into six groups, each containing 30 birds, and fed diets containing wheat grain with either 18, 34, or 64 mg/kg with or without zinc picolinate (ZnPic) supplementation. Bodyweight, feed intake, feed efficiency, and cold carcass weights were greater (P = 0.0001) when the quails were fed a diet containing the biofortified wheat-containing 64 mg Zn/kg. Nitrogen, ash, Ca, P, Zn, Cu, and Fe retentions were greater with the Zn-biofortified wheat-containing 64 mg Zn/kg (P ≤ 0.026). The nutrient excretions were low with feeding a diet containing biofortified wheat-containing 64 mg Zn/kg (P ≤ 0.023). Serum, liver, and heart Zn concentrations increased with feeding biofortified wheat-containing 64 mg Zn/kg (P ≤ 0.002). Thigh meat Fe concentrations increased with increasing Zn concentrations of the wheat samples used (P = 0.0001), whereas the liver Cu concentrations decreased with feeding the wheat-containing 64 mg Zn/kg (P = 0.004). The Zn-biofortified wheat-containing greater Zn concentrations, particularly 64 mg Zn/kg, is a good replacement for corn in the poultry diet as long as its availability and low cost for better performance, greater digestibility, and elevated tissue Zn and Fe concentrations.","Sahin, Nurhan; Kucuk, Osman; Orhan, Cemal; Savasli, Erdinc; Cakmak, Ismail; Sahin, Kazim",Biol Trace Elem Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02955-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637103/,614

The awareness of the scientific and public community is enormous. But what about the sense of all these undertakings and what can be learned about the future for a better understanding? These questions were answered with established bibliometric analyses of the time until the avalanche of publications unfolded. METHODS: Chronological, geographical aspects of publication output on coronavirus were also evaluated under the influence of epidemiological and socio-economic parameters. RESULTS: The trend in publication and citation numbers shows the strong influence of the past pandemics SARS and MERS with an untypical decline afterward. Research is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary over time. The USA and China, as the countries with the highest number of publications, are being displaced by other countries in the consideration of socio-economic and epidemiological aspects, which shows the effect of regional interest in corona research. A significant correlation was found between the number of SARS cases per country and related publications, while no correlation was found for MERS cases and articles.

Current data suggest a low probability of airborne transmission of the virus in open environments and a higher probability in closed ones, particularly in hospitals or quarantine facilities. However, the potential diffusion of the virus in open environments, especially using particulate matter (PM) as a transport carrier, generated concern in the exposed populations. Several authors found a correlation between the exceeding of the PM10 concentration limits in some Italian cities and the prevalence of Covid-19 cases detected in those areas. This study investigated the potential presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on a representative series of PM samples collected in the province of Padua in Northeastern Italy during the first wave of COVID pandemic. Forty-four samples of PM2.5 and PM10 were collected between February 24 and March 3, 2020 and analyzed with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The experimental results did not indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the outdoor PMs, thus confirming the low probability of virus airborne transmission through PM.","Pivato, A.; Amoruso, I.; Formenton, G.; Di Maria, F.; Bonato, T.; Vanin, S.; Marion, A.; Baldovin, T.",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894607/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721021999; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721021999?v=s5,614

This paper presents machine learning based prognostic model for providing early warning to the individuals for COVID-19 infection using the health care data set. In the present work, a prognostic model using Random Forest classifier and support vector regression is developed for predicting the susceptibility of COVID-19 infection and it is applied on an open health care data set containing 27 field values. The typical fields of the health care data set include basic personal details such as age, gender, number of children in the household, marital status along with medical data like Coma score, Pulmonary score, Blood Glucose level, HDL cholesterol etc. An effective preprocessing method is carried out for handling the numerical, categorical values (non-numerical), missing data in the health care data set. Principal component analysis is applied for dimensionality reduction of the health care data set. From the classification results, it is noted that the random forest classifier provides a higher accuracy as compared to Support vector regression for the given health data set. Proposed machine learning approach can help the individuals to take additional precautions for protecting against COVID-19 infection. Based on the results of the proposed method, clinicians and government officials can focus on the highly susceptible people for limiting the pandemic spread. Methods- In the present work, Random Forest classifier and support vector regression techniques are applied to a medical health care dataset containing 27 variables for predicting the susceptibility score of an individual towards COVID-19 infection and the accuracy of prediction is compared. An effective preprocessing is carried for handling the missing data in the health care data set. Principal Component Analysis is carried out on the data set for dimensionality reduction of the feature vectors.

656091,Using Log Data to Measure Provider EHR Activity at a Cancer Center during Rapid Telemedicine Deployment,2021,"Abstract The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1, which first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997, achieved bird-to-human transmission, causing a severe disease with high mortality to humans [18]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 637 cases were reported in fifteen countries, including 378 deaths, corresponding to a case fatality rate of nearly 60% [19]. Avian influenza continues to be one of the deadliest diseases that jumps from animals to humans. Epidemiologists believe that it is likely to cause the next major global pandemic that could kill millions of people. The 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) demonstrated that international air travel can significantly influence the global spread of an infectious disease. This paper studies the effects of air travel on the spread of avian influenza from Asian and Australian cities to the United States. A two-city mathematical model involving a pandemic strain is used to derive the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ), which determines if the disease will spread and persist ( R 0 > 1 ) or go extinct ( R 0 < 1 ). Real air travel data is used to model the disease spread by individuals who are susceptible to or are infected with pandemic avian influenza. Analysis of the two-city model helps understand the dynamics of the spread of pandemic influenza when the cities are connected by air travel. Understanding these effects can help public health officials and policy-makers select the appropriate disease control measures. Also, it can provide guidance to decision-makers on where to implement control measures while conserving precious resources.","Tuncer, Necibe; Le, Trang",International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874548214000079; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874548214000079,614
656365,The COVID-19 outbreak: Crucial role the psychiatrists can play,2020-03-20,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Although viral respiratory tract infections are, in general, more severe in patients with CF compared with the general population, a small number of studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 does not cause a worse infection in CF. This is surprising since comorbidities including preexisting lung disease have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several recent studies provide insight into why SARS-CoV-2 may not produce more severe outcomes in CF. First, ACE and ACE2, genes that play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, have some variants that are predicted to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, mRNA for ACE2 is elevated and mRNA for TMPRSS2, a serine protease, is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells. Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells but would increase conversion of angiotensin II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1–7, which is anti-inflammatory. Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased TMPRSS2 would reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Second, many CF patients are treated with azithromycin, which suppresses viral infection and lung inflammation and inhibits the activity of furin, a serine protease. Finally, the CF lung contains high levels of serine protease inhibitors including ecotin and SERPINB1, which are predicted to reduce the ability of TMPRSS2 to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into airway epithelial cells. Thus, a variety of factors may mitigate the severity of SARS-CoV-2 in CF.","Stanton, Bruce A.; Hampton, Thomas H.; Ashare, Alix",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668165/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00225.2020,614

Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody, has been repurposed for Covid-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in Covid-19 are lacking. Methods We conducted a phase 2 trial of low-dose tocilizumab in hospitalized adult patients with Covid-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) >= 40 mg/L who did not require mechanical ventilation. Dose cohorts were determined by a trial Operations Committee, stratified by CRP and epidemiologic risk factors. A range of doses from 40 to 200 mg (low-dose tocilizumab) was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24-48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Outcomes were compared with retrospective controls with Covid-19. Correlative studies evaluating host antibody response were performed in parallel. Findings A total of 32 patients received low-dose tocilizumab. This cohort had improved fever resolution (75.0% vs. 34.2%, p = 0.001) and CRP decline (86.2% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.001) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration, as compared to the retrospective controls (N=41). The probabilities of fever resolution or CRP decline did not appear to be dose-related in this small study (p=0.80 and p=0.10, respectively). Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (15.6%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (IQR, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (15.6%) patients. Correlative biological studies demonstrated that tocilizumab-treated patients produced anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies comparable to controls. Interpretation Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with Covid-19. Results of this trial and its correlative biological studies provide rationale for a randomized, controlled trial of low-dose tocilizumab in Covid-19.","Strohbehn, G. W.; Heiss, B. L.; Rouhani, S.

We show that this nanobody potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, including the B.1.351 variant, and cross-neutralizes SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the nanobody against SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.351 variant in a human ACE2 transgenic mouse model.

It has received worldwide attention due to its virulence and high rate of infection. So far, several drugs have experimented against SARS-CoV-2, but the failure of these drugs to specifically interact with the viral protease necessitates urgent measure to boost up researches for the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Papain-like protease (PLpro) of the viral polyproteins is essential for maturation and infectivity of the virus, making it one of the prime targets explored for SARS-CoV-2 drug design. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ~ 50,000 natural compounds retrieved from IBS database against COVID-19 PLpro using computer-aided drug design. Based on molecular dock scores, molecular interaction with active catalytic residues and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations studies, STOCK1N-69160 [(S)-2-((R)-4-((R)-2-amino-3-methylbutanamido)-3-(4-chlorophenyl) butanamido) propanoic acid hydrochloride] has been proposed as a novel inhibitor against COVID-19 PLpro. It demonstrated favourable docking score, the free energy of binding, interacted with key amino acid residues necessary for PLpro inhibition and also showed significant moderation for parameters investigated for ADME/tox (Adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicological) properties. The edge of the compound was further established by its stability in MD simulation conducted for 30 ns employing GROMACS software. We propose that STOCK1N-69160 is worth further investigation for preventing SARS-CoV-2.

While PCR is the gold standard method for detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infection, alternative high-throughput diagnostic tests are of significant value to meet universal testing demands. Here, we describe a new design of the MasSpec Pen technology integrated to electrospray ionization (ESI) for direct analysis of clinical swabs and investigate its use for COVID-19 screening. The redesigned MasSpec Pen system incorporates a disposable sampling device refined for uniform and efficient analysis of swab tips via liquid extraction directly coupled to a ESI source. Using this system, we analyzed nasopharyngeal swabs from 244 individuals including symptomatic COVID-19 positive, symptomatic negative, and asymptomatic negative individuals, enabling rapid detection of rich lipid profiles. Two statistical classifiers were generated based on the lipid information aquired. Classifier 1 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive from asymptomatic PCR-negative individuals, yielding cross-validation accuracy of 83.5%, sensitivity of 76.6%, and specificity of 86.6%, and validation set accuracy of 89.6%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 85.3%. Classifier 2 was built to distinguish symptomatic PCR-positive patients from negative individuals including symptomatic PCR-negative patients with moderate to severe symptoms and asymptomatic individuals, yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 78.4% accuracy, specificity of 77.21%, and sensitivity of 81.8%.

Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. This study examines determinants of COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) based on publicly sourced data from January 1 to December 18, 2020, and sociodemographic and rural-urban continuum data from the US Census Bureau. Nonspatial negative binomial Poisson regression and geographically weighted Poisson regression were applied to estimate the global and local relationships between the CFR and predictors—rural-urban continuum, political inclination, and race/ethnicity in 2407 rural counties. The mean COVID-19 CFR among rural counties was 1.79 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.07; 95% CI 1.73-1.84) higher than the total US counties (M = 1.69, SD = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.65-1.73). Based on the global NB model, CFR was positively associated with counties classified as “completely rural” (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12-1.39) and “mostly rural” (IRR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.15-1.38) relative to “mostly urban” counties. Nonspatial regression indicates that COVID-19 CFR increases by a factor of 8.62, 5.87, 2.61, and 1.36 for one unit increase in county-level percent Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian/Pacific Islanders, respectively. Local spatial regression shows CFR was significantly higher in rural counties with a higher share of BIPOC in the Northeast and Midwest regions, and political inclination predicted COVID-19 CFR in rural counties in the Midwest region. In conclusion, spatial and racial/ethnic disparities exist for COVID-19 CFR across the US rural counties, and findings from this study have implications for public health.

MicroRNA is found participated in this process. In this study we developed a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation cell model on macrophages and a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation mouse model. It was found that during inflammation, microRNA-9 was increased, accompanied with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Down-regulation of microRNA-9 inhibited the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines, promoted the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and induced the remission of organ damage, showing a protective effect in inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis combined with luciferase reporter assay showed that SIRT1 was the target gene of microRNA-9. Transfection of microRNA-9 inhibitor could increase the level of SIRT1 and decrease the activation of NF-κB pathway in macrophages. Myeloid specific sirt1 knockout mice were included and we found that lack of SIRT1 in mice macrophages led to aggravated inflammation, cell apoptosis and organ injury, and eliminated the protective property of microRNA-9 inhibitor. In conclusion, we demonstrated that inhibition of microRNA-9 could alleviate inflammation through the up-regulation of SIRT1 and then suppressed the activation of NF-κB pathway. This is a meaningful explore about the specific mechanism of microRNA-9 in inflammation.","Cao, Mengyuan; Zhang, Wanfu; Li, Junjie; Zhang, Julei; Li, Lincheng; Liu, Mingchuan; Yin, Wen; Bai, Xiaozhi",Arch Biochem Biophys,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.12.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003986118308373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30552873/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986118308373,614

Declaring public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) is a cornerstone of the IHR. Here we review how PHEIC are formally declared, the diseases for which such declarations have been made from 2007 to 2020 and justifications for such declarations. KEY FINDINGS: Six events were declared PHEIC between 2007 and 2020: the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Ebola (West African outbreak 2013–2015, outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo 2018–2020), poliomyelitis (2014 to present), Zika (2016) and COVID-19 (2020 to present). Poliomyelitis is the longest PHEIC. Zika was the first PHEIC for an arboviral disease. For several other emerging diseases a PHEIC was not declared despite the fact that the public health impact of the event was considered serious and associated with potential for international spread. RECOMMENDATIONS: The binary nature of a PHEIC declaration is often not helpful for events where a tiered or graded approach is needed. The strength of PHEIC declarations is the ability to rapidly mobilize international coordination, streamline funding and accelerate the advancement of the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics under emergency use authorization. The ultimate purpose of such declaration is to catalyse timely evidence-based action, to limit the public health and societal impacts of emerging and re-emerging disease risks while preventing unwarranted travel and trade restrictions.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Osman, Sarah",J Travel Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284964/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa227,614

Major categories of organisms include bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. Microbiological methods combined with clinical symptoms, additional laboratory tests, and imaging techniques are used in combination to distinguish a true disease-associated infection from colonization with normal flora or other conditions, such as malignancies, inflammatory disorders, or autoimmune disorders, all of which have unique therapies and prognoses for the patient. Laboratories combine the use of traditional microscopy and culture methods, with a rapidly evolving set of molecular and proteomic techniques. Given the increase in immunocompromised patients due to an increase in transplantations, the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic, and the use of immunosuppressive agents to treat autoimmune disorders, diagnosis of microbial infections continues to be essential for many patients.","Frank, K.

We aimed to explore whether the observed increase in suicides in the United States, Canada and Australia in the 5 months following the 2014 suicide of the popular actor Robin Williams was also observed in England and Wales. METHOD: We used interrupted time-series analysis and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages (SARIMA) model to estimate the expected number of suicides during the 5 months following Williams’ death using monthly suicide count data for England and Wales from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2013–2014. RESULTS: Compared with the observed 2051 suicide deaths in all age groups from August to December 2014, we estimated that we would have expected 1949 suicides over the same period, representing no statistically significant excess.

Both theories make claims of biological warfare attempts. According to the available scientific evidence, these claims are groundless. However, like the episodes of biological warfare during the mid-twentieth century, the spread of these present-day conspiracy theories reflects a series of longstanding and damaging trends in the international scene which include deep mistrust, animosities, the power of ideologies such as nationalism, and the sacrifice of truth in propaganda campaigns. Also, the threats associated with biological warfare, bioterrorism, and the accidental leakage of deadly viruses from labs are real and growing. Thus, developing a better global governance of biosafety and biosecurity than exists at present is an urgent imperative for the international community in the broader context of a looming Cold War II. For such a governance, an ethical framework is proposed based upon the triple ethical values of transparency, trust, and the common good of humanity.","Nie, Jing-Bao",J Bioeth Inq,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11673-020-10025-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840850/,614

The ability to use biological agents in warfare is prohibited by the Biological and Toxin Weapon Convention. Bioterrorism is defined as the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria or other agents used to cause illness or death in people, but also in animals or plants. It is aimed at creating casualties, terror, societal disruption, or economic loss, inspired by ideological, religious or political beliefs. The success of bioterroristic attempts is defined by the measure of societal disruption and panic, and not necessarily by the sheer number of casualties. Thus, making only a few individuals ill by the use of crude methods may be sufficient, as long as it creates the impact that is aimed for. The assessment of bioterrorism threats and motives have been described before. Biocrime implies the use of a biological agent to kill or make ill a single individual or small group of individuals, motivated by revenge or the desire for monetary gain by extortion, rather than by political, ideological, religious or other beliefs. The likelihood of a successful bioterrorist attack is not very large, given the technical difficulties and constraints. However, even if the number of casualties is likely to be limited, the impact of a bioterrorist attack can still be high. Measures aimed at enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and capacities alongside training and education will improve the ability of society to combat ‘regular’ infectious diseases outbreaks, as well as mitigating the effects of bioterrorist attacks.","Jansen, H.J.; Breeveld, F.J.; Stijnis, C.; Grobusch, M.P.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14641732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890710/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14641732; https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12699,614

Obesity plays a central role in the development of T2DM. The inflammation originating from obese adipose tissue develops systemically and contributes to insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction and hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia can also contribute to chronic, low-grade inflammation resulting in compromised immune function. In this review, we explore how the trafficking of innate and adaptive immune cells under inflammatory condition is dysregulated in T2DM. We particularly highlight the obesity-related accumulation of leukocytes in the adipose tissue leading to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction and resulting in hyperglycemia and consequent changes of adhesion and migratory behavior of leukocytes in different vascular beds. Thus, here we discuss how potential therapeutic targeting of leukocyte trafficking could be an efficient way to control inflammation as well as diabetes and its vascular complications.","Pezhman, Laleh; Tahrani, Abd; Chimen, Myriam",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.624184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692997/,614

Adequate knowledge, practice, and attitudes (KPA) toward COVID-19 among physicians at the frontline defense against the COVID-19 pandemic may enhance their ability to avoid the risk of self-infection, decrease mortality, and provide adequate medical care service in this pandemic. This study aimed to assess KPA toward COVID-19 among physicians in Jordan and Palestine. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using an online survey conducted from 10 April to 26 April 2020 among Jordan and Palestine physicians. Invitations were sent to physician groups on Facebook and WhatsApp. This survey contains 36-items, divided into four main sections to assess the participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, practice, and attitude about COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 454 physicians participated in this study. The mean score of basic knowledge was 4.4 ± 0.8 (range 2–4). There were significant differences between basic knowledge mean scores among physicians in different professional degrees and physicians in various health sectors (P=0.0315, P=0.0137, respectively). The mean scores of self-protection measures, were 6.1 ± 1.1 (range 3–7) and measures if physician self-suspected of COVID-19 were 9.9± 1.1 (range 5–11). The mean score of attitudes toward COVID-19 was 41.5 ± 3.3 (range 21–45) and significantly related to the age and different experience years (P=0.0022, P=0.0077, respectively). CONCLUSION: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, physicians from Jordan and Palestine showed adequate KPA toward COVID-19. There was a significant difference in knowledge level and attitude between physicians. Policymakers and physicians should keep continuous educational activities, training, and follow-up updates during this pandemic.","Al Demour, Saddam; Ababneh, Mera A; Al-Taher, Raed N; Alrabadi, Adel F; Jaradat, Ahmad F; Abushamma, Faris A; Al-Hadidi, Fadi A; Al-Rawashdeh, Baeth M; Ihmeidan, Mohammad A; Abubaker, Ahmad K; Al-Zubi, Mohammad T",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s294221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469347/,614

TMPRSS2 is gateway for SARS CoV-2 entry into the host cell. It causes proteolytic activation of spike protein and discharge of the peptide into host cell. The TMPRSS2 inhibition could be one of the approaches to stop the viral entry, therefore, interaction pattern and binding energies for Fisetin and TMPRSS2 have been explored in the present study. TMPRSS2 peptide was used for homology modelling and then for further study. Molecular docking score and MMGBSA Binding energy of Fisetin was better than Nafamostat, a known inhibitor of TMPRSS2. Post docking MM-GBSA free energy for Fisetin and Nafamostat was −42.78 and −21.11 kcal/mol, respectively. Fisetin forms H bond with Val 25, His 41, Lys 42, Lys 45, Glu 44, Ser186. Nafamostat formed H bonds with Lys 85, Asp 90, Asp 203. RMSD plots of TMPRSS2, TMPRSS2-Fisetin and TMPRSS2-Nafamostat complex showed stable profile with very small fluctuation during entire simulation of 150 ns. Significant decrease in TMPRSS2-Fisetin and TMPRSS2-Nafamostat complex fluctuation occurred around His 41, Glu 44, Gly 136, Ser 186 in RMSF study.

Consequently, many have shown a growing interest and receptivity to the expansion of telehealth models to help meet these demands. Electronic consultations (eConsults) are a telehealth modality that allow for a non-face-to-face asynchronous consultation between a primary care provider (PCP) and a specialist aimed at facilitating specialist input without the need for a patient visit. The aim of this case study is to describe eConsults, how they differ from traditional in person models of care and other models of telemedicine and to review the evidence related to the effectiveness of eConsults by PCPs and clinicians from multiple specialties at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. We have worked to develop an infrastructure, delivery system integration, and care model adaptations that aim to improve delivery system performance by ensuring proper care in appropriate settings and lowering costs through reduced utilization. Lastly, we have increased care coordination, improved collaboration and better care transitions through strengthening of relationships between community-based PCPs and academic medical center-based specialists. This work has resulted in cost savings to patients and positive provider satisfaction.","Thompson, Matthew A.; Fuhlbrigge, Anne L.; Pearson, Duane W.; Saxon, David R.; Oberst-Walsh, Linda A.; Thomas, John F.",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759622/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211005303,614

We evaluated the long-term effects of infection control interventions on the incidence densities of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and CRA complex infection, and the rates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteremia (AB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis at the Changhua Christian Hospital from January 2002 to December 2013. Interventions for infection control were implemented from 2002 to 2009 (period 1). From 2010 to 2013 (period 2), infection control programs were improved by in-service education and a hand hygiene campaign to prepare for international and national hospital accreditation. The effectiveness of infection and antibiotic control programs was assessed according to the incidence densities of HAI and CRA complex, rates of CRA complex and of AB, chlorhexidine consumption density, and defined daily dose of antibiotics. RESULTS: The incidence density of HAI decreased from 4.56‰ to 1.52‰ from periods 1 to 2 (P < 0.001). Likewise, the incidence of AB decreased from 177.79 to 137.76 per person-years per 100,000 admissions (P < 0.001). The incidence density of CRA complex ranged from 3.17–7.38‰. The chlorhexidine consumption density increased from 5.5 to 45.5 L per 1000 patient-days (P < 0.001). The consumption of piperacillin-tazobactam was lower in period 2 than in period 1 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Education for infection control programs, hand hygiene campaigns, and antibiotics control programs may decrease the incidence density of AB and HAI, and may help control CRA complex infection.","Chen, C.-H.; Lin, L.-C.; Chang, Y.-J.; Liu, C.-E.; Soon, M.-S.",Med Mal Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X15001146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028525/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmal.2015.04.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X15001146,614

Therefore, patients with chronic illnesses who need regular rehabilitation have been victims of the pandemic process. Because of their fear of being infected, they were deprived of the chance of their symptoms being rehabilitated. Therefore, it is extremely important to rehabilitate individuals with chronic illnesses in need of rehabilitation through telerehabilitation. In this study, we aimed to show the effect of Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises to be applied through telerehabilitation on eye movements, vision, and quality of life in a patient suffering from diplopia due to multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been found that Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises improve the quality of life and reduce the complaints of diplopia in MS patients with diplopia. In addition, the patient verbally stated that his balance increased after Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises. As a result, Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises are a rehabilitation method that gives positive results in the treatment of diplopia and it is recommended to apply this method via telerehabilitation.","Dogru-Huzmeli, Esra; Duman, Taskin; Cakmak, Ayse Idil; Aksay, Ufuk",Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763810/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05194-2,614
664975,Decreases in Hepatitis C Testing and Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-10,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportune time to evaluate the efficacy of traditional medicine. Many clinical studies involving AYUSH systems are being initiated and registered with Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI) since last few months. The present work is an analysis of different characteristics of these studies on the basis of available datasets. METHOD: ology: COVID-19 related clinical studies involving the healthcare systems of AYUSH, registered on CTRI between 1(st) February 2020 and 24(th) August 2020, were searched. They were analysed as per different characteristics such as registration month, study sites, aim, sample size, population, setting, sponsorship, intervention and comparators, duration & outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 197 AYUSH studies were registered on CTRI of which majority (n=113) were from Ayurveda, with another nine of them with an intra-AYUSH collaboration. The highest number of studies were registered in month of June (n=57). Maximum study sites were in Maharashtra (n=65). From the 197 total studies, only six were observational studies, with 191 being interventional studies. As an outcome, majority of the studies aimed at recovery (n=112). Majority of studies (n=105) were Government of India sponsored and proposed in AYUSH setting (n=107). The proportion of comparative studies was more than single arm studies. Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) was the most frequently mentioned drug. CONCLUSION: Our analysis revealed some interesting characteristics of the registered studies such as use of platform trial design, system specific criteria for assessment and personalized interventions. Though it was not possible to evaluate the quality of these studies in view of the limited dataset used for trial registration, we could notice variations in important characteristics like sample size, treatment arms, comparator used and study duration according to the primary aim of the studies. Overall, the present review underlines the formidable efforts of AYUSH sector in combating COVID-19 outbreak.","Bhapkar, Vedvati; Sawant, Tanuja; Bhalerao, Supriya",J Ayurveda Integr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262559/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0975947620301030; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2020.10.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0975947620301030?v=s5,614

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of contracting COVID-19, but this risk has been mitigated through the use of personal protective equipment such as N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFRs). At times the high demand for FFRs has exceeded supply, placing HCWs at increased exposure risk. Effective FFR decontamination of many FFR models using ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been well-described, and could maintain respiratory protection for HCWs in the face of supply line shortages. Here, we detail the construction of an ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI) device using previously existing components available at our institution. We provide data on UV-C dosage delivered with our version of this device, provide information on how users can validate the UV-C dose delivered in similarly constructed systems, and describe a simple, novel methodology to test its germicidal effectiveness using in-house reagents and equipment. As similar components are readily available in many hospitals and industrial facilities, we provide recommendations on the local construction of these systems, as well as guidance and strategies towards successful institutional implementation of FFR decontamination.","Schnell, Eric; Karamooz, Elham; Harriff, Melanie J.; Yates, Jane E.; Pfeiffer, Christopher D.; Smith, Stephen M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34297764/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255123,614

Early clinical experiences have demonstrated the wide spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 presentations, including various reports of atypical presentations of COVID-19 and possible mimic conditions. This article summarises the current evidence surrounding atypical presentations of COVID-19 including neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, otorhinolaryngology and geriatric features. A case from our hospital of pneumocystis pneumonia initially suspected to be COVID-19 forms the basis for a discussion surrounding mimic conditions of COVID-19. The dual-process model of clinical reasoning is used to analyse the thought processes used to make a diagnosis of COVID-19, including consideration of the variety of differential diagnoses. While SARS-CoV-2 is likely to remain on the differential diagnostic list for a plethora of presentations for the foreseeable future, clinicians should be cautious of ignoring other potential diagnoses due to availability bias. An awareness of atypical presentations allows SARS-CoV-2 to be a differential so that it can be appropriately investigated. A knowledge of infectious mimics prevents COVID-19 from overshadowing other diagnoses, hence preventing delayed diagnosis or even misdiagnosis and consequent adverse outcomes for patients.","Coleman, Jamie J; Manavi, Kaveh; Marson, Ella J; Botkai, Adam H; Sapey, Elizabeth",Postgrad Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32522844/; https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-137979,614

These fees might just augment league revenues. Integrity fees have different consequences if they are placed on a sports book’s handle or hold. We model one possible consequence of an integrity fee placed on the handle, that sports books might be motivated to avoid pushes, after which they have no hold but face a tax liability. One approach moves to half-point lines which eliminate pushes but might be second best in terms of betting market efficiency. As a case study, we describe the characteristics of recent betting lines in four North American sports. Based on predicted pushes, actual pushes, half-point lines, and the intertemporal correlation between the annual number of pushes and the annual number of half-point lines, it appears that sports books already actively set lines that avoid pushes and could easily adjust to half-point lines motivated by integrity fees.","Depken, Craig A.; Gandar, John M.",East Econ J,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41302-020-00179-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424045/,614
666775,The Role of Medical Students During COVID-19 Era. A Review,2021-02-08,"Extensive extrapulmonary damages in a dozen of organs/systems, including the central nervous system (CNS), are reported in patients of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Three cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been reported as a direct consequence of COVID-19. In spite of the scarce data for establishing a definitive link between COVID-19 and PD, some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the cases reported. They, however, do not fit well with the clinical findings reported for COVID-19 patients, in general, and for the PD cases reported, in particular. Given the importance of this potential connection, we present here a molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis that explains well these findings and will serve to explore the potential CNS damage in COVID-19 patients. The model explaining the cascade effects from COVID-19 to CNS is developed by using bioinformatic tools. It includes the post-translational modification of host proteins in the lungs by viral proteins, the transport of modified host proteins via exosomes out the lungs, and the disruption of protein-protein interaction in the CNS by these modified host proteins. Our hypothesis is supported by finding 44 proteins significantly expressed in the CNS which are associated with PD and whose interactions can be perturbed by 24 host proteins significantly expressed in the lungs. These 24 perturbators are found to interact with viral proteins and to form part of the cargoes of exosomes in human tissues. The joint set of perturbators and PD-vulnerable proteins form a tightly connected network with significantly more connections than expected by selecting a random cluster of proteins of similar size from the human proteome. The molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis presented here provides several routes for the cascading of effects from the lungs of COVID-19 patients to PD. In particular, the disruption of autophagy/ubiquitination processes appears as an important mechanism that triggers the generation of large amounts of exosomes containing perturbators in their cargo, which would insult several PD-vulnerable proteins, potentially triggering Parkinsonism in COVID-19 patients.","Estrada, Ernesto",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066091/,614

The aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on device-measured physical activity (PA), sedentary time, sleep and self-regulation; and to determine whether PA and sleep are related to self-regulation problems during the lockdown. Methods: PA, sedentary time and sleep were assessed using accelerometry in the week in which the Spanish national state of alarm was declared (n = 21). Parents reported preschooler’s self-regulation difficulties (internalizing and externalizing) before (n = 268) and during the lockdown (n = 157) by a validated questionnaire. Results: Preschoolers showed a decrease in total PA (mean difference [MD] = −43.3 min per day, 95% CI −68.1 to −18.5), sleep efficiency (MD = −2.09%, 95% CI −4.12 to −0.05), an increase in sedentary time (MD = 50.2 min per day, 95% CI 17.1 to 83.3) internalizing (MD = 0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28) and externalizing (MD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.44) problems. Preschoolers who met the World Health Organization recommendations for PA had lower internalizing scores than non-active peers (MD = −1.28, 95% CI −2.53 to −0.03).

We aimed to describe the epidemiological and demographic features of COVID-19 outside Wuhan. Methods A single-center case series of 136 consecutive (from January 16 to February 17, 2020) patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou, China, was retrospectively analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. Results Of the 136 patients (median age, 49 years; interquartile range [IQR], 33–63 years; range, 0.3–83 years), 91 (67%) had been to Wuhan or contacted persons from Wuhan. Forty-five (33.1%) were familial clusters. The median incubation period was 6 days (IQR: 4–11 days). All children had an exact exposure history, family members with COVID-19, and “Mild/Moderate” symptoms at admission. Among the 64 elderly patients, 14 (21.9%) had no exposure history, and 43 (67.2%) had a chronic illness. All 11 (8.1%) “Severe/Very severe” illness at onset cases and 5 (3.7%) fatal cases were elderly patients. The duration from symptom onset to admission was positively correlated with the duration from symptom onset to endpoint. Overall, patients with a longer incubation period had more severe outcomes. Conclusion As high-risk susceptible groups, strong protection should be implemented for children and the elderly. Universal screening should be performed for people with a clear exposure history, even lacking apparent symptoms. Given the rapid progression of COVID-19, people should be admitted quickly following symptom onset.","Zhao, Chenkai; Xu, Yueqin; Zhang, Xu; Zhong, Yaping; Long, Li; Zhan, Wenzhi; Xu, Tingting; Zhan, Chen; Chen, Yuehan; Zhu, Jinghai; Xiao, Wei; He, Miao",J Infect Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591163/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120305232?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120305232,614

The manufacture of vaccines from pathogenic avian influenza viruses by traditional methods is not feasible for safety reasons as well as technical issues. Strategies adopted to overcome these issues include the use of reverse genetic systems to generate reassortant strains, the use of baculovirusexpressed haemagglutinin or related non-pathogenic avian influenza strains, and the use of adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity. In clinical trials, conventional surfaceantigen influenza virus vaccines produced from avian viruses have proved poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive populations. Adjuvanted or whole-virus preparations may improve immunogenicity and allow sparing of antigen.","Stephenson, Iain; Nicholson, Karl G; Wood, John M; Zambon, Maria C; Katz, Jacqueline M",Lancet Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309904011053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15288823/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309904011053,614

A striking characteristic of COVID-19 infection in humans is the highly variable host response and the diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from clinically asymptomatic to severe immune reactions leading to hospitalization and death. Here we used a 3D genomic approach to analyse blood samples at the time of COVID diagnosis, from a global cohort of 80 COVID-19 patients, with different degrees of clinical disease outcomes. Using 3D whole genome EpiSwitch® arrays to generate over 1 million data points per patient, we identified a distinct and measurable set of differences in genomic organization at immune-related loci that demonstrated prognostic power at baseline to stratify patients with mild forms of illness and those with severe forms that required hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) support. Further analysis revealed both well established and new COVID-related dysregulated pathways and loci, including innate and adaptive immunity; ACE2; olfactory, Gβψ, Ca2+ and nitric oxide (NO) signalling; prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the acute inflammatory cytokine CCL3, and the T-cell derived chemotactic cytokine CCL5. We identified potential therapeutic agents for mitigation of severe disease outcome, with several already being tested independently, including mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and tacrolimus) and general immunosuppressants (dexamethasone and hydrocortisone). Machine learning algorithms based on established EpiSwitch® methodology further identified a subset of 3D genomic changes that could be used as prognostic molecular biomarker leads for the development of a COVID-19 disease severity test.","Hunter, Ewan; Koutsothanasi, Christina; Wilson, Adam; Santos, Francisco C.; Salter, Matthew; Powell, Ryan; Dring, Ann; Brajer, Paulina; Egan, Benedict; Westra, Jurjen W.; Ramadass, Aroul; Messer, William; Brunton, Amanda; Lyski, Zoe; Vancheeswaran, Rama; Barlow, Andrew; Pchejetski, Dmitri; Robbins, Peter A.; Mellor, Jane; Akoulitchev, Alexandre",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.14.435295,614

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A hypothesis-based post-hoc analysis of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population diagnosed with ME/CFS from 12 independent clinical sites of a Phase III trial was performed to evaluate the effect of rintatolimod therapy based on disease duration. The clinical activity of rintatolimod was evaluated by exercise treadmill tolerance (ETT) using a modified Bruce protocol. The ITT population (n = 208) was divided into two subsets of symptom duration. Patients with symptom duration of 2–8 years were identified as the Target Subset (n = 75); the remainder (<2 year plus >8 year) were identified as the Non-Target Subset (n = 133). Placebo-adjusted percentage improvements in exercise duration and the vertical rise for the Target Subset (n = 75) were more than twice that of the ITT population. The Non-Target Subset (n = 133) failed to show any clinically significant ETT response to rintatolimod when compared to placebo. Within the Target Subset, 51.2% of rintatolimod-treated patients improved their exercise duration by ≥25% (p = 0.003) despite reduced statistical power from division of the original ITT population into two subsets. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of ETT from a Phase III trial has identified within the ITT population, a subset of ME/CFS patients with ≥2 fold increased exercise response to rintatolimod. Substantial improvement in physical performance was seen for the majority (51.2%) of these severely debilitated patients who improved exercise duration by ≥25%. This magnitude of exercise improvement was associated with clinically significant enhancements in quality of life. The data indicate that ME/CFS patients have a relatively short disease duration window (<8 years) to expect a significant response to rintatolimod under the dosing conditions utilized in this Phase III clinical trial. These results may have direct relevance to the cognitive impairment and fatigue being experienced by patients clinically recovered from COVID-19 and free of detectable SARS-CoV-2.

669476,Were pregnant women more affected by COVID-19 in the second wave of the pandemic?,2021-04-14,"In this paper, we report on an intervention across continents and disciplines that brought together differently positioned students in South Africa and the USA. A collaboration between our classes—an introductory Geographic Information Systems (GIS) class in South Africa and a composition class in the United States—was facilitated and investigated by us. The point of departure of the intervention was to service socially just and anti-racist pedagogies through experimentation. Drawing on posthumanist, feminist, and new materialist theory, we investigate the hauntings of several prejudices and stereotypical tropes that foster racism. We link the concept of hauntology to Plumwood’s (1993) theorization of dualisms. We then draw a cartography of geomatics education in South Africa, focusing on the subjectification of geomatics graduates in particular and engineering graduates in general. We then zoom to our collaboration, and focus on several interactions amongst the cohorts to show instances of hauntings that perpetuate anti-Black, anti-Muslim, and related silences. We find that analysis of dualisms can highlight racist hauntings, and can also provide guidance on how to flatten hierarchies. Our transdisciplinary activism allows us to harness the positivity of difference to trouble binaries. We conclude with some thoughts on pandemic pedagogy in an unequal world.","Motala, Siddique; Stewart, Kristian D.",Can,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42330-021-00153-7,614
669637,COVID-19 pandemic and dental practice in Ghana,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND: As is the case around the globe, the Danish chiropractic community appears to be an active service provider for the athletic sub-population. However, a paucity of evidence elucidating the experiences, perceptions, and practices of individuals who identify as ‘sports chiropractors’ complicates strategic development efforts. METHODS: A sequential mixed-methods study was conceptualized in which interview responses from seven purposefully selected stakeholders provided context and informed a national descriptive survey exploring practice characteristics and opinions regarding sports chiropractic among Danish chiropractors. RESULTS: Thematic highlights included divided opinions on the criteria that define a sports chiropractor, the role of a chiropractor functioning beyond the clinic setting, and the need for a structured approach to developing sports chiropractic as a legitimate sub-specialty. The survey response rate was 34.9% (227 of 651), with 27% of responders identifying as a ‘sports chiropractor’. Compared to non-sports chiropractors, sports chiropractors engaged in a significantly higher level of interprofessional practice (3.8 versus 2.7 partners), in particular medical doctors (p = 0.016) and personal trainers (p < 0.001). Whether participants identified as a sports chiropractor or not, there was consensus that a high-quality post-graduate qualification and continued education was important. Generally speaking, the framing of sports chiropractic into a protected title was not a priority. CONCLUSION: The Danish sports chiropractor tends to be male, has a specialist education and engages other chiropractors, medical practitioners and professional trainers more often as practice partners than generalist chiropractors. The position of the sports chiropractor as a ‘knowledgeable expert’ was seen as more important than establishing a protected title. Experiential training appears to be an untapped resource for developing real-world competency and gaining greater professional exposure. Given the potential for development across Europe, more focus is required on a strategic plan for embedding chiropractic professionals in inter-professional athletic health and performance practice settings.

OBJECTIVE: To enrich the understanding of mental health crisis care in the United Kingdom, this study explores views on crisis resolution teams (CRTs) expressed on Twitter. We aim to identify the similarities and differences among views expressed on Twitter compared with interviews and focus groups. METHODS: We used Twitter’s advanced search function to retrieve public tweets on CRTs. A thematic analysis was conducted on 500 randomly selected tweets. The principles of refutational synthesis were applied to compare themes with those identified in a multicenter qualitative interview study. RESULTS: The most popular hashtag identified was #CrisisTeamFail, where posts were principally related to poor quality of care and access, particularly for people given a personality disorder diagnosis. Posts about CRTs giving unhelpful self-management advice were common, as were tweets about resource strains on mental health services. This was not identified in the research interviews. Although each source yielded unique themes, there were some overlaps with themes identified via interviews and focus groups, including the importance of rapid access to care. Views expressed on Twitter were generally more critical than those obtained via face-to-face methods. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional qualitative studies may underrepresent the views of more critical stakeholders by collecting data from participants accessed via mental health services. Research on social media content can complement traditional or face-to-face methods and ensure that a broad spectrum of viewpoints can inform service development and policy.","Chilman, Natasha; Morant, Nicola; Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor; Wackett, Jane; Johnson, Sonia",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185017/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25742,614

In this work, we develop a tensor method to predict the evolution of epidemic trends for many regions simultaneously. We construct a 3-way spatio-temporal tensor (location, attribute, time) of case counts and propose a nonnegative tensor factorization with latent epidemiological model regularization named STELAR. Unlike standard tensor factorization methods which cannot predict slabs ahead, STELAR enables long-term prediction by incorporating latent temporal regularization through a system of discrete-time difference equations of a widely adopted epidemiological model. We use latent instead of location/attribute-level epidemiological dynamics to capture common epidemic profile sub-types and improve collaborative learning and prediction. We conduct experiments using both county- and state-level COVID-19 data and show that our model can identify interesting latent patterns of the epidemic. Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of our method and show superior performance compared to the baselines, achieving up to 21% lower root mean square error and 25% lower mean absolute error for county-level prediction.","Kargas, Nikos; Qian, Cheng; Sidiropoulos, Nicholas D.; Xiao, Cao; Glass, Lucas M.; Sun, Jimeng",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758769/,614
672351,Meaningful Learning Experiences in Everyday Life During Pandemics. A Qualitative Study,2021-05-07,"Spectroscopy-based techniques are emerging diagnostic and surveillance tools for mosquito-borne diseases. This review has consolidated and summarised recent research in the application of Raman and infrared spectroscopy techniques including near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy for malaria and arboviruses, identified knowledge gaps, and recommended future research directions. Full-length peer-reviewed journal articles related to the application of Raman and infrared (near- and mid-infrared) spectroscopy for malaria and arboviruses were systematically searched in PUBMED, MEDILINE, and Web of Science databases using the PRISMA guidelines. In text review of identified studies included the methodology of spectroscopy technique used, data analysis applied, wavelengths used, and key findings for diagnosis of malaria and arboviruses and surveillance of mosquito vectors. A total of 58 studies met the inclusion criteria for our systematic literature search. Although there was an increased application of Raman and infrared spectroscopy-based techniques in the last 10 years, our review indicates that Raman spectroscopy (RS) technique has been applied exclusively for the diagnosis of malaria and arboviruses. The mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) technique has been assessed for the diagnosis of malaria parasites in human blood and as a surveillance tool for malaria vectors, whereas the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique has almost exclusively been applied as a surveillance tool for malaria and arbovirus vectors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The potential of RS as a surveillance tool for malaria and arbovirus vectors and MIRS for the diagnosis and surveillance of arboviruses is yet to be assessed. NIRS capacity as a surveillance tool for malaria and arbovirus vectors should be validated under field conditions, and its potential as a diagnostic tool for malaria and arboviruses needs to be evaluated. It is recommended that all 3 techniques evaluated simultaneously using multiple machine learning techniques in multiple epidemiological settings to determine the most accurate technique for each application. Prior to their field application, a standardised protocol for spectra collection and data analysis should be developed. This will harmonise their application in multiple field settings allowing easy and faster integration into existing disease control platforms. Ultimately, development of rapid and cost-effective point-of-care diagnostic tools for malaria and arboviruses based on spectroscopy techniques may help combat current and future outbreaks of these infectious diseases.","Goh, Brendon; Ching, Koek; Soares Magalhães, Ricardo J.; Ciocchetta, Silvia; Edstein, Michael D.; Maciel-de-Freitas, Rafael; Sikulu-Lord, Maggy T.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886567/,614

The intra and intermolecular interactions which exist within these compounds are analyzed by different methods namely the topological analysis AIM, ELF and the reduced gradient of the density. These approaches make it possible in particular to study the properties of hydrogen bonds. The highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels are constructed and the corresponding frontier energy gaps are determined to realize the charge transfer within the molecule. The densities of state diagrams were determined to calculate contributions to the molecular orbitals. The molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are determined to give a visual representation of charge distribution of these ligands and to provide information linked to electrophilic and nucleophilic sites localization.

Indoor air pollution is a problem of global environmental concern as well. Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a reactive oxygen species that plays important role in bacteria/virus inactivation and pollutant degradation. In this study, we found that commercially available filters typically deployed in air purifier and air conditioning units, impregnated with Rose Bengal (RB) as a 1O2 sensitizer, can be used for heterogeneous gas-phase generation of 1O2. It was confirmed that irradiation of the RB filter under oxygen gas stream produced 1O2, which was measured using furfuryl alcohol trapping method followed by HPLC analysis. It was also observed that the amount of 1O2 generated increases as the light intensity increased. Similarly, the sensitizer loading also positively influenced the 1O2 generation. The heterogeneous gas-phase generation of 1O2 can find potential applications in air purifier and air conditioning units for the purpose of bacteria/virus inactivation and/or pollutant degradation thereby improving indoor air quality.","Sunday, Michael Oluwatoyin; Sakugawa, Hiroshi",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972034715X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745862/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972034715X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141186,614

Different coping strategies may reduce or enhance the strengths between cyberbullying experience and mental health problems. In this study, we examined the correlations between cyberbullying involvement and loneliness among a group of children and adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic in China, focusing on investigating the protecting effect of the resilient coping strategy. The results demonstrated that 86.68% of the students were not involved in cyberbullying activities, 8.19% were victims only, 1.89% was perpetrators only, and 3.24% were both victims and perpetrators. Compared with the non-involved, the victims-only group had a significantly higher degree of reported loneliness and a lower score of resilient coping, while the differences of the other groups were not significant. Resilient coping strategy can significantly reduce loneliness and play a mediating role between cyberbullying victimization and loneliness, but such mitigating effect was relatively weak.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 10, 2020, to February 18, 2020. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province were included, retrospectively. Quantitative CT measurements of pulmonary opacities including volume, density, and location were extracted by deep learning algorithm. Dynamic evolution of these measurements was investigated from symptom onset (day 1) to beyond day 15. Comparison was made between severity groups. RESULTS: A total of 484 patients (median age of 47 years, interquartile range 33–57) with 954 CT examinations were included, and each was assigned to one of the three groups: asymptomatic/mild (n = 63), moderate (n = 378), severe/critically ill (n = 43). Time series showed different evolution patterns of CT measurements in the groups. Following disease onset, posteroinferior subpleural area of the lung was the most common location for pulmonary opacities. Opacity volume continued to increase beyond 15 days in the severe/critically ill group, compared with peaking on days 13–15 in the moderate group. Asymptomatic/mild group had the lowest opacity volume which almost resolved after 15 days. The opacity density began to drop from day 10 to day 12 for moderately ill patients. CONCLUSIONS: Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity and their evolution on CT varied with disease severity in COVID-19. These findings are valuable in understanding the nature of the disease and monitoring the patient’s condition during the course of illness. KEY POINTS: • Volume, density, and location of the pulmonary opacity on CT change over time in COVID-19. • The evolution of CT appearance follows specific pattern, varying with disease severity.

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R(0), for that model. Applying the [Formula: see text] formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible [Formula: see text] for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a “tunneling” effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.","Oraby, Tamer; Tyshenko, Michael G.; Maldonado, Jose Campo; Vatcheva, Kristina; Elsaadany, Susie; Alali, Walid Q.; Longenecker, Joseph C.; Al-Zoughool, Mustafa",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82873-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558571/,614

676149,A Geriatric Psychiatry Virtual Rotation during Covid-19,2020-05-15,"AIM: To explore nurses’ experiences in natural disaster response. BACKGROUND: Nurses are key to disaster response. There is a growing body of qualitative research exploring this emerging nursing issue. However, there is a need to synthesise and summarise this body of knowledge to identify the overarching elements of how nurses experience working in disaster situations to reflect on their experiences so that we may help shape future clinical practice, research and education. DESIGN: Qualitative meta‐synthesis. METHOD: Following PROSPERO guidelines (Moher et al., 2015), an exhaustive and systematic literature search and quality appraisal was undertaken in December 2019 to reveal nurses’ experiences during natural disaster response. Sandelowski and Barroso's systematic retrieval, analysis and interpretation of findings method was used to produce a meta‐summary of findings from 10 papers evaluating experiences across 9 disasters. A meta‐aggregation was used to synthesise the findings from the studies and was methodically quality assessed with PRISMA and CASP. RESULTS: Our findings aggregated data from 42 sub‐themes, into the following four themes to capture nurses’ experiences after responding to disasters. These included agile response; leadership and innovative problem solving; building resilience; positive communication and need for psychological/emotional support. DISCUSSION: This meta‐synthesis provides evidence to illustrate nurses’ resilience and leadership capabilities as means to manage and perceive their disaster relief response. Factors such as emotional intelligence, capacity to react to changing situations, to manage scant resources in extreme situations were highlighted in nurses practising in highly stressful environments. Managers can use these examples to support ways to improve disaster management policies, but also, to engage in support for their staff. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The role of nursing staff in disaster rescue is receiving significant attention. Understanding nurses’ experiences during disaster rescue can help future leaders to improve capacity to respond and nursing preparedness through education, training and management, but also for continuing emotional support after the event.","Xue, Chao‐Li; Shu, Yu‐Sheng; Hayter, Mark; Lee, Amanda",J Clin Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869888/,614
676251,An Experimental Education Project for Consultations of Older Adults during the Pandemic and Healthcare Lockdown,2021-04-06,"INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have reported evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected patients with underlying comorbidities. Our study aims to evaluate the impact of both cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities on a high-risk population with COVID-19 infection and coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to those without CAD. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients who tested COVID-19 positive via reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. We compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without CAD. Population demographics, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with inpatient mortality. RESULTS: A final sample population of 355 patients was identified, 77 of which had a known diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Our study population had a higher proportion of females, and those with CAD were significantly older. The rates of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as well as heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly higher in the CAD population. Lactate dehydrogenase was the only inflammatory marker significantly lower in the CAD group, while troponin and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher in this population. Patients with CAD also had significantly higher inpatient mortality (31% vs 20%, P = 0.046) and need for renal replacement therapy (33% vs 11%, P < 0.0001) compared to the non-CAD group. However, only age [odds ratio 1.041 (1.017-1.066), P = 0.001] was significantly associated with mortality in the overall population after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities, while the presence of CAD was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with CAD and COVID-19 have higher rates of comorbidities, inpatient mortality and need for renal replacement therapy compared to their non-CAD counterparts. However, CAD in itself was not associated with mortality after adjusting for other covariates, suggesting that other factors may play a larger role in the increased mortality and poor outcomes in these patients.","Peterson, Eric; Lo, Kevin Bryan; DeJoy, Robert; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gul, Fahad; Albano, Jeri; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Amanullah, Aman; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel",Coron Artery Dis,https://doi.org/10.1097/mca.0000000000000934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732512/,614

The incidence of viral causes of gastroenteritis, enteroaggregative/enteropathogenic/enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Cyclospora cayetanensis decreased sharply after shelter-in place took effect, whilst Salmonella, Campylobacter, shiga toxin-producing E. coli (O157 and non-O157) and other bacterial and parasitic causes of gastroenteritis were largely unaffected. Findings suggest community spread of viral gastroenteritis, pathogenic E. coli (except for shiga toxin-producing E. coli), Shigella, and Cyclospora are more susceptible to changes associated with shelter-in-place than other gastrointestinal pathogens.","Bulterys, P.

677855,P.40 An audit of anaesthetic practice and associated neonatal outcomes for category 1 caesarean sections during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-06-09,"PURPOSE: Airway management is a key objective in adapted electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent infection. The objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness of a modified ventilation procedure designed to reduce aerosol-generating bag-mask ventilation (BMV) and isolate possible droplets while maintaining adequate respiratory gas values in ECT sessions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study analyzed the results of the modified protocol applied over a month. Adaptations entailed preoxygenation and extension of the voluntary hyperventilation (VHV) time for two minutes before anesthesia induction, asking patients to hyperventilate with oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and while wearing a face mask. Thereafter, vigorous hyperventilation was avoided, and patients were only assisted with tightly sealed BMV until emergence from anesthesia, isolating the ventilation by using a single-use plastic device. Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (TcPCO(2)) were recorded throughout the session. RESULTS: The study included 74 sessions of bilateral ECT with the modified ventilation protocol in 15 subjects. After VHV, the mean SpO(2) increase was 2.12±2.14%, and the mean TcPCO(2) decrease was 4.05±2.98 mmHg. TcPCO(2) values at the moment of stimulus administration were 2.22±3.07 mmHg below pre-ECT values. The mean EEG seizure was 38.70±17.03 s, and postictal suppression was 68.31± 34.58% and 2.13±0.75 on a 0–3 scale. Brief desaturation (SpO(2) <90) of 4–5 seconds duration was observed in 4 sessions. CONCLUSION: This modified ventilation protocol was effective during COVID-19, and it did not elicit significant side effects. In addition to avoiding vigorous BMV, it induced moderate hypocapnia, which has been tied to seizure optimization and less hypercapnia during the apnea period.","de Arriba-Arnau, Aida; Dalmau Llitjos, Antònia; Soria, Virginia; Labad, Javier; Menchón, José Manuel; Urretavizcaya, Mikel",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s303877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045858/,614

678394,"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on institutional delivery, neonatal admissions and prematurity: a reflection from Lagos, Nigeria",2021-04-26,"Foodborne parasites have long been a neglected group of pathogens, as they often have insidious, chronic effects, rather than being acute diseases, and they are often associated with impoverished or marginalized populations. In addition, due to the long incubation period for most foodborne parasites, source attribution is often difficult, if not impossible. However, global trends have enabled foodborne parasites to emerge in different populations in new locations, transmitted through different food types, and sometimes with unexpected symptoms. This emergence of foodborne parasites has brought them into focus. In this chapter, six foodborne parasites are used as examples on emergence: Echinococcus multilocularis is spreading to new locations; Cryptosporidium spp. are beginning to be associated not only with water, but also with salads; Trypanosoma cruzi is being manifest with acute disease due to foodborne transmission, particularly transmitted with juices; Trichinella spp. have become less of a burden regarding transmission via pork in many countries, but now game animals are becoming a concern; anisakiasis is becoming a global problem as the world develops a taste for sushi, and similarly for opisthorchiasis, which is increasingly being associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, the emergence of these foodborne parasites provides an incentive for increased efforts being made toward control. In this chapter, having described how the parasites are emerging from their neglected position, the focus turns toward control. In addition to considering control measures that may be applied to the specific parasites, an overview is provided of some of the organized collaborations, projects, and consortia, as well as some of their outputs, that have in focus the control of these emerging and important pathogens.","Robertson, Lucy J.",Adv Food Nutr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30077225/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043452618300408; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043452618300408; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.afnr.2018.04.003,614

Method: A cross-sectional and prospective observational study, undertaken in a virtual environment. An online survey was developed and employed through Google Forms to collect data. The survey was made available to participants on social networks, Facebook@, Whatsapp@, and Instagram@, linked to the research group, during the period 06/15/2020 to 07/15/2020. 1,145 individuals participated in the research. Results: The average age of the participants was 37 years old. They were mostly female, white, Brazilians, with a higher education level, with occupations in the health field, and had religion. They either maintained their family income or suffered a small income decrease. Moreover, they informed that they were caring for social isolation. The most used substances before and after the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic were alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, although the use of these substances decreased (P<0.001). Approximately 32% of the participants started using psychoactive substances in this period. Among them, most individuals started by their own initiative. Conclusions: For a better understanding of the pattern use of psychoactive substances during the Covid-19 pandemic and the adverse effects on human behavior and mental disorders, careful longitudinal studies must be developed, due to the great interest in the knowledge of adaptive responses when people's lives are at risk.","Weber, C.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the oral health of adults in Wuhan and other places of China amid the epidemic and to evaluate attitudes towards dental care in the post-epidemic period. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey based on a questionnaire of 22 questions was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 3352 valid questionnaires were collected. Participants from Wuhan tended to be relatively psychologically affected and more concerned about future dental treatment. Toothbrushing frequency did not differ significantly between participants from Wuhan and other places and was associated with the prevalence of oral problems people encountered. Gingival bleeding, bad breath and oral ulcers were the three most common oral problems amid the epidemic, and significantly more participants in Wuhan experienced oral problems than other places in China. CONCLUSION: The three most common oral problems amid the epidemic were gingival bleeding, bad breath and oral ulcers. Adults in Wuhan tended to be more seriously affected and suffered more oral problems than people from other places in China. Maintaining good oral health behaviours plays an important role in preventing dental problems. It is crucial to establish and to follow the standard guidelines for the provision of dental care during and after the epidemic.

Instead of this unbalanced and asymmetric approach, the best way forward for constructionists is to treat all claims made by any and all acting parties as putative, not necessarily true or false, and to avoid making any independent claims about the actual social conditions that actors are striving to define. Since this time, social problems research, science and technology studies, and environmental sociology have encountered both epistemic and political difficulties with this strict constructionist approach to being fully agnostic about social conditions and the reality of actors’ claims. Drawing on the social pragmatism of George Herbert Mead, I consider some of the problems encountered in the strict constructionist approach, and argue that ultimately, the sociologist herself cannot escape the general problem of having to make objective claims about the empirical social world. Instead of being agnostic about all claims made, sociologists are best to fully accept the responsibility and advantages of being full blown claimsmakers themselves.","Puddephatt, Antony J.",Am Sociol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-021-09493-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176949/,614

SARS-CoV-2 has since become a pandemic virus resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and deep socioeconomic implications worldwide. In recent months, efforts have been directed towards detecting, tracking, and better understanding human humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has become critical to develop robust and reliable serological assays to characterize the abundance, neutralization efficiency, and duration of antibodies in virus-exposed individuals. Here we review the latest knowledge on humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with the benefits and limitations of currently available commercial and laboratory-based serological assays. We also highlight important serological considerations, such as antibody expression levels, stability and neutralization dynamics, as well as cross-reactivity and possible immunological back-boosting by seasonal coronaviruses. The ability to accurately detect, measure and characterize the various antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for vaccine development, manage risk and exposure for healthcare and at-risk workers, and for monitoring reinfections with genetic variants and new strains of the virus. Having a thorough understanding of the benefits and cautions of standardized serological testing at a community level remains critically important in the design and implementation of future vaccination campaigns, epidemiological models of immunity, and public health measures that rely heavily on up-to-date knowledge of transmission dynamics.","Galipeau, Yannick; Greig, Matthew; Liu, George; Driedger, Matt; Langlois, Marc-André",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391281/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.610688,614

We observed increased valuing of self-direction, security, conformity, humility, caring, and universalism and a decrease in valuing hedonism. Individuals experienced decreased subjective and eudaimonic well-being, with women responding with stronger negative affect intensity relative to men. Finally, we identified that individuals who were more open to change before the COVID-19 pandemic responded with higher eudaimonic well-being two weeks into lockdown relative to their less open to change peers.

We consider here diffusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate.

The infection mainly presents as fever, cough, and breathing difficulty, and few patients develop very severe symptoms. The purpose of this review is to analyze the impact of the virus on the kidney. COVID-19 infection causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and is an independent risk factor for mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, direct viral damage, and immune-mediated damage play important roles in the pathogenesis. AKI in COVID-19 infection could be from the synergistic effect of virus-induced direct cytotropic effect and cytokine-induced systemic inflammatory response. AKI caused in the viral infection has been analyzed from the available epidemiological studies. The proportion of patients developing AKI is significantly higher when they develop severe disease. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the most used blood purification technique when needed. The impact of COVID-19 infection on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal transplant patients is also discussed in the manuscript. No vaccine has been developed against the 2019-nCoV virus to date. The critical aspect of management is supportive care.

With tens of millions infected, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection will be a major health care focus for years after the contagion subsides. Most complications stem from direct viral invasion provoking an over-exuberant inflammatory response driven by innate immune cells and activation of the clotting cascade causing thrombosis. Injury to individual organs and their protective linings are frequent presentations in respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. Reviewing the historical context of postviral fatiguing symptoms seems relevant to understanding reports of uneven recoveries and persistent symptoms that are emerging as “long-haul COVID-19.” The pandemic is also an unprecedented sociocultural event, transforming how people consider their health, gather in groups, and navigate their daily lives. The unprecedented sociocultural stresses of the pandemic will have an invisible, ubiquitous, and predictable impact on neurologic, endocrine, and immune functioning, even in people untouched by the virus. COVID-19 may also have a surprise or two in store, with unique clinical presentations and novel mechanisms of injury which are yet to clearly emerge. Although challenging and unfortunate, these times also represent a unique opportunity to start to unravel the physiology that underlie how viruses may trigger cancers, neurological disease, and postviral fatiguing syndromes.","Walitt, Brian; Bartrum, Elizabeth",Pain Rep,https://doi.org/10.1097/pr9.0000000000000887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615088/,614

METHOD: Reflection study based on the principlist bioethics of Beauchamps and Childress and in professional ethics, problematizing actions, and decisions of non-resuscitation in the pandemic. RESULTS: It is important to consider the patient's clinic, appropriation of treatment goals for people with comorbidities, elderly people, with less chance of surviving to resuscitation, or less quality of life, with the palliative care team, to avoid dysthanasia, use of scarce resources and greater exposure of professionals to contamination. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 increased the vulnerabilities of professionals and patients, impacting professional decisions and conduct more widely than important values such as the restriction of freedom. It propelled the population in general to rethink ethical and bioethical values regarding life and death, interfering in decisions about them, supported by human dignity.","Oliveira, H.

682504,Disparity in HIV Service Interruption in the Outbreak of COVID-19 in South Carolina,2020-08-27,"A central paradigm of immunity is that interferon (IFN) mediated antiviral responses precede the pro-inflammatory ones, optimizing host protection and minimizing collateral damage. Here, we report that for COVID-19 this does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 COVID-19 patients hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN production is both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they become critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 are produced before IFNs, in all patients, and persist for a prolonged time. By comparison, in 16 flu patients hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to COVID-19 and 24 milder non-hospitalized flu patients IFN-{lambda} and type I IFN are robustly induced, earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, while pro-inflammatory cytokines are only acutely and transiently produced. Notably, higher IFN-{lambda} levels in COVID-19 patients correlate with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance, and a higher IFN-{lambda}:type I IFN ratio with improved outcome of critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in COVID-19 patients correlate with longer hospitalization time and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu. These data point to an untuned antiviral response in COVID-19 contributing to persistent viral presence, hyperinflammation and respiratory failure.","Galani, I.

When individual variation in disease transmission is present, like for COVID-19, the number of secondary cases is often modelled using a negative binomial distribution. However, this may not be the best distribution to describe the underlying transmission process. We propose the use of three other offspring distributions to quantify heterogeneity in transmission, and we assess the possible bias in estimates of the offspring mean and its overdispersion when the data generating distribution is different from the one used for inference. We find that overdispersion estimates may be biased when there is a substantial amount of heterogeneity, and that the use of other distributions besides the negative binomial should be considered. We revisit three previously analysed COVID-19 datasets and quantify the proportion of cases responsible for 80% of transmission, p80%, while acknowledging the variation arising from the assumed offspring distribution. We find that the number of secondary cases for these datasets is better described by a Poisson-lognormal distribution.","Kremer, C.; Torneri, A.; Boesmans, S.; Meuwissen, H.; Verdonschot, S.; Vanden Driessche, K.; Althaus, C.

The unprecedented surge of mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19 is a new emerging challenge. Although a few studies documenting high incidence of mucormycosis in COVID -19 patients have recently emerged in literature, data pertaining to treatment outcomes in such cohorts is lacking. Here, we report our experience in management of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients at our tertiary care centre. METHOD: The clinical, imaging, histopathological and treatment data of 20 patients with mucormycosis (in setting of COVID-19) was analysed. RESULTS: 35% and 65 % of cases developed mucormycosis in setting of active and recovered COVID-19 infections respectively. Diabetes mellitus was documented in 80% cases, with 55% demonstrating HbA1c >10%. Steroid was administered in 80% during COVID-19 illness. Imaging demonstrated paranasal sinus (PNS), orbital and intracranial extension in 100%, 55% and 20% patients respectively. All received amphotericin and underwent endoscopic debridement, 20% underwent orbital decompression and 5% maxillectomy with orbital exenteration. 6/20(30%) patients died (4 with rhino-orbito-cerebral disease, 1 with extensive orbito-maxillary involvement and 1 sino-nasal disease). All 6 patients received steroids and documented poor glycaemic control. CONCLUSION: The strong association of hyperglycemia and steroid intake with mucormycosis in COVID-19 cases warrants judicious use of corticosteroids and optimal glycaemic control. Our study highlights that good clinical outcome can be achieved in invasive mucormycosis provided prompt treatment is instituted with aggressive surgical debridement and antifungal medication.","Kumari, Abha; Rao, Nusumu Purnachandra; Patnaik, Uma; Malik, Virender; Tevatia, Manvir Singh; Thakur, Shivali; Jaydevan, Jijesh; Saxena, Pavitra",Med J Armed Forces India,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.06.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123721001556; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123721001556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334896/,614

Initially, IFNλ was demonstrated to induce expression of interferon-stimulated genes and exert antiviral properties in a similar manner to type I IFNs. However, while IFNλ has been described to have largely overlapping expression and function with type I IFNs, it has become increasingly clear that type III IFNs also have distinct functions from type I IFNs. In contrast to type I IFNs, whose receptor is ubiquitously expressed, type III IFNs signal and function largely at barrier epithelial surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as the blood–brain barrier. In further support of unique functions for type III IFNs, single nucleotide polymorphisms in IFNL genes in humans are strongly associated with outcomes to viral infection. These biological linkages have also been more directly supported by studies in mice highlighting roles of IFNλ in promoting antiviral immune responses. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of type III IFNs, and how their functions are similar to, and different from, type I IFN in various immune cell subtypes and viral infections.","Hemann, Emily A.; Gale, Michael; Savan, Ram",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29270173/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01707,614

COVID‐19 was emerged due to the SARS‐CoV‐2 that is highly infectious pandemic. Every country tried to control the COVID‐19 spread by imposing different types of lockdowns. Therefore, there is an urgent need to forecast the daily confirmed infected cases and deaths in different types of lockdown to select the most appropriate lockdown strategies to control the intensity of this pandemic and reduce the burden in hospitals. Currently are imposed three types of lockdown (partial, herd, complete) in different countries. In this study, three countries from every type of lockdown were studied by applying time‐series and machine learning models, named as random forests, K‐nearest neighbors, SVM, decision trees (DTs), polynomial regression, Holt winter, ARIMA, and SARIMA to forecast daily confirm infected cases and deaths due to COVID‐19. The models' accuracy and effectiveness were evaluated by error based on three performance criteria. Actually, a single forecasting model could not capture all data sets' trends due to the varying nature of data sets and lockdown types. Three top‐ranked models were used to predict the confirmed infected cases and deaths, the outperformed models were also adopted for the out‐of‐sample prediction and obtained very close results to the actual values of cumulative infected cases and deaths due to COVID‐19.

It is also named “heat stress in transport”, causing morbidity and mass death. New variants of BPIV3 have been detected or isolated in China since 2008. Here, we isolate one BPIV3 strain (named BPIV3 BJ) in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells from nasal samples collected in China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that our isolate is related to BPIV3 of the genotype A. The comparison of BPIV3-BJ and the reference Chinese isolate NM09 showed that these strains are highly divergent. We found many differences in the amino acid composition in the nucleocapsid (NP) protein among these genotype A strains. Since the NP protein has been implicated in immunization studies, our BPIV3 isolate will be useful for the development of immune assays and vaccine studies. The diversity of BPIV3 lineages that we found in China indicated ongoing evolution for immune escape.

684348,Creation of a medical ward from non‐clinical space amidst the Covid‐19 pandemic,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) have evolved strategies to disable the innate immune system for productive replication and spread of infection. We have previously shown that papain-like protease domain 2 (PLP2), a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of MHV-A59, encodes a deubiquitinase (DUB) and inactivates IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) thereby the type I interferon (IFN) response. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we provide further evidence that PLP2 may also target TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1), the upstream kinase of IRF3 in the IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression experiments showed that PLP2 deubiquitinated TBK1 and reduced its kinase activity, hence inhibited IFN-β reporter activity. Albeit promiscuous in deubiquitinating cellular proteins, PLP2 inactivated TBK1 and IFN-β response in TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) deficient cells, suggesting that targeting TBK1 would be sufficient for PLP2 to inhibit IRF3 activation. This notion was further supported by in vitro kinase assays, in which prior treatment of TBK1 with PLP2 inhibited its kinase activity to phosphorylate IRF3. Intriguing enough, results of PLP2 overexpression system and MHV-A59 infection system proved that PLP2 formed an inactive complex with TBK1 and IRF3 in the cytoplasm and the presence of PLP2 stabilized the hypo-phosphorylated IRF3-TBK1 complex in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PLP2 not only inactivates TBK1, but also prevents IRF3 nuclear translocation hence inhibits IFN transcription activation. Identification of the conserved DUB activity of PLP2 in suppression of IFN signaling would provide a useful clue to the development of therapeutics against coronaviruses infection.","Wang, Gang; Chen, Gang; Zheng, Dahai; Cheng, Genhong; Tang, Hong",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364999/,614

We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England. MethodsThe serosurveillance cohort included office and laboratory-based staff and healthcare workers in 4 sites in England, who were tested monthly for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein IgG between 23rd March and 20th August 2020. Antibody levels from 21 days after a positive test were modelled using mixed effects regression models. FindingsIn total, 2247 individuals were recruited and 2014 (90%) had 3-5 monthly antibody tests. Overall, 272 (12.1%) of individuals had at least one positive/equivocal spike protein IgG result, with the highest proportion in a hospital site (22%), 14% in London and 2.1% in a rural area. Results were similar for nucleoprotein IgG. Following a positive result, 39/587 (6.6%) tested negative for nucleoprotein IgG and 52/515 (10.1%) for spike protein IgG. Nucleoprotein IgG declined by 6.4% per week (95% CI, 5.5-7.4%; half-life, 75 [95% CI, 66-89] days) and spike protein IgG by 5.8% (95% CI, 5.1-6.6%; half-life, 83 [95% CI, 73-96] days). ConclusionsOver the study period SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 8-10% overall and up to 21% in clinical healthcare workers.

686230,Determinants of intent to uptake Coronavirus vaccination among respondents in Saudi Arabia: a web-based national survey,2020-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Subgroups of precarious populations such as homeless people are more exposed to infection and at higher risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 compared to the general population. Many of the recommended prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, are not feasible for a population living in shelters characterised by physical proximity and a high population density. The objective of the study was to describe SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in homeless shelters in Brussels (Belgium), and to identify risk factors and infection control practices associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. METHODS: A total of 1994 adults were tested by quantitative PCR tests in 52 shelters in Brussels (Belgium) between April and June, 2020, in collaboration with Doctors of the World. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is here described site by site, and we identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. We also investigate associations between seropositivity and reported symptoms. RESULTS: We found an overall prevalence of 4.6% for the period, and a cluster of high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (20–30% in two shelters). Among homeless people, being under 40 years of age (OR (CI95%) 2.3 (1.2–4.4), p = 0.02), having access to urgent medical care (AMU) (OR(CI95%): 2.4 (1.4–4.4)], p = 0.02), and sharing a room with someone who tested positive (OR(CI95%): 5.3 (2.9–9.9), p<0.0001) were factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. 93% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This study shows high rates of SARS-COV-2 infection positive tests in some shelters, with a high proportion of asymptomatic cases. The survey reveals how important testing and isolation measures are, together with actions taken by medical and social workers during the outbreak.","Roland, Michel; Ben Abdelhafidh, Louisa; Déom, Victoria; Vanbiervliet, Frank; Coppieters, Yves; Racapé, Judith",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129635/,614

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, characterised by an outer lipid membrane derived from the host cell from which it buds. While, it is highly sensitive to agents that disrupt lipid bio-membranes, there has been no discussion about the potential role of oral rinsing in preventing transmission. Here, we review known mechanisms of viral lipid membrane disruption by widely available dental mouthwash components that include ethanol, chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine. We also assess existing formulations for their potential ability to disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 lipid envelope, based on their concentrations of these agents, and conclude that several deserve clinical evaluation. We highlight that already published research on other enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, directly support the idea that oral rinsing should be considered as a potential way to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Research to test this could include evaluating existing or specifically-tailored new formulations in well-designed viral inactivation assays, then in clinical trials. Population-based interventions could be undertaken with available mouthwashes, with active monitoring of outcome to determine efficacy. This is an under-researched area of major clinical need.","O’Donnell, Valerie B; Thomas, David; Stanton, Richard; Maillard, Jean-Yves; Murphy, Robert C; Jones, Simon A; Humphreys, Ian; Wakelam, Michael J O; Fegan, Christopher; Wise, Matt P; Bosch, Albert; Sattar, Syed A",Function,https://doi.org/10.1093/function/zqaa002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215159/,614

We include 34,128 (US: 8362, South Korea: 7341, Spain: 18,425) COVID-19 patients, summarising between 4811 and 11,643 unique aggregate characteristics. COVID-19 patients have been majority male in the US and Spain, but predominantly female in South Korea. Age profiles vary across data sources. Compared to 84,585 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, COVID-19 patients have more typically been male, younger, and with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. While protecting groups vulnerable to influenza is likely a useful starting point in the response to COVID-19, strategies will likely need to be broadened to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals being hospitalised with COVID-19.","Burn, Edward; You, Seng Chan; Sena, Anthony G.; Kostka, Kristin; Abedtash, Hamed; Abrahão, Maria Tereza F.; Alberga, Amanda; Alghoul, Heba; Alser, Osaid; Alshammari, Thamir M.; Aragon, Maria; Areia, Carlos; Banda, Juan M.; Cho, Jaehyeong; Culhane, Aedin C.; Davydov, Alexander; DeFalco, Frank J.; Duarte-Salles, Talita; DuVall, Scott; Falconer, Thomas; Fernandez-Bertolin, Sergio; Gao, Weihua; Golozar, Asieh; Hardin, Jill; Hripcsak, George; Huser, Vojtech; Jeon, Hokyun; Jing, Yonghua; Jung, Chi Young; Kaas-Hansen, Benjamin Skov; Kaduk, Denys; Kent, Seamus; Kim, Yeesuk; Kolovos, Spyros; Lane, Jennifer C.

Subunit vaccines use one or more antigens suitable for eliciting a robust immune response. However, the major concern is the efficacy of subunit vaccines and elicited antibodies to neutralize the variants of SARS-CoV-2 like B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P1 (Gamma), B.1.617 (Delta) and C.37 (Lambda). The Spike protein (S) is a potential fragment for use as an antigen in vaccine development. This protein plays a crucial role in the first step of the infection process, as it binds to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enters the host cell after binding. Immunization-induced specific antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) may block and effectively prevent virus invasion. The focus of this review is the impact of spike mutated variants of SARS-CoV2 (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Lambda) on the efficacy of subunit recombinant vaccines. To date, a low or no significant impact on vaccine efficacy against Alpha and Delta variants has been reported. Such an impact on vaccine efficacy for Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Lambda variants may be even greater compared to the Alpha variant. Nonetheless, more comprehensive analyses are needed to assess the real impact on vaccine efficacy brought about by SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Mohammadi, Mehrdad; Shayestehpour, Mohammad; Mirzaei, Hamed",Braz J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2021.101606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34428473/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867021000751?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867021000751,614

They use PI4K to generate membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositide 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P or PI4P) lipids, which can be used as replication platforms. Viral replication machinery is assembled on these platforms as a supramolecular complex and PtdIns4P lipids regulate viral RNA synthesis.

PPE usage causes headache in majority of users. We evaluated changes in cerebral hemodynamics among healthcare-workers using PPE. METHODS: Frontline healthcare-workers donning PPE at our tertiary center were included. Demographics, co-morbidities and blood-pressure were recorded. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery was performed with 2-MHz probe. Mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were recorded at baseline, after donning N95 respirator-mask, and after donning powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), when indicated. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (ET-CO2) pressure was recorded for participants donning PAPR in addition to the N95 respirator-mask. RESULTS: A total of 154 healthcare-workers (mean age 29 ± 12 years, 67% women) were included. Migraine was the commonest co-morbidity in 38 (25%) individuals while 123 (80%) developed de-novo headache due to N95 mask. Donning of N95 respirator-mask resulted in significant increase in MFV (4.4 ± 10.4 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decrease in PI (0.13 ± 0.12; p < 0.001) while ET-CO2 increased by 3.1 ± 1.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). TCD monitoring in 24 (16%) participants donning PAPR and N95 respirator mask together showed normalization of PI, accompanied by normalization of ET-CO2 values within 5-min. Combined use of N95 respirator-mask and PAPR was more comfortable as compared to N95 respirator-mask alone. CONCLUSION: Use of N95 respirator-mask results in significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. However, these effects are mitigated by the use of additional PAPR. We recommend the use of PAPR together with the N95 mask for healthcare-workers doing longer duties in the hospital wards.","Bharatendu, Chandra; Ong, Jonathan J.Y.; Goh, Yihui; Tan, Benjamin Y.Q.; Chan, Amanda C.Y.; Tang, Jonathan Z.Y.; Leow, Aloysius S.; Chin, Amanda; Sooi, Kenneth W.X.; Tan, Yi Lin; Hong, Chiew S.; Chin, Benjamin Z.; Ng, Elizabeth; Foong, Theng Wai; Teoh, Hock Luen; Ong, Shi Ting; Lee, Pyng; Khoo, Deborah; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Alexandrov, Andrei V.; Sharma, Vijay K.",J Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768718/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20304159; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117078; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20304159?v=s5,614

METHODS: Using a thematic analysis approach, a qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 97 health care professionals. Participants were health care professionals including pre-hospital emergency services (EMS), physicians, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, radiology technicians, hospital managers and managers in the ministry of health who work directly or indirectly with COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Data analysis highlighted four main themes, namely: ‘Working in the pandemic era’, ‘Changes in personal life and enhanced negative affect’, ‘Gaining experience, normalization and adaptation to the pandemic’ and ‘Mental Health Considerations’ which indicated that mental ill deteriorations unfolded through a stage-wise process as the pandemic unfolded. CONCLUSIONS: Participants experienced a wide range of emotions and development during the unfolding of the pandemic.

689501,Analysis of the service telessaúde-COVID in a municipality of Minas Gerais.,2021,"BACKGROUND: Plasminogen (Pg), the precursor of the proteolytic and fibrinolytic enzyme of blood, is converted to the active enzyme plasmin (Pm) by different plasminogen activators (tissue plasminogen activators and urokinase), including the bacterial activators streptokinase and staphylokinase, which activate Pg to Pm and thus are used clinically for thrombolysis. The identification of Pg-activators is therefore an important step in understanding their functional mechanism and derives new therapies. METHODS: In this study, different computational methods for predicting plasminogen activator peptide sequences with high accuracy were investigated, including support vector machines (SVM) based on amino acid (AC), dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid methods used to predict different Pg-activators from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins. RESULTS: Overall maximum accuracy, evaluated using the five-fold cross validation technique, was 88.37%, 84.32%, 87.61%, 85.63% in 0.87, 0.83,0.86 and 0.85 MCC with amino (AC) or dipeptide composition (DC), PSSM profile and Hybrid methods respectively. Through this study, we have found that the different subfamilies of Pg-activators are quite closely correlated in terms of amino, dipeptide, PSSM and Hybrid compositions. Therefore, our prediction results show that plasminogen activators are predictable with a high accuracy from their primary sequence. Prediction performance was also cross-checked by confusion matrix and ROC (Receiver operating characteristics) analysis. A web server to facilitate the prediction of Pg-activators from primary sequence data was implemented. CONCLUSION: The results show that dipeptide, PSSM profile, and Hybrid based methods perform better than single amino acid composition (AC). Furthermore, we also have developed a web server, which predicts the Pg-activators and their classification (available online at http://mamsap.it.deakin.edu.au/plas_pred/home.html).

689618,Making sense of the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative longitudinal study investigating the first and second wave in Italy,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: We propose an economical cervical screening research and implementation strategy designed to take into account the typically slow natural history of cervical cancer and the severe but hopefully temporary impact of COVID-19. The commentary introduces the practical validation of some critical components of the strategy, described in three manuscripts detailing recent project results in Asia and Africa. The main phases of a cervical screening program are 1) primary screening of women in the general population, 2) triage testing of the small minority of women that screen positive to determine need for treatment, and 3) treatment of triage-positive women thought to be at highest risk of precancer or even cancer. In each phase, attention must now be paid to safety in relation to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The new imperatives of the COVID-19 pandemic support self-sampled HPV testing as the primary cervical screening method. Most women can be reassured for several years by a negative test performed on a self-sample collected at home, without need of clinic visit and speculum examination. The advent of relatively inexpensive, rapid and accurate HPV DNA testing makes it possible to return screening results from self-sampling very soon after specimen collection, minimizing loss to follow-up. Partial HPV typing provides important risk stratification useful for triage of HPV-positive women. A second “triage” test is often useful to guide management. In lower-resource settings, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is still proposed but it is inaccurate and poorly reproducible, misclassifying the risk stratification gained by primary HPV testing. A deep-learning based approach to recognizing cervical precancer, adaptable to a smartphone camera, is being validated to improve VIA performance. The advent and approval of thermal ablation permits quick, affordable and safe, immediate treatment at the triage clinic of the majority of HPV-positive, triage-positive women. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, only a small percentage of women in cervical screening programs need to attend the hospital clinic for a surgical procedure, particularly when screening is targeted to the optimal age range for detection of precancer rather than older ages with decreased visual screening performance and higher risks of hard-to-treat outcomes including invasive cancer.","Ajenifuja, Kayode Olusegun; Belinson, Jerome; Goldstein, Andrew; Desai, Kanan T.; de Sanjose, Silvia; Schiffman, Mark",Infect Agent Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13027-020-00325-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072179/,614
689708,Lessons from the frontlines: a junior doctor’s experience of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-limited setting,2021-05-10,"Abstract Concerns have been raised about both the disinfection and the reusability of respiratory protective equipment following a disinfection process. Currently, there is little data available on the effects of disinfection and decontamination on positive pressure respiratory protective hoods (PPRPH). In this study, we evaluated the effect of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) on the disinfection of PPRPH to determine applicability of this method for disinfection of protective equipment, especially protective equipment with an electric supply system. A hydrogen peroxide-based fumigation sterilization cabinet was developed particularly for disinfection of protective equipment, and the disinfection experiments were conducted using four PPRPHs hung in the fumigation chamber. The pathogenic microorganism Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 was used as a biological indicator in this study and the relationship between air flow (the amount of VHP) and disinfection was investigated. Both function and the material physical properties of the PPRPH were assessed following the disinfection procedure. No surviving Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953, both inside and outside of these disinfected PPRPHs, could be observed after a 60 min treatment with an air flow of 10.5–12.3 m3/h. Both function and material physical properties of these PPRPHs met the working requirements after disinfection. This study indicates that air flow in the fumigation chamber directly influences the concentration of VHP. The protective equipment fumigation sterilization cabinet developed in this paper achieves the complete sterilization of the PPRPHs when the air flow is at 10.5–12.3 m3/h, and provides a potential solution for the disinfection of various kind of protective equipment.","Hao, Limei; Wu, Jinhui; Zhang, Enlei; Yi, Ying; Zhang, Zongxing; Zhang, Jinming; Qi, Jiancheng",Biosafety and Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2019.02.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053619300060; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053619300060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501442/,614
689880,Correlates of Psychological Distress Among Pakistani Adults During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Parallel and Serial Mediation Analyses,2021-03-31,"Hygiene measures were intensified when the COVID-19 pandemic began. Patient contacts were limited to a minimum. Visitors were either not allowed for a certain period or limited for the rest of the time. The hospital staff began to wear masks and gloves continuously. Clinical examinations and routine wound controls were also performed under intensified hygiene standards. These circumstances result in a limitation of direct physical interactions between the nursing staff, the physicians and the patients. We analyzed to what extent the intensification of hygiene measures affects the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) after neurosurgical procedures. The rate of SSI during the 6-month interval after the beginning of COVID-19 measures was compared with the SSI rate before. The numbers of the period before COVID-19 were analyzed as mean values resulting from the analysis of two separate time periods each consisting of 6 months. The spectrum of surgical procedures was compared. Patient-related risk factors for SSIs were noted. Microorganisms were analyzed. We focused on SSIs occurring at a maximum of 60 days after the primary surgery. Overall, in the two respective 6-month periods before COVID-19, a mean of 1379 patients was surgically treated in our institution. After the beginning of COVID-19 (starting from 04/2020) our surgical numbers dropped by 101, resulting in a total number of 1278 patients being operated after 03/2020 until 09/2020. The SSI rate was 3.6% (03/2019–09/2019, 50 SSIs) and 2.2% (09/2019–03/2020, 29 SSIs), resulting in a mean of 2.9% before COVID-19 began. After the beginning of COVID-19 hygiene measures, this rate dropped to 1.4% (16 SSIs) resembling a significant reduction (p=0.003). Risk factors for the development of SSI were present in 81.3% of all patients. Pre- and post-COVID-19 patient groups had similar baseline characteristics. The same holds true when comparing the percentage of cranial and spinal procedures pre- and post-COVID-19 (p=0.91). Comparing the numbers (p=0.28) and the species (p=0.85) of microorganisms (MO) causing SSI, we found a similar distribution. Despite equal demographics and characteristics of SSI, the rate of SSI dropped substantially. This argues for an effective reduction of postoperative SSI resulting from the implementation of strict hygiene measures being established after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore advocate continuing with strict and intensive hygiene measures in the future.","Chacón-Quesada, T.; Rohde, V.; von der Brelie, C.",Neurosurg Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-021-01513-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33674981/,614
